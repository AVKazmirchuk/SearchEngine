right outside unless i m mighty mistaken said ranse opening the door and beckoning curly walked in no one could have doubted the old man and the young had the same sweep of hair the same nose chin line of face and prominent light blue eyes old kiowa rose eagerly curly looked about the room curiously a puzzled expression came over his face he pointed to the wall opposite where s the tick tock he asked absent mindedly the clock cried old kiowa loudly the eight day clock used to stand there why he turned to ranse but ranse was not there already a hundred yards away vaminos the good flea bitten dun was bearing him eastward like a racer through dust and chaparral towards the rancho de los olmos cupid a la carte the dispositions of woman said jeff peters after various opinions on the subject had been advanced run regular to diversions what a woman wants is what you re out of she wants more of a thing when it s scarce she likes to have souvenirs of things that never happened she likes to be reminded of things she never heard of a one sided view of objects is disjointing to the female composition tis a misfortune of mine begotten by nature and travel continued jeff looking thoughtfully between his elevated feet at the grocery stove to look deeper into some subjects than most people do i ve breathed gasoline smoke talking to street crowds in nearly every town in the united states i ve held em spellbound with music oratory sleight of hand and prevarications while i ve sold em jewelry medicine soap hair tonic and junk of other nominations and during my travels as a matter of recreation and expiation i ve taken cognisance some of women it takes a man a lifetime to find out about one particular woman but if he puts in say ten years industrious and curious he can acquire the general rudiments of the sex one lesson i picked up was when i was working the west with a line of brazilian diamonds and a patent fire kindler just after my trip from savannah down through the cotton belt with dalby s anti explosive lamp oil powder twas when the oklahoma country was in first bloom guthrie was rising in the middle of it like a lump of self raising dough it was a boom town of the regular kind you stood in line to get a chance to wash your face if you ate over ten minutes you had a lodging bill added on if you slept on a plank at night they charged it to you as board the next morning by nature and doctrines i am addicted to the habit of discovering choice places wherein to feed so i looked around and found a proposition that exactly cut the mustard i found a restaurant tent just opened up by an outfit that had drifted in on the tail of the boom they had knocked together a box house where they lived and did the cooking and served the meals in a tent pitched against the side that tent was joyful with placards on it calculated to redeem the world worn pilgrim from the sinfulness of boarding houses and pick me up hotels try mother s home made biscuits what s the matter with our apple dumplings and hard sauce hot cakes and maple syrup like you ate when a boy our fried chicken never was heard to crow there was literature doomed to please the digestions of man i said to myself that mother s wandering boy should munch there that night and so it came to pass and there is where i contracted my case of mame dugan old man dugan was six feet by one of indiana loafer and he spent his time sitting on his shoulder blades in a rocking chair in the shanty memorialising the great corn crop failure of ma dugan did the cooking and mame waited on the table as soon as i saw mame i knew there was a mistake in the census reports there wasn t but one girl in the united states when you come to specifications it isn t easy she was about the size of an angel and she had eyes and ways about her when you come to the kind of a girl she was you ll find a belt of em reaching from the brooklyn bridge west as far as the courthouse in council bluffs ia they earn their own living in stores restaurants factories and offices they re chummy and honest and free and tender and sassy and they look life straight in the eye they ve met man face to face and discovered that he s a poor creature they ve dropped to it that the reports in the seaside library about his being a fairy prince lack confirmation mame was that sort she was full of life and fun and breezy she passed the repartee with the boarders quick as a wink you d have smothered laughing i am disinclined to make excavations into the insides of a personal affection i am glued to the theory that the diversions and discrepancies of the indisposition known as love should be as private a sentiment as a toothbrush tis my opinion that the biographies of the heart should be confined with the historical romances of the liver to the advertising pages of the magazines so you ll excuse the lack of an itemised bill of my feelings toward mame pretty soon i got a regular habit of dropping into the tent to eat at irregular times when there wasn t so many around mame would sail in with a smile in a black dress and white apron and say hello jeff why don t you come at mealtime want to see how much trouble you can be of course friedchickenbeefsteakporkchopshamandeggspotpie and so on she called me jeff but there was no significations attached designations was all she meant the front names of any of us she used as they came to hand i d eat about two meals before i left and string em out like a society spread where they changed plates and wives and josh one another festively between bites mame stood for it pleasant for it wasn t up to her to take any canvas off the tent by declining dollars just because they were whipped in after meal times it wasn t long until there was another fellow named ed collier got the between meals affliction and him and me put in bridges between breakfast and dinner and dinner and supper that made a three ringed circus of that tent and mame s turn as waiter a continuous performance that collier man was saturated with designs and contrivings he was in well boring or insurance or claim jumping or something i ve forgotten which he was a man well lubricated with gentility and his words were such as recommended you to his point of view so collier and me infested the grub tent with care and activity mame was level full of impartiality twas like a casino hand the way she dealt out her favours one to collier and one to me and one to the board and not a card up her sleeve me and collier naturally got acquainted and gravitated together some on the outside divested of his stratagems he seemed to be a pleasant chap full of an amiable sort of hostility i notice you have an affinity for grubbing in the banquet hall after the guests have fled says i to him one day to draw his conclusions well yes says collier reflecting the tumult of a crowded board seems to harass my sensitive nerves it exasperates mine some too says i nice little girl don t you think i see says collier laughing well now that you mention it i have noticed that she doesn t seem to displease the optic nerve she s a joy to mine says i and i m going after her notice is hereby served i ll be as candid as you admits collier and if the drug stores don t run out of pepsin i ll give you a run for your money that ll leave you a dyspeptic at the wind up so collier and me begins the race the grub department lays in new supplies mame waits on us jolly and kind and agreeable and it looks like an even break with cupid and the cook working overtime in dugan s restaurant twas one night in september when i got mame to take a walk after supper when the things were all cleared away we strolled out a distance and sat on a pile of lumber at the edge of town such opportunities was seldom so i spoke my piece explaining how the brazilian diamonds and the fire kindler were laying up sufficient treasure to guarantee the happiness of two and that both of em together couldn t equal the light from somebody s eyes and that the name of dugan should be changed to peters or reasons why not would be in order mame didn t say anything right away directly she gave a kind of shudder and i began to learn something jeff she says i m sorry you spoke i like you as well as any of them but there isn t a man in the world i d ever marry and there never will be do you know what a man is in my eye he s a tomb he s a sarcophagus for the interment of beafsteakporkchopsliver nbaconham andeggs he s that and nothing more for two years i ve watched men eat eat eat until they represent nothing on earth to me but ruminant bipeds they re absolutely nothing but something that goes in front of a knife and fork and plate at the table they re fixed that way in my mind and memory i ve tried to overcome it but i can t i ve heard girls rave about their sweethearts but i never could understand it a man and a sausage grinder and a pantry awake in me exactly the same sentiments i went to a matinee once to see an actor the girls were crazy about i got interested enough to wonder whether he liked his steak rare medium or well done and his eggs over or straight up that was all no jeff i ll marry no man and see him sit at the breakfast table and eat and come back to dinner and eat and happen in again at supper to eat eat eat but mame says i it ll wear off you ve had too much of it you ll marry some time of course men don t eat always as far as my observation goes they do no i ll tell you what i m going to do mame turns sudden to animation and bright eyes there s a girl named susie foster in terre haute a chum of mine she waits in the railroad eating house there i worked two years in a restaurant in that town susie has it worse than i do because the men who eat at railroad stations gobble they try to flirt and gobble at the same time whew susie and i have it all planned out we re saving our money and when we get enough we re going to buy a little cottage and five acres we know of and live together and grow violets for the eastern market a man better not bring his appetite within a mile of that ranch don t girls ever i commenced but mame heads me off sharp no they don t they nibble a little bit sometimes that s all i thought the confect for goodness sake change the subject says mame as i said before that experience puts me wise that the feminine arrangement ever struggles after deceptions and illusions take england beef made her wieners elevated germany uncle sam owes his greatness to fried chicken and pie but the young ladies of the shetalkyou schools they ll never believe it shakespeare they allow and rubinstein and the rough riders is what did the trick twas a situation calculated to disturb i couldn t bear to give up mame and yet it pained me to think of abandoning the practice of eating i had acquired the habit too early for twenty seven years i had been blindly rushing upon my fate yielding to the insidious lures of that deadly monster food it was too late i was a ruminant biped for keeps it was lobster salad to a doughnut that my life was going to be blighted by it i continued to board at the dugan tent hoping that mame would relent i had sufficient faith in true love to believe that since it has often outlived the absence of a square meal it might in time overcome the presence of one i went on ministering to my fatal vice although i felt that each time i shoved a potato into my mouth in mame s presence i might be burying my fondest hopes i think collier must have spoken to mame and got the same answer for one day he orders a cup of coffee and a cracker and sits nibbling the corner of it like a girl in the parlour that s filled up in the kitchen previous on cold roast and fried cabbage i caught on and did the same and maybe we thought we d made a hit the next day we tried it again and out comes old man dugan fetching in his hands the fairy viands kinder off yer feed ain t ye gents he asks fatherly and some sardonic thought i d spell mame a bit seein the work was light and my rheumatiz can stand the strain so back me and collier had to drop to the heavy grub again i noticed about that time that i was seized by a most uncommon and devastating appetite i ate until mame must have hated to see me darken the door afterward i found out that i had been made the victim of the first dark and irreligious trick played on me by ed collier him and me had been taking drinks together uptown regular trying to drown our thirst for food that man had bribed about ten bartenders to always put a big slug of appletree s anaconda appetite bitters in every one of my drinks but the last trick he played me was hardest to forget one day collier failed to show up at the tent a man told me he left town that morning my only rival now was the bill of fare a few days before he left collier had presented me with a two gallon jug of fine whisky which he said a cousin had sent him from kentucky i now have reason to believe that it contained appletree s anaconda appetite bitters almost exclusively i continued to devour tons of provisions in mame s eyes i remained a mere biped more ruminant than ever about a week after collier pulled his freight there came a kind of side show to town and hoisted a tent near the railroad i judged it was a sort of fake museum and curiosity business i called to see mame one night and ma dugan said that she and thomas her younger brother had gone to the show that same thing happened for three nights that week saturday night i caught her on the way coming back and got to sit on the steps a while and talk to her i noticed she looked different her eyes were softer and shiny like instead of a mame dugan to fly from the voracity of man and raise violets she seemed to be a mame more in line as god intended her approachable and suited to bask in the light of the brazilians and the kindler you seem to be right smart inveigled says i with the unparalleled exhibition of the world s living curiosities and wonders it s a change says mame you ll need another says i if you keep on going every night don t be cross jeff says she it takes my mind off business don t the curiosities eat i ask not all of them some of them are wax look out then that you don t get stuck says i kind of flip and foolish mame blushed i didn t know what to think about her my hopes raised some that perhaps my attentions had palliated man s awful crime of visibly introducing nourishment into his system she talked some about the stars referring to them with respect and politeness and i drivelled a quantity about united hearts homes made bright by true affection and the kindler mame listened without scorn and i says to myself jeff old man you re removing the hoodoo that has clung to the consumer of victuals you re setting your heel upon the serpent that lurks in the gravy bowl monday night i drop around mame is at the unparalleled exhibition with thomas now may the curse of the forty one seven sided sea cooks says i and the bad luck of the nine impenitent grasshoppers rest upon this self same sideshow at once and forever more amen i ll go to see it myself to morrow night and investigate its baleful charm shall man that was made to inherit the earth be bereft of his sweetheart first by a knife and fork and then by a ten cent circus the next night before starting out for the exhibition tent i inquire and find out that mame is not at home she is not at the circus with thomas this time for thomas waylays me in the grass outside of the grub tent with a scheme of his own before i had time to eat supper what ll you give me jeff says he if i tell you something the value of it son i says sis is stuck on a freak says thomas one of the side show freaks i don t like him she does i overheard em talking thought maybe you d like to know say jeff does it put you wise two dollars worth there s a target rifle up town that i frisked my pockets and commenced to dribble a stream of halves and quarters into thomas s hat the information was of the pile driver system of news and it telescoped my intellects for a while while i was leaking small change and smiling foolish on the outside and suffering disturbances internally i was saying idiotically and pleasantly thank you thomas thank you er a freak you said thomas now could you make out the monstrosity s entitlements a little clearer if you please thomas this is the fellow says thomas pulling out a yellow handbill from his pocket and shoving it under my nose he s the champion faster of the universe i guess that s why sis got soft on him he don t eat nothing he s going to fast forty nine days this is the sixth that s him i looked at the name thomas pointed out professor eduardo collieri ah says i in admiration that s not so bad ed collier i give you credit for the trick but i don t give you the girl until she s mrs freak i hit the sod in the direction of the show i came up to the rear of the tent and as i did so a man wiggled out like a snake from under the bottom of the canvas scrambled to his feet and ran into me like a locoed bronco i gathered him by the neck and investigated him by the light of the stars it is professor eduardo collieri in human habiliments with a desperate look in one eye and impatience in the other hello curiosity says i get still a minute and let s have a look at your freakship how do you like being the willopus wallopus or the bim bam from borneo or whatever name you are denounced by in the side show business jeff peters says collier in a weak voice turn me loose or i ll slug you one i m in the extremest kind of a large hurry hands off tut tut eddie i answers holding him hard let an old friend gaze on the exhibition of your curiousness it s an eminent graft you fell onto my son but don t speak of assaults and battery because you re not fit the best you ve got is a lot of nerve and a mighty empty stomach and so it was the man was as weak as a vegetarian cat i d argue this case with you jeff says he regretful in his style for an unlimited number of rounds if i had half an hour to train in and a slab of beefsteak two feet square to train with curse the man i say that invented the art of going foodless may his soul in eternity be chained up within two feet of a bottomless pit of red hot hash i m abandoning the conflict jeff i m deserting to the enemy you ll find miss dugan inside contemplating the only living mummy and the informed hog she s a fine girl jeff i d have beat you out if i could have kept up the grubless habit a little while longer you ll have to admit that the fasting dodge was aces up for a while i figured it out that way but say jeff it s said that love makes the world go around let me tell you the announcement lacks verification it s the wind from the dinner horn that does it i love that mame dugan i ve gone six days without food in order to coincide with her sentiments only one bite did i have that was when i knocked the tattooed man down with a war club and got a sandwich he was gobbling the manager fined me all my salary but salary wasn t what i was after twas that girl i d give my life for her but i d endanger my immortal soul for a beef stew hunger is a horrible thing jeff love and business and family and religion and art and patriotism are nothing but shadows of words when a man s starving in such language ed collier discoursed to me pathetic i gathered the diagnosis that his affections and his digestions had been implicated in a scramble and the commissary had won out i never disliked ed collier i searched my internal admonitions of suitable etiquette to see if i could find a remark of a consoling nature but there was none convenient i d be glad now says ed if you ll let me go i ve been hard hit but i ll hit the ration supply harder i m going to clean out every restaurant in town i m going to wade waist deep in sirloins and swim in ham and eggs it s an awful thing jeff peters for a man to come to this pass to give up his girl for something to eat it s worse than that man esau that swapped his copyright for a partridge but then hunger s a fierce thing you ll excuse me now jeff for i smell a pervasion of ham frying in the distance and my legs are crying out to stampede in that direction a hearty meal to you ed collier i says to him and no hard feelings for myself i am projected to be an unseldom eater and i have condolence for your predicaments there was a sudden big whiff of frying ham smell on the breeze and the champion faster gives a snort and gallops off in the dark toward fodder i wish some of the cultured outfit that are always advertising the extenuating circumstances of love and romance had been there to see there was ed collier a fine man full of contrivances and flirtations abandoning the girl of his heart and ripping out into the contiguous territory in the pursuit of sordid grub twas a rebuke to the poets and a slap at the best paying element of fiction an empty stomach is a sure antidote to an overfull heart i was naturally anxious to know how far mame was infatuated with collier and his stratagems i went inside the unparalleled exhibition and there she was she looked surprised to see me but unguilty it s an elegant evening outside says i the coolness is quite nice and gratifying and the stars are lined out first class up where they belong wouldn t you shake these by products of the animal kingdom long enough to take a walk with a common human who never was on a programme in his life mame gave a sort of sly glance around and i knew what that meant oh says i i hate to tell you but the curiosity that lives on wind has flew the coop he just crawled out under the tent by this time he has amalgamated himself with half the delicatessen truck in town you mean ed collier says mame i do i answers and a pity it is that he has gone back to crime again i met him outside the tent and he exposed his intentions of devastating the food crop of the world tis enormously sad when one s ideal descends from his pedestal to make a seventeen year locust of himself mame looked me straight in the eye until she had corkscrewed my reflections jeff says she it isn t quite like you to talk that way i don t care to hear ed collier ridiculed a man may do ridiculous things but they don t look ridiculous to the girl he does em for that was one man in a hundred he stopped eating just to please me i d be hard hearted and ungrateful if i didn t feel kindly toward him could you do what he did i know says i seeing the point i m condemned i can t help it the brand of the consumer is upon my brow mrs eve settled that business for me when she made the dicker with the snake i fell from the fire into the frying pan i guess i m the champion feaster of the universe i spoke humble and mame mollified herself a little ed collier and i are good friends she said the same as me and you i gave him the same answer i did you no marrying for me i liked to be with ed and talk with him there was something mighty pleasant to me in the thought that here was a man who never used a knife and fork and all for my sake wasn t you in love with him i asks all injudicious wasn t there a deal on for you to become mrs curiosity all of us do it sometimes all of us get jostled out of the line of profitable talk now and then mame put on that little lemon glace smile that runs between ice and sugar and says much too pleasant you re short on credentials for asking that question mr peters suppose you do a forty nine day fast just to give you ground to stand on and then maybe i ll answer it so even after collier was kidnapped out of the way by the revolt of his appetite my own prospects with mame didn t seem to be improved and then business played out in guthrie i had stayed too long there the brazilians i had sold commenced to show signs of wear and the kindler refused to light up right frequent on wet mornings there is always a time in my business when the star of success says move on to the next town i was travelling by wagon at that time so as not to miss any of the small towns so i hitched up a few days later and went down to tell mame good bye i wasn t abandoning the game i intended running over to oklahoma city and work it for a week or two then i was coming back to institute fresh proceedings against mame what do i find at the dugans but mame all conspicuous in a blue travelling dress with her little trunk at the door it seems that sister lottie bell who is a typewriter in terre haute is going to be married next thursday and mame is off for a week s visit to be an accomplice at the ceremony mame is waiting for a freight wagon that is going to take her to oklahoma but i condemns the freight wagon with promptness and scorn and offers to deliver the goods myself ma dugan sees no reason why not as mr freighter wants pay for the job so thirty minutes later mame and i pull out in my light spring wagon with white canvas cover and head due south that morning was of a praiseworthy sort the breeze was lively and smelled excellent of flowers and grass and the little cottontail rabbits entertained themselves with skylarking across the road my two kentucky bays went for the horizon until it come sailing in so fast you wanted to dodge it like a clothesline mame was full of talk and rattled on like a kid about her old home and her school pranks and the things she liked and the hateful ways of those johnson girls just across the street way up in indiana not a word was said about ed collier or victuals or such solemn subjects about noon mame looks and finds that the lunch she had put up in a basket had been left behind i could have managed quite a collation but mame didn t seem to be grieving over nothing to eat so i made no lamentations it was a sore subject with me and i ruled provender in all its branches out of my conversation i am minded to touch light on explanations how i came to lose the way the road was dim and well grown with grass and there was mame by my side confiscating my intellects and attention the excuses are good or they are not as they may appear to you but i lost it and at dusk that afternoon when we should have been in oklahoma city we were seesawing along the edge of nowhere in some undiscovered river bottom and the rain was falling in large wet bunches down there in the swamps we saw a little log house on a small knoll of high ground the bottom grass and the chaparral and the lonesome timber crowded all around it it seemed to be a melancholy little house and you felt sorry for it twas that house for the night the way i reasoned it i explained to mame and she leaves it to me to decide she doesn t become galvanic and prosecuting as most women would but she says it s all right she knows i didn t mean to do it we found the house was deserted it had two empty rooms there was a little shed in the yard where beasts had once been kept in a loft of it was a lot of old hay i put my horses in there and gave them some of it for which they looked at me sorrowful expecting apologies the rest of the hay i carried into the house by armfuls with a view to accommodations i also brought in the patent kindler and the brazilians neither of which are guaranteed against the action of water mame and i sat on the wagon seats on the floor and i lit a lot of the kindler on the hearth for the night was chilly if i was any judge that girl enjoyed it it was a change for her it gave her a different point of view she laughed and talked and the kindler made a dim light compared to her eyes i had a pocketful of cigars and as far as i was concerned there had never been any fall of man we were at the same old stand in the garden of eden out there somewhere in the rain and the dark was the river of zion and the angel with the flaming sword had not yet put up the keep off the grass sign i opened up a gross or two of the brazilians and made mame put them on rings brooches necklaces eardrops bracelets girdles and lockets she flashed and sparkled like a million dollar princess until she had pink spots in her cheeks and almost cried for a looking glass when it got late i made a fine bunk on the floor for mame with the hay and my lap robes and blankets out of the wagon and persuaded her to lie down i sat in the other room burning tobacco and listening to the pouring rain and meditating on the many vicissitudes that came to a man during the seventy years or so immediately preceding his funeral i must have dozed a little while before morning for my eyes were shut and when i opened them it was daylight and there stood mame with her hair all done up neat and correct and her eyes bright with admiration of existence gee whiz jeff she exclaims but i m hungry i could eat a i looked up and caught her eye her smile went back in and she gave me a cold look of suspicion then i laughed and laid down on the floor to laugh easier it seemed funny to me by nature and geniality i am a hearty laugher and i went the limit when i came to mame was sitting with her back to me all contaminated with dignity don t be angry mame i says for i couldn t help it it s the funny way you ve done up your hair if you could only see it you needn t tell stories sir said mame cool and advised my hair is all right i know what you were laughing about why jeff look outside she winds up peeping through a chink between the logs i opened the little wooden window and looked out the entire river bottom was flooded and the knob of land on which the house stood was an island in the middle of a rushing stream of yellow water a hundred yards wide and it was still raining hard all we could do was to stay there till the doves brought in the olive branch i am bound to admit that conversations and amusements languished during that day i was aware that mame was getting a too prolonged one sided view of things again but i had no way to change it personally i was wrapped up in the desire to eat i had hallucinations of hash and visions of ham and i kept saying to myself all the time what ll you have to eat jeff what ll you order now old man when the waiter comes i picks out to myself all sorts of favourites from the bill of fare and imagines them coming i guess it s that way with all hungry men they can t get their cogitations trained on anything but something to eat it shows that the little table with the broken legged caster and the imitation worcester sauce and the napkin covering up the coffee stains is the paramount issue after all instead of the question of immortality or peace between nations i sat there musing along arguing with myself quite heated as to how i d have my steak with mushrooms or a la creole mame was on the other seat pensive her head leaning on her hand let the potatoes come home fried i states in my mind and brown the hash in the pan with nine poached eggs on the side i felt careful in my own pockets to see if i could find a peanut or a grain or two of popcorn night came on again with the river still rising and the rain still falling i looked at mame and i noticed that desperate look on her face that a girl always wears when she passes an ice cream lair i knew that poor girl was hungry maybe for the first time in her life there was that anxious look in her eye that a woman has only when she has missed a meal or feels her skirt coming unfastened in the back it was about eleven o clock or so on the second night when we sat gloomy in our shipwrecked cabin i kept jerking my mind away from the subject of food but it kept flopping back again before i could fasten it i thought of everything good to eat i had ever heard of i went away back to my kidhood and remembered the hot biscuit sopped in sorghum and bacon gravy with partiality and respect then i trailed along up the years pausing at green apples and salt flapjacks and maple lye hominy fried chicken old virginia style corn on the cob spareribs and sweet potato pie and wound up with georgia brunswick stew which is the top notch of good things to eat because it comprises em all they say a drowning man sees a panorama of his whole life pass before him well when a man s starving he sees the ghost of every meal he ever ate set out before him and he invents new dishes that would make the fortune of a chef if somebody would collect the last words of men who starved to death they d have to sift em mighty fine to discover the sentiment but they d compile into a cook book that would sell into the millions i guess i must have had my conscience pretty well inflicted with culinary meditations for without intending to do so i says out loud to the imaginary waiter cut it thick and have it rare with the french fried and six soft scrambled on toast mame turned her head quick as a wing her eyes were sparkling and she smiled sudden medium for me she rattles out with the juliennes and three straight up draw one and brown the wheats double order to come oh jeff wouldn t it be glorious and then i d like to have a half fry and a little chicken curried with rice and a cup custard with ice cream and go easy i interrupts where s the chicken liver pie and the kidney saute on toast and the roast lamb and oh cuts in mame all excited with mint sauce and the turkey salad and stuffed olives and raspberry tarts and keep it going says i hurry up with the fried squash and the hot corn pone with sweet milk and don t forget the apple dumpling with hard sauce and the cross barred dew berry pie yes for ten minutes we kept up that kind of restaurant repartee we ranges up and down and backward and forward over the main trunk lines and the branches of the victual subject and mame leads the game for she is apprised in the ramifications of grub and the dishes she nominates aggravates my yearnings it seems that there is a feeling that mame will line up friendly again with food it seems that she looks upon the obnoxious science of eating with less contempt than before the next morning we find that the flood has subsided i geared up the bays and we splashed out through the mud some precarious until we found the road again we were only a few miles wrong and in two hours we were in oklahoma city the first thing we saw was a big restaurant sign and we piled into there in a hurry here i finds myself sitting with mame at table with knives and forks and plates between us and she not scornful but smiling with starvation and sweetness twas a new restaurant and well stocked i designated a list of quotations from the bill of fare that made the waiter look out toward the wagon to see how many more might be coming there we were and there was the order being served twas a banquet for a dozen but we felt like a dozen i looked across the table at mame and smiled for i had recollections mame was looking at the table like a boy looks at his first stem winder then she looked at me straight in the face and two big tears came in her eyes the waiter was gone after more grub jeff she says soft like i ve been a foolish girl i ve looked at things from the wrong side i never felt this way before men get hungry every day like this don t they they re big and strong and they do the hard work of the world and they don t eat just to spite silly waiter girls in restaurants do they jeff you said once that is you asked me you wanted me to well jeff if you still care i d be glad and willing to have you always sitting across the table from me now give me something to eat quick please so as i ve said a woman needs to change her point of view now and then they get tired of the same old sights the same old dinner table washtub and sewing machine give em a touch of the various a little travel and a little rest a little tomfoolery along with the tragedies of keeping house a little petting after the blowing up a little upsetting and a little jostling around and everybody in the game will have chips added to their stack by the play the caballero s way the cisco kid had killed six men in more or less fair scrimmages had murdered twice as many mostly mexicans and had winged a larger number whom he modestly forbore to count therefore a woman loved him the kid was twenty five looked twenty and a careful insurance company would have estimated the probable time of his demise at say twenty six his habitat was anywhere between the frio and the rio grande he killed for the love of it because he was quick tempered to avoid arrest for his own amusement any reason that came to his mind would suffice he had escaped capture because he could shoot five sixths of a second sooner than any sheriff or ranger in the service and because he rode a speckled roan horse that knew every cow path in the mesquite and pear thickets from san antonio to matamoras tonia perez the girl who loved the cisco kid was half carmen half madonna and the rest oh yes a woman who is half carmen and half madonna can always be something more the rest let us say was humming bird she lived in a grass roofed jacal near a little mexican settlement at the lone wolf crossing of the frio with her lived a father or grandfather a lineal aztec somewhat less than a thousand years old who herded a hundred goats and lived in a continuous drunken dream from drinking mescal back of the jacal a tremendous forest of bristling pear twenty feet high at its worst crowded almost to its door it was along the bewildering maze of this spinous thicket that the speckled roan would bring the kid to see his girl and once clinging like a lizard to the ridge pole high up under the peaked grass roof he had heard tonia with her madonna face and carmen beauty and humming bird soul parley with the sheriff s posse denying knowledge of her man in her soft melange of spanish and english one day the adjutant general of the state who is ex officio commander of the ranger forces wrote some sarcastic lines to captain duval of company x stationed at laredo relative to the serene and undisturbed existence led by murderers and desperadoes in the said captain s territory the captain turned the colour of brick dust under his tan and forwarded the letter after adding a few comments per ranger private bill adamson to ranger lieutenant sandridge camped at a water hole on the nueces with a squad of five men in preservation of law and order lieutenant sandridge turned a beautiful couleur de rose through his ordinary strawberry complexion tucked the letter in his hip pocket and chewed off the ends of his gamboge moustache the next morning he saddled his horse and rode alone to the mexican settlement at the lone wolf crossing of the frio twenty miles away six feet two blond as a viking quiet as a deacon dangerous as a machine gun sandridge moved among the jacales patiently seeking news of the cisco kid far more than the law the mexicans dreaded the cold and certain vengeance of the lone rider that the ranger sought it had been one of the kid s pastimes to shoot mexicans to see them kick if he demanded from them moribund terpsichorean feats simply that he might be entertained what terrible and extreme penalties would be certain to follow should they anger him one and all they lounged with upturned palms and shrugging shoulders filling the air with quien sabes and denials of the kid s acquaintance but there was a man named fink who kept a store at the crossing a man of many nationalities tongues interests and ways of thinking no use to ask them mexicans he said to sandridge they re afraid to tell this hombre they call the kid goodall is his name ain t it he s been in my store once or twice i have an idea you might run across him at but i guess i don t keer to say myself i m two seconds later in pulling a gun than i used to be and the difference is worth thinking about but this kid s got a half mexican girl at the crossing that he comes to see she lives in that jacal a hundred yards down the arroyo at the edge of the pear maybe she no i don t suppose she would but that jacal would be a good place to watch anyway sandridge rode down to the jacal of perez the sun was low and the broad shade of the great pear thicket already covered the grass thatched hut the goats were enclosed for the night in a brush corral near by a few kids walked the top of it nibbling the chaparral leaves the old mexican lay upon a blanket on the grass already in a stupor from his mescal and dreaming perhaps of the nights when he and pizarro touched glasses to their new world fortunes so old his wrinkled face seemed to proclaim him to be and in the door of the jacal stood tonia and lieutenant sandridge sat in his saddle staring at her like a gannet agape at a sailorman the cisco kid was a vain person as all eminent and successful assassins are and his bosom would have been ruffled had he known that at a simple exchange of glances two persons in whose minds he had been looming large suddenly abandoned at least for the time all thought of him never before had tonia seen such a man as this he seemed to be made of sunshine and blood red tissue and clear weather he seemed to illuminate the shadow of the pear when he smiled as though the sun were rising again the men she had known had been small and dark even the kid in spite of his achievements was a stripling no larger than herself with black straight hair and a cold marble face that chilled the noonday as for tonia though she sends description to the poorhouse let her make a millionaire of your fancy her blue black hair smoothly divided in the middle and bound close to her head and her large eyes full of the latin melancholy gave her the madonna touch her motions and air spoke of the concealed fire and the desire to charm that she had inherited from the gitanas of the basque province as for the humming bird part of her that dwelt in her heart you could not perceive it unless her bright red skirt and dark blue blouse gave you a symbolic hint of the vagarious bird the newly lighted sun god asked for a drink of water tonia brought it from the red jar hanging under the brush shelter sandridge considered it necessary to dismount so as to lessen the trouble of her ministrations i play no spy nor do i assume to master the thoughts of any human heart but i assert by the chronicler s right that before a quarter of an hour had sped sandridge was teaching her how to plaint a six strand rawhide stake rope and tonia had explained to him that were it not for her little english book that the peripatetic padre had given her and the little crippled chivo that she fed from a bottle she would be very very lonely indeed which leads to a suspicion that the kid s fences needed repairing and that the adjutant general s sarcasm had fallen upon unproductive soil in his camp by the water hole lieutenant sandridge announced and reiterated his intention of either causing the cisco kid to nibble the black loam of the frio country prairies or of haling him before a judge and jury that sounded business like twice a week he rode over to the lone wolf crossing of the frio and directed tonia s slim slightly lemon tinted fingers among the intricacies of the slowly growing lariata a six strand plait is hard to learn and easy to teach the ranger knew that he might find the kid there at any visit he kept his armament ready and had a frequent eye for the pear thicket at the rear of the jacal thus he might bring down the kite and the humming bird with one stone while the sunny haired ornithologist was pursuing his studies the cisco kid was also attending to his professional duties he moodily shot up a saloon in a small cow village on quintana creek killed the town marshal plugging him neatly in the centre of his tin badge and then rode away morose and unsatisfied no true artist is uplifted by shooting an aged man carrying an old style bulldog on his way the kid suddenly experienced the yearning that all men feel when wrong doing loses its keen edge of delight he yearned for the woman he loved to reassure him that she was his in spite of it he wanted her to call his bloodthirstiness bravery and his cruelty devotion he wanted tonia to bring him water from the red jar under the brush shelter and tell him how the chivo was thriving on the bottle the kid turned the speckled roan s head up the ten mile pear flat that stretches along the arroyo hondo until it ends at the lone wolf crossing of the frio the roan whickered for he had a sense of locality and direction equal to that of a belt line street car horse and he knew he would soon be nibbling the rich mesquite grass at the end of a forty foot stake rope while ulysses rested his head in circe s straw roofed hut more weird and lonesome than the journey of an amazonian explorer is the ride of one through a texas pear flat with dismal monotony and startling variety the uncanny and multiform shapes of the cacti lift their twisted trunks and fat bristly hands to encumber the way the demon plant appearing to live without soil or rain seems to taunt the parched traveller with its lush grey greenness it warps itself a thousand times about what look to be open and inviting paths only to lure the rider into blind and impassable spine defended bottoms of the bag leaving him to retreat if he can with the points of the compass whirling in his head to be lost in the pear is to die almost the death of the thief on the cross pierced by nails and with grotesque shapes of all the fiends hovering about but it was not so with the kid and his mount winding twisting circling tracing the most fantastic and bewildering trail ever picked out the good roan lessened the distance to the lone wolf crossing with every coil and turn that he made while they fared the kid sang he knew but one tune and sang it as he knew but one code and lived it and but one girl and loved her he was a single minded man of conventional ideas he had a voice like a coyote with bronchitis but whenever he chose to sing his song he sang it it was a conventional song of the camps and trail running at its beginning as near as may be to these words don t you monkey with my lulu girl or i ll tell you what i ll do and so on the roan was inured to it and did not mind but even the poorest singer will after a certain time gain his own consent to refrain from contributing to the world s noises so the kid by the time he was within a mile or two of tonia s jacal had reluctantly allowed his song to die away not because his vocal performance had become less charming to his own ears but because his laryngeal muscles were aweary as though he were in a circus ring the speckled roan wheeled and danced through the labyrinth of pear until at length his rider knew by certain landmarks that the lone wolf crossing was close at hand then where the pear was thinner he caught sight of the grass roof of the jacal and the hackberry tree on the edge of the arroyo a few yards farther the kid stopped the roan and gazed intently through the prickly openings then he dismounted dropped the roan s reins and proceeded on foot stooping and silent like an indian the roan knowing his part stood still making no sound the kid crept noiselessly to the very edge of the pear thicket and reconnoitred between the leaves of a clump of cactus ten yards from his hiding place in the shade of the jacal sat his tonia calmly plaiting a rawhide lariat so far she might surely escape condemnation women have been known from time to time to engage in more mischievous occupations but if all must be told there is to be added that her head reposed against the broad and comfortable chest of a tall red and yellow man and that his arm was about her guiding her nimble fingers that required so many lessons at the intricate six strand plait sandridge glanced quickly at the dark mass of pear when he heard a slight squeaking sound that was not altogether unfamiliar a gun scabbard will make that sound when one grasps the handle of a six shooter suddenly but the sound was not repeated and tonia s fingers needed close attention and then in the shadow of death they began to talk of their love and in the still july afternoon every word they uttered reached the ears of the kid remember then said tonia you must not come again until i send for you soon he will be here a vaquero at the tienda said to day he saw him on the guadalupe three days ago when he is that near he always comes if he comes and finds you here he will kill you so for my sake you must come no more until i send you the word all right said the stranger and then what and then said the girl you must bring your men here and kill him if not he will kill you he ain t a man to surrender that s sure said sandridge it s kill or be killed for the officer that goes up against mr cisco kid he must die said the girl otherwise there will not be any peace in the world for thee and me he has killed many let him so die bring your men and give him no chance to escape you used to think right much of him said sandridge tonia dropped the lariat twisted herself around and curved a lemon tinted arm over the ranger s shoulder but then she murmured in liquid spanish i had not beheld thee thou great red mountain of a man and thou art kind and good as well as strong could one choose him knowing thee let him die for then i will not be filled with fear by day and night lest he hurt thee or me how can i know when he comes asked sandridge when he comes said tonia he remains two days sometimes three gregorio the small son of old luisa the lavendera has a swift pony i will write a letter to thee and send it by him saying how it will be best to come upon him by gregorio will the letter come and bring many men with thee and have much care oh dear red one for the rattlesnake is not quicker to strike than is el chivato as they call him to send a ball from his pistola the kid s handy with his gun sure enough admitted sandridge but when i come for him i shall come alone i ll get him by myself or not at all the cap wrote one or two things to me that make me want to do the trick without any help you let me know when mr kid arrives and i ll do the rest i will send you the message by the boy gregorio said the girl i knew you were braver than that small slayer of men who never smiles how could i ever have thought i cared for him it was time for the ranger to ride back to his camp on the water hole before he mounted his horse he raised the slight form of tonia with one arm high from the earth for a parting salute the drowsy stillness of the torpid summer air still lay thick upon the dreaming afternoon the smoke from the fire in the jacal where the frijoles blubbered in the iron pot rose straight as a plumb line above the clay daubed chimney no sound or movement disturbed the serenity of the dense pear thicket ten yards away when the form of sandridge had disappeared loping his big dun down the steep banks of the frio crossing the kid crept back to his own horse mounted him and rode back along the tortuous trail he had come but not

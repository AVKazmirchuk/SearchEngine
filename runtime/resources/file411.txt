to be intimidated by that married man according to perry s idea checkers was the event of the day but if i am any judge of gentle recreations that little table leg parade through the gray mule saloon deserved the head lines in the bill of particulars walk fast says perry it s two minutes to seven and i got to be home by oh shut up says i i had an appointment as chief performer at an inquest at seven and i m not kicking about not keeping it i had to pass by perry s little house his mariana was standing at the gate we got there at five minutes past seven she had on a blue wrapper and her hair was pulled back smooth like little girls do when they want to look grown folksy she didn t see us till we got close for she was gazing up the other way then she backed around and saw perry and a kind of a look scooted around over her face danged if i can describe it i heard her breathe long just like a cow when you turn her calf in the lot and she says you re late perry five minutes says perry cheerful me and old buck was having a game of checkers perry introduces me to mariana and they ask me to come in no sir ee i d had enough truck with married folks for that day i says i ll be going along and that i ve spent a very pleasant afternoon with my old partner especially says i just to jostle perry during that game when the table legs came all loose but i d promised him not to let her know anything i ve been worrying over that business ever since it happened continued buck there s one thing about it that s got me all twisted up and i can t figure it out what was that i asked as i rolled and handed buck the last cigarette why i ll tell you when i saw the look that little woman gave perry when she turned round and saw him coming back to the ranch safe why was it i got the idea all in a minute that that look of hers was worth more than the whole caboodle of us sarsaparilla checkers and all and that the d n fool in the game wasn t named perry rountree at all rolling stones

of the rolling stone with a circulation greatly in excess of that of the only two numbers that had gone before apparently the business office was encouraged the first two issues of one thousand copies each had been bought up of the third an edition of six thousand was published and distributed free so that the business men of austin texas might know what a good medium was at hand for their advertising the editor and proprietor and illustrator of the rolling stone was will porter incidentally paying and receiving teller in major brackenridge s bank perhaps the most characteristic feature of the paper was the plunkville patriot a page each week or at least with the regularity of the somewhat uncertain paper itself purporting to be reprinted from a contemporary journal the editor of the plunkville patriot was colonel aristotle jordan unrelenting enemy of his enemies when the colonel s application for the postmastership in plunkville is ignored his columns carry a bitter attack on the administration at washington with the public weal at heart the patriot announces that there is a dangerous hole in the front steps of the elite saloon here too appears the delightful literary item

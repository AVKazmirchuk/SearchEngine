afterward developed with a surer hand in the pendulum find yo shirt all right sam asked mrs webber from her chair under the live oak where she was comfortably seated with a paper back volume for company it balances perfeckly marthy answered sam with a suspicious pleasantness in his tone at first i was about ter be a little reckless and kick cause ther buttons was all off but since i diskiver that the button holes is all busted out why i wouldn t go so fur as to say the buttons is any loss to speak of oh well said his wife carelessly put on your necktie that ll keep it together sam webber s sheep ranch was situated in the loneliest part of the country between the nueces and the frio the ranch house a two room box structure was on the rise of a gently swelling hill in the midst of a wilderness of high chaparral in front of it was a small clearing where stood the sheep pens shearing shed and wool house only a few feet back of it began the thorny jungle sam was going to ride over to the chapman ranch to see about buying some more improved merino rams at length he came out ready for his ride this being a business trip of some importance and the chapman ranch being almost a small town in population and size sam had decided to dress up accordingly the result was that he had transformed himself from a graceful picturesque frontiersman into something much less pleasing to the sight the tight white collar awkwardly constricted his muscular mahogany colored neck the buttonless shirt bulged in stiff waves beneath his unbuttoned vest the suit of ready made effectually concealed the fine lines of his straight athletic figure his berry brown face was set to the melancholy dignity befitting a prisoner of state he gave randy his three year old son a pat on the head and hurried out to where mexico his favorite saddle horse was standing marthy leisurely rocking in her chair fixed her place in the book with her finger and turned her head smiling mischievously as she noted the havoc sam had wrought with his appearance in trying to fix up well ef i must say it sam she drawled you look jest like one of them hayseeds in the picture papers stead of a free and

oh go on sam and leave me in peace sam gave his pony a squeeze with his knees and shoved down the wagon trail that connected his ranch with the old open government road it was eight o clock and already beginning to be very warm he should have started three hours earlier chapman ranch was only eighteen miles away but there was a road for only three miles of the distance he had ridden over there once with one of the half moon cowpunchers and he had the direction well defined in his mind sam turned off the old government road at the split mesquite and struck down the arroyo of the quintanilla here was a narrow stretch of smiling valley upholstered with a rich mat of green curly mesquite grass and mexico consumed those few miles quickly with his long easy lope again upon reaching wild duck waterhole must he abandon well defined ways he turned now to his right up a little hill pebble covered upon which grew only the tenacious and thorny prickly pear and chaparral at the summit of this he paused to take his last general view of the landscape for from now on he must wind through brakes and thickets of chaparral pear and mesquite for the most part seeing scarcely farther than twenty yards in any direction choosing his way by the prairie dweller

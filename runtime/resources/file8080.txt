sitting room i m mighty sorry daughter that you didn t get your hat said her mother oh don t worry mother said tonia coolly i ll have a new hat all right in time to morrow when burrows reached the end of the strip of prairie he pulled his sorrel to the right and let him pick his way daintily across a sacuista flat through which ran the ragged dry bed of an arroyo then up a gravelly hill matted with bush the hoarse scrambled and at length emerged with a snort of satisfaction into a stretch of high level prairie grassy and dotted with the lighter green of mesquites in their fresh spring foliage always to the right burrows bore until in a little while he struck the old indian trail that followed the nueces southward and that passed twenty eight miles to the southeast through lone elm here burrows urged the sorrel into a steady lope as he settled himself in the saddle for a long ride he heard the drumming of hoofs the hollow thwack of chaparral against wooden stirrups the whoop of a comanche and wells pearson burst out of the brush at the right of the trail like a precocious yellow chick from a dark green easter egg except in the presence of awing femininity melancholy found no place in pearson s bosom in tonia s presence his voice was as soft as a summer bullfrog s in his reedy nest now at his gleesome yawp rabbits a mile away ducked their ears and sensitive plants closed their fearful fronds moved your lambing camp pretty far from the ranch haven t you neighbor asked pearson as road runner fell in at the sorrel s side twenty eight miles said burrows looking a little grim pearson s laugh woke an owl one hour too early in his water elm on the river bank half a mile away all right for you sheepman i like an open game myself we re two locoed he milliners hat hunting in the wilderness i notify you burr to mind your corrals we ve got an even start and the one that gets the headgear will stand some higher at the espinosa you ve got a good pony said burrows eyeing road runner s barrel like body and tapering legs that moved as regularly as the pistonrod of an engine it s a race of course but you re too much of a horseman to whoop it up this soon say we travel together till we get to the home stretch i m your company agreed pearson and i admire your sense if there s hats at lone elm one of em shall set on miss tonia s brow to morrow and you won t be at the crowning i ain t bragging burr but that sorrel of yours is weak in the fore legs my horse against yours offered burrows that miss tonia wears the hat i take her to cactus to morrow i ll take you up shouted pearson but oh it s just like horse stealing for me i can use that sorrel for a lady s animal when when somebody comes over to mucho calor and burrows dark face glowered so suddenly that the cowman broke off his sentence but pearson could never feel any pressure for long what s all this easter business about burr he asked cheerfully why do the women folks have to have new hats by the almanac or bust all cinches trying to get em it s a seasonable statute out of the testaments explained burrows it s ordered by the pope or somebody and it has something to do with the zodiac i don t know exactly but i think it was invented by the egyptians it s an all right jubilee if the heathens did put their brand on it said pearson or else tonia wouldn t have anything to do with it and they pull it off at church too suppose there ain t but one hat in the lone elm store burr then said burrows darkly the best man of us ll take it back to the espinosa oh man cried pearson throwing his hat high and catching it again there s nothing like you come off the sheep ranges before you talk good and collateral to the occasion and if there s more than one then said burrows we ll pick our choice and one of us ll get back first with his and the other won t there never was two souls proclaimed pearson to the stars that beat more like one heart than yourn and mine me and you might be riding on a unicorn and thinking out of the same piece of mind at a little past midnight the riders loped into lone elm the half a hundred houses of the big village were dark on its only street the big wooden store stood barred and shuttered in a few moments the horses were fastened and pearson was pounding cheerfully on the door of old sutton the storekeeper the barrel of a winchester came through a cranny of a solid window shutter followed by a short inquiry wells pearson of the mucho calor and burrows of green valley was the response we want to buy some goods in the store sorry to wake you up but we must have em come on out vncle tommy and get a move on you uncle tommy was slow but at length they got him behind his counter with a kerosene lamp lit and told him of their dire need easter hats said uncle tommy sleepily why yes i believe i have got just a couple left i only ordered a dozen this spring i ll show em to you now uncle tommy sutton was a merchant half asleep or awake in dusty pasteboard boxes under the counter he had two left over spring hats but alas for his commercial probity on that early saturday morn they were hats of two springs ago and a woman s eye would have detected the fraud at half a glance but to the unintelligent gaze of the cowpuncher and the sheepman they seemed fresh from the mint of contemporaneous april the hats were of a variety once known as cart wheels they were of stiff straw colored red and flat brimmed both were exactly alike and trimmed lavishly around their crowns with full blown immaculate artificial white roses that all you got uncle tommy said pearson all right not much choice here burr take your pick they re the latest styles lied uncle tommy you d see em on fifth avenue if you was in new york uncle tommy wrapped and tied each hat in two yards of dark calico for a protection one pearson tied carefully to his calfskin saddle thongs and the other became part of road runner s burden they shouted thanks and farewells to uncle tommy and cantered back into the night on the home stretch the horsemen jockeyed with all their skill they rode more slowly on their way back the few words they spoke were not unfriendly burrows had a winchester under his left leg slung over his saddle horn pearson had a six shooter belted around him thus men rode in the frio country at half past seven in the morning they rode to the top of a hill and saw the espinosa ranch a white spot under a dark patch of live oaks five miles away the sight roused pearson from his drooping pose in the saddle he knew what road runner could do the sorrel was lathered and stumbling frequently road runner was pegging away like a donkey engine pearson turned toward the sheepman and laughed good bye burr he cried with a wave of his hand it s a race now we re on the home stretch he pressed road runner with his knees and leaned toward the espinosa road runner struck into a gallop with tossing head and snorting nostrils as if he were fresh from a month in pasture pearson rode twenty yards and heard the unmistakable sound of a winchester lever throwing a cartridge into the barrel he dropped flat along his horse s back before the crack of the rifle reached his ears it is possible that burrows intended only to disable the horse he was a good enough shot to do that without endangering his rider but as pearson stooped the ball went through his shoulder and then through road runner s neck the horse fell and the cowman pitched over his head into the hard road and neither of them tried to move burrows rode on without stopping in two hours pearson opened his eyes and took inventory he managed to get to his feet and staggered back to where road runner was lying road runner was lying there but he appeared to be comfortable pearson examined him and found that the bullet had creased him he had been knocked out temporarily but not seriously hurt but he was tired and he lay there on miss tonia s hat and ate leaves from a mesquite branch that obligingly hung over the road pearson made the horse get up the easter hat loosed from the saddle thongs lay there in its calico wrappings a shapeless thing from its sojourn beneath the solid carcass of road runner then pearson fainted and fell head long upon the poor hat again crumpling it under his wounded shoulders it is hard to kill a cowpuncher in half an hour he revived long enough for a woman to have fainted twice and tried ice cream for a restorer he got up carefully and found road runner who was busy with the near by grass he tied the unfortunate hat to the saddle again and managed to get himself there too after many failures at noon a gay and fluttering company waited in front of the espinosa ranch the rogers girls were there in their new buckboard and the anchor o outfit and the green valley folks mostly women and each and every one wore her new easter hat even upon the lonely prairies for they greatly desired to shine forth and do honor to the coming festival at the gate stood tonia with undisguised tears upon her cheeks in her hand she held burrow s lone elm hat and it was at its white roses hated by her that she wept for her friends were telling her with the ecstatic joy of true friends that cart wheels could not be worn being three seasons passed into oblivion put on your old hat and come tonia they urged for easter sunday she answered i ll die first and wept again the hats of the fortunate ones were curved and twisted into the style of spring s latest proclamation a strange being rode out of the brush among them and there sat his horse languidly he was stained and disfigured with the green of the grass and the limestone of rocky roads hallo pearson said daddy weaver look like you ve been breaking a mustang what s that you ve got tied to your saddle a pig in a poke oh come on tonia if you re going said betty rogers we mustn t wait any longer we ve saved a seat in the buckboard for you never mind the hat that lovely muslin you ve got on looks sweet enough with any old hat pearson was slowly untying the queer thing on his saddle tonia looked at him with a sudden hope pearson was a man who created hope he got the thing loose and handed it to her her quick fingers tore at the strings best i could do said pearson slowly what road runner and me done to it will be about all it needs oh oh it s just the right shape shrieked tonia and red roses wait till i try it on she flew in to the glass and out again beaming radiating blossomed oh don t red become her chanted the girls in recitative hurry up tonia tonia stopped for a moment by the side of road runner thank you thank you wells she said happily it s just what i wanted won t you come over to cactus to morrow and go to church with me if i can said pearson he was looking curiously at her hat and then he grinned weakly tonia flew into the buckboard like a bird the vehicles sped away for cactus what have you been doing pearson asked daddy weaver you ain t looking so well as common me said pearson i ve been painting flowers them roses was white when i left lone elm help me down daddy weaver for i haven t got any more paint to spare round the circle this story is especially interesting as an early treatment of the theme afterward developed with a surer hand in the pendulum find yo shirt all right sam asked mrs webber from her chair under the live oak where she was comfortably seated with a paper back volume for company it balances perfeckly marthy answered sam with a suspicious pleasantness in his tone at first i was about ter be a little reckless and kick cause ther buttons was all off but since i diskiver that the button holes is all busted out why i wouldn t go so fur as to say the buttons is any loss to speak of oh well said his wife carelessly put on your necktie that ll keep it together sam webber s sheep ranch was situated in the loneliest part of the country between the nueces and the frio the ranch house a two room box structure was on the rise of a gently swelling hill in the midst of a wilderness of high chaparral in front of it was a small clearing where stood the sheep pens shearing shed and wool house only a few feet back of it began the thorny jungle sam was going to ride over to the chapman ranch to see about buying some more improved merino rams at length he came out ready for his ride this being a business trip of some importance and the chapman ranch being almost a small town in population and size sam had decided to dress up accordingly the result was that he had transformed himself from a graceful picturesque frontiersman into something much less pleasing to the sight the tight white collar awkwardly constricted his muscular mahogany colored neck the buttonless shirt bulged in stiff waves beneath his unbuttoned vest the suit of ready made effectually concealed the fine lines of his straight athletic figure his berry brown face was set to the melancholy dignity befitting a prisoner of state he gave randy his three year old son a pat on the head and hurried out to where mexico his favorite saddle horse was standing marthy leisurely rocking in her chair fixed her place in the book with her finger and turned her head smiling mischievously as she noted the havoc sam had wrought with his appearance in trying to fix up well ef i must say it sam she drawled you look jest like one of them hayseeds in the picture papers stead of a free and independent sheepman of the state o texas sam climbed awkwardly into the saddle you re the one ought to be shamed to say so he replied hotly stead of tendin to a man s clothes you re al ays setting around a readin them billy by dam yaller back novils oh shet up and ride along said mrs webber with a little jerk at the handles of her chair you always fussin bout my readin i do a plenty and i ll read when i wanter i live in the bresh here like a varmint never seein nor hearin nothin and what other musement kin i have not in listenin to you talk for it s complain complain one day after another oh go on sam and leave me in peace sam gave his pony a squeeze with his knees and shoved down the wagon trail that connected his ranch with the old open government road it was eight o clock and already beginning to be very warm he should have started three hours earlier chapman ranch was only eighteen miles away but there was a road for only three miles of the distance he had ridden over there once with one of the half moon cowpunchers and he had the direction well defined in his mind sam turned off the old government road at the split mesquite and struck down the arroyo of the quintanilla here was a narrow stretch of smiling valley upholstered with a rich mat of green curly mesquite grass and mexico consumed those few miles quickly with his long easy lope again upon reaching wild duck waterhole must he abandon well defined ways he turned now to his right up a little hill pebble covered upon which grew only the tenacious and thorny prickly pear and chaparral at the summit of this he paused to take his last general view of the landscape for from now on he must wind through brakes and thickets of chaparral pear and mesquite for the most part seeing scarcely farther than twenty yards in any direction choosing his way by the prairie dweller s instinct guided only by an occasional glimpse of a far distant hilltop a peculiarly shaped knot of trees or the position of the sun sam rode down the sloping hill and plunged into the great pear flat that lies between the quintanilla and the piedra in about two hours he discovered that he was lost then came the usual confusion of mind and the hurry to get somewhere mexico was anxious to redeem the situation twisting with alacrity along the tortuous labyrinths of the jungle at the moment his master s sureness of the route had failed his horse had divined the fact there were no hills now that they could climb to obtain a view of the country they came upon a few but so dense and interlaced was the brush that scarcely could a rabbit penetrate the mass they were in the great lonely thicket of the frio bottoms it was a mere nothing for a cattleman or a sheepman to be lost for a day or a night the thing often happened it was merely a matter of missing a meal or two and sleeping comfortably on your saddle blankets on a soft mattress of mesquite grass but in sam s case it was different he had never been away from his ranch at night marthy was afraid of the country afraid of mexicans of snakes of panthers even of sheep so he had never left her alone it must have been about four in the afternoon when sam s conscience awoke he was limp and drenched rather from anxiety than the heat or fatigue until now he had been hoping to strike the trail that led to the frio crossing and the chapman ranch he must have crossed it at some dim part of it and ridden beyond if so he was now something like fifty miles from home if he could strike a ranch a camp any place where he could get a fresh horse and inquire the road he would ride all night to get back to marthy and the kid so i have hinted sam was seized bv remorse there was a big lump in his throat as he thought of the cross words he had spoken to his wife surely it was hard enough for her to live in that horrible country witnout having to bear the burden of his abuse he cursed himself grimly and felt a sudden flush of shame that over glowed the summer heat as he remembered the many times he had flouted and railed at her because she had a liking for reading fiction ther only so ce ov amusement ther po gal s got said sam aloud with a sob which unaccustomed sound caused mexico to shy a bit a livin with a sore headed kiote like me a low down skunk that ought to be licked to death with a saddle cinch a cookin and a washin and a livin on mutton and beans and me abusin her fur takin a squint or two in a little book he thought of marthy as she had been when he first met her in dogtown smart pretty and saucy before the sun had turned the roses in her cheeks brown and the silence of the chaparral had tamed her ambitions ef i ever speaks another hard word to ther little gal muttered sam or fails in the love and affection that s coming to her in the deal i hopes a wildcat ll t ar me to pieces he knew what he would do he would write to garcia jones his san antonio merchants where he bought his supplies and sold his wool and have them send down a big box of novels and reading matter for marthy things were going to be different he wondered whether a little piano could be placed in one of the rooms of the ranch house without the family having to move out of doors in nowise calculated to allay his self reproach was the thought that marthy and randy would have to pass the night alone in spite of their bickerings when night came marthy was wont to dismiss her fears of the country and rest her head upon sam s strong arm with a sigh of peaceful content and dependence and were her fears so groundless sam thought of roving marauding mexicans of stealthy cougars that sometimes invaded the ranches of rattlesnakes centipedes and a dozen possible dangers marthy would be frantic with fear randy would cry and call for dada to come still the interminable succession of stretches of brush cactus and mesquite hollow after hollow slope after slope all exactly alike all familiar by constant repetition and yet all strange and new if he could only arrive somewhere the straight line is art nature moves in circles a straightforward man is more an artificial product than a diplomatist is men lost in the snow travel in exact circles until they sink exhausted as their footprints have attested also travellers in philosophy and other mental processes frequently wind up at their starting point it was when sam webber was fullest of contrition and good resolves that mexico with a heavy sigh subsided from his regular brisk trot into a slow complacent walk they were winding up an easy slope covered with brush ten or twelve feet high i say now mex demurred sam this here won t do i know you re plumb tired out but we got ter git along oh lordy ain t there no mo houses in the world he gave mexico a smart kick with his heels mexico gave a protesting grunt as if to say what s the use of that now we re so near he quickened his gait into a languid trot rounding a great clump of black chaparral he stopped short sam dropped the bridle reins and sat looking into the back door of his own house not ten yards away marthy serene and comfortable sat in her rocking chair before the door in the shade of the house with her feet resting luxuriously upon the steps randy who was playing with a pair of spurs on the ground looked up for a moment at his father and went on spinning the rowels and singing a little song marthy turned her head lazily against the back of the chair and considered the arrivals with emotionless eyes she held a book in her lap with her finger holding the place sam shook himself queerly like a man coming out of a dream and slowly dismounted he moistened his dry lips i see you are still a settin he said a readin of them billy by dam yaller back novils sam had traveled round the circle and was himself again the rubber plant s story we rubber plants form the connecting link between the vegetable kingdom and the decorations of a waldorf astoria scene in a third avenue theatre i haven t looked up our family tree but i believe we were raised by grafting a gum overshoe on to a cent table d hote stalk of asparagus you take a white bulldog with a bourke cockran air of independence about him and a rubber plant and there you have the fauna and flora of a flat what the shamrock is to ireland the rubber plant is to the dweller in flats and furnished rooms we get moved from one place to another so quickly that the only way we can get our picture taken is with a kinetoscope we are the vagrant vine and the flitting fig tree you know the proverb where the rubber plant sits in the window the moving van draws up to the door we are the city equivalent to the woodbine and the honeysuckle no other vegetable except the pittsburg stogie can withstand as much handling as we can when the family to which we belong moves into a flat they set us in the front window and we become lares and penates fly paper and the peripatetic emblem of home sweet home we aren t as green as we look i guess we are about what you would call the soubrettes of the conservatory you try sitting in the front window of a flat in manhattan and looking out into the street all day and back into the flat at night and see whether you get wise or not hey talk about the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden of eden say suppose there had been a rubber plant there when eve but i was going to tell you a story the first thing i can remember i had only three leaves and belonged to a member of the pony ballet i was kept in a sunny window and was generally watered with seltzer and lemon i had plenty of fun in those days i got cross eyed trying to watch the numbers of the automobiles in the street and the dates on the labels inside at the same time well then the angel that was molting for the musical comedy lost his last feather and the company broke up the ponies trotted away and i was left in the window ownerless the janitor gave me to a refined comedy team on the eighth floor and in six weeks i had been set in the window of five different flats i took on experience and put out two more leaves miss carruthers of the refined comedy team did you ever see her cross both feet back of her neck gave me to a friend of hers who had made an unfortunate marriage with a man in a store consequently i was placed in the window of a furnished room rent in advance water two flights up gas extra after ten o clock at night two of my leaves withered off here also i was moved from one room to another so many times that i got to liking the odor of the pipes the expressmen smoked i don t think i ever had so dull a time as i did with this lady there was never anything amusing going on inside she was devoted to her husband and besides leaning out the window and flirting with the iceman she never did a thing toward breaking the monotony when the couple broke up they left me with the rest of their goods at a second hand store i was put out in front for sale along with the jobbiest lot you ever heard of being lumped into one bargain think of this little cornucopia of wonders all for henry james s works six talking machine records one pair of tennis shoes two bottles of horse radish and a rubber plant that was me one afternoon a girl came along and stopped to look at me she had dark hair and eyes and she looked slim and sad around the mouth oh oh she says to herself i never thought to see one up here she pulls out a little purse about as thick as one of my leaves and fingers over some small silver in it old koen always on the lockout is ready rubbing his hands this girl proceeds to turn down mr james and the other commodities rubber plants or nothing is the burden of her song and at last koen and she come together at cents and away she goes with me in her arms she was a nice girl but not my style too quiet and sober looking thinks i to myself i ll just about land on the fire escape of a tenement six stories up and i ll spend the next six months looking at clothes on the line but she carried me to a nice little room only three flights up in quite a decent street and she put me in the window of course and then she went to work and cooked dinner for herself and what do you suppose she had bread and tea and a little dab of jam nothing else not a single lobster nor so much as one bottle of champagne the carruthers comedy team had both every evening except now and then when they took a notion for pig s knuckle and kraut after she had finished her dinner my new owner came to the window and leaned down close to my leaves and cried softly to herself for a while it made me feel funny i never knew anybody to cry that way over a rubber plant before of course i ve seen a few of em turn on the tears for what they could get out of it but she seemed to be crying just for the pure enjoyment of it she touched my leaves like she loved em and she bent down her head and kissed each one of em i guess i m about the toughest specimen of a peripatetic orchid on earth but i tell you it made me feel sort of queer home never was like that to me before generally i used to get chewed by poodles and have shirt waists hung on me to dry and get watered with coffee grounds and peroxide of hydrogen this girl had a piano in the room and she used to disturb it with both hands while she made noises with her mouth for hours at a time i suppose she was practising vocal music one day she seemed very much excited and kept looking at the clock at eleven somebody knocked and she let in a stout dark man with towsled black hair he sat down at once at the piano and played while she sang for him when she finished she laid one hand on her bosom and looked at him he shook his head and she leaned against the piano two years already she said speaking slowly do you think in two more or even longer the man shook his head again you waste your time he said roughly i thought the voice is not there and then he looked at her in a peculiar way but the voice is not everything he went on you have looks i can place you as i told you if the girl pointed to the door without saying anything and the dark man left the room and then she came over and cried around me again it s a good thing i had enough rubber in me to be water proof about that time somebody else knocked at the door thank goodness i said to myself here s a chance to get the water works turned off i hope it s somebody that s game enough to stand a bird and a bottle to liven things up a little tell you the truth this little girl made me tired a rubber plant likes to see a little sport now and then i don t suppose there s another green thing in new york that sees as much of gay life unless it s the chartreuse or the sprigs of parsley around the dish when the girl opens the door in steps a young chap in a traveling cap and picks her up in his arms and she sings out oh dick and stays there long enough to well you ve been a rubber plant too sometimes i suppose good thing says i to myself this is livelier than scales and weeping now there ll be something doing you ve got to go back with me says the young man i ve come two thousand miles for you aren t you tired of it yet bess you ve kept all of us waiting so long haven t you found out yet what is best the bubble burst only to day says the girl come here dick and see what i found the other day on the sidewalk for sale she brings him by the hand and exhibits yours truly how one ever got away up here who can tell i bought it with almost the last money i had he looked at me but he couldn t keep his eyes off her for more than a second do you remember the night bess he said when we stood under one of those on the bank of the bayou and what you told me then geewillikins i said to myself both of them stand under a rubber plant seems to me they are stretching matters somewhat do i not says she looking up at him and sneaking close to his vest and now i say it again and it is to last forever look dick at its leaves how wet they are those are my tears and it was thinking of you that made them fall the dear old magnolias says the young man pinching one of my leaves i love them all magnolia well wouldn t that say those innocents thought i was a magnolia what the well wasn t that tough on a genuine little old new york rubber plant out of nazareth okochee in georgia had a boom and j pinkney bloom came out of it with a wad okochee came out of it with a half million dollar debt a two and a half per cent city property tax and a city council that showed a propensity for traveling the back streets of the town these things came about through a fatal resemblance of the river cooloosa to the hudson as set forth and expounded by a northern tourist okochee felt that new york should not be allowed to consider itself the only alligator in the swamp so to speak and then that harmless but persistent individual so numerous in the south the man who is always clamoring for more cotton mills and is ready to take a dollar s worth of stock provided he can borrow the dollar that man added his deadly work to the tourist s innocent praise and okochee fell the cooloosa river winds through a range of small mountains passes okochee and then blends its waters trippingly as fall the mellifluous indian syllables with the chattahoochee okochee rose as it were from its sunny seat on the post office stoop hitched up its suspender and threw a granite dam two hundred and forty feet long and sixty feet high across the cooloosa one mile above the town thereupon a dimpling sparkling lake backed up twenty miles among the little mountains thus in the great game of municipal rivalry did okochee match that famous drawing card the hudson it was conceded that nowhere could the palisades be judged superior in the way of scenery and grandeur following the picture card was played the ace of commercial importance fourteen thousand horsepower would this dam furnish cotton mills factories and manufacturing plants would rise up as the green corn after a shower the spindle and the flywheel and turbine would sing the shrewd glory of okochee along the picturesque heights above the lake would rise in beauty the costly villas and the splendid summer residences of capital the naphtha launch of the millionaire would spit among the romantic coves the verdured hills would take formal shapes of terrace lawn and park money would be spent like water in okochee and water would be turned into money the fate of the good town is quickly told capital decided not to invest of all the great things promised the scenery alone came to fulfilment the wooded peaks the impressive promontories of solemn granite the beautiful green slants of bank and ravine did all they could to reconcile okochee to the delinquency of miserly gold the sunsets gilded the dreamy draws and coves with a minting that should charm away heart burning okochee true to the instinct of its blood and clime was lulled by the spell it climbed out of the arena loosed its suspender sat down again on the post office stoop and took a chew it consoled itself by drawling sarcasms at the city council which was not to blame causing the fathers as has been said to seek back streets and figure perspiringly on the sinking fund and the appropriation for interest due the youth of okochee they who were to carry into the rosy future the burden of the debt accepted failure with youth s uncalculating joy for here was sport aquatic and nautical added to the meagre round of life s pleasures in yachting caps and flowing neckties they pervaded the lake to its limits girls wore silk waists embroidered with anchors in blue and pink the trousers of the young men widened at the bottom and their hands were proudly calloused by the oft plied oar fishermen were under the spell of a deep and tolerant jjoy sailboats and rowboats furrowed the lenient waves popcorn and ice cream booths sprang up about the little wooden pier two small excursion steamboats were built and plied the delectable waters okochee philosophically gave up the hope of eating turtle soup with a gold spoon and settled back not ill content to its regular diet of lotus and fried hominy and out of this slow wreck of great expectations rose up j pinkney bloom with his wad and his prosperous cheery smile needless to say j pinkney was no product of georgia soil he came out of that flushed and capable region known as the north he called himself a promoter his enemies had spoken of him as a grafter okochee took a middle course and held him to be no better nor no worse than a yank far up the lake eighteen miles above the town the eye of this cheerful camp follower of booms had spied out a graft he purchased there a precipitous tract of five hundred acres at forty five cents per acre and this he laid out and subdivided as the city of skyland the queen city of the switzerland of the south streets and avenues were surveyed parks designed corners of central squares reserved for the proposed opera house board of trade lyceum market public schools and exposition hall the price of lots ranged from five to five hundred dollars positively no lot would be priced higher than five hundred dollars while the boom was growing in okochee j pinkney s circulars maps and prospectuses were flying through the mails to every part of the country investors sent in their money by post and the skyland real estate company j pinkney bloom returned to each a deed duly placed on record to the best lot at the price on hand that day all this time the catamount screeched upon the reserved lot of the skyland board of trade the opossum swung by his tail over the site of the exposition hall and the owl hooted a melancholy recitative to his audience of young squirrels in opera house square later when the money was coming in fast j pinkney caused to be erected in the coming city half a dozen cheap box houses and persuaded a contingent of indigent natives to occupy them thereby assuming the role of poulation in subsequent prospectuses which became accordingly more seductive and remunerative so when the dream faded and okochee dropped back to digging bait and nursing its two and a half per cent tax j pinkney bloom unloving of checks and drafts and the cold interrogatories of bankers strapped about his fifty two inch waist a soft leather belt containing eight thousand dollars in big bills and said that all was very good one last trip he was making to skyland before departing to other salad fields skyland was a regular post office and the steamboat dixie belle under contract delivered the mail bag generally empty twice a week there was a little business there to be settled the postmaster was to be paid off for his light but lonely services and the inhabitants had to be furnished with another month s homely rations as per agreement and then skyland would know j pinkney bloom no more the owners of these precipitous barren useless lots might come and view the scene of their invested credulity or they might leave them to their fit tenants the wild hog and the browsing deer the work of the skyland real estate company was finished the little steamboat dixie belle was about to shove off on her regular up the lake trip when a rickety hired carriage rattled up to the pier and a tall elderly gentleman in black stepped out signaling courteously but vivaciously for the boat to wait time was of the least importance in the schedule of the dixie belle captain macfarland gave the order and the boat received its ultimate two passengers for upon the arm of the tall elderly gentleman as he crossed the gangway was a little elderly lady with a gray curl depending quaintly forward of her left ear captain macfarland was at the wheel therefore it seemed to j pinkney bloom who was the only other passenger that it should be his to play the part of host to the boat s new guests who were doubtless on a scenery viewing expedition he stepped forward with that translucent child candid smile upon his fresh pink countenance with that air of unaffected sincerity that was redeemed from bluffness only by its exquisite calculation with that promptitude and masterly decision of manner that so well suited his calling with all his stock in trade well to the front he stepped forward to receive colonel and mrs peyton blaylock with the grace of a grand marshal or a wedding usher he escorted the two passengers to a side of the upper deck from which the scenery was supposed to present itself to the observer in increased quantity and quality there in comfortable steamer chairs they sat and began to piece together the random lines that were to form an intelligent paragraph in the big history of little events our home sir said colonel blaylock removing his wide brimmed rather shapeless black felt hat is in holly springs holly springs georgia i am very proud to make your acquaintance mr bloom mrs blaylock and myself have just arrived in okochee this morning sir on business business of importance in connection with the recent rapid march of progress in this section of our state the colonel smoothed back with a sweeping gesture his long smooth locks his dark eyes still fiery under the heavy black brows seemed inappropriate to the face of a business man he looked rather to be an old courtier handed down from the reign of charles and re attired in a modern suit of fine but raveling and seam worn broadcloth yes sir said mr bloom in his heartiest prospectus voice things have been whizzing around okochee biggest industrial revival and waking up to natural resources georgia ever had did you happen to squeeze in on the ground floor in any of the gilt edged grafts colonel well sir said the colonel hesitating in courteous doubt if i understand your question i may say that i took the opportunity to make an investment that i believe will prove quite advantageous yes sir i believe it will result in both pecuniary profit and agreeable occupation colonel blaylock said the little edlerly lady shaking her gray curl and smiling indulgent explanation at j pinkney bloom is so devoted to businesss he has such a talent for financiering and markets and investments and those kind of things i think myself extremely fortunate in having secured him for a partner on life s journey i am so unversed in those formidable but very useful branches of learning colonel blaylock rose and made a bow a bow that belonged with silk stockings and lace ruffles and velvet practical affairs he said with a wave of his hand toward the promoter are if i may use the comparison the garden walks upon which we tread through life viewing upon either side of us the flowers which brighten that journey it is my pleasure to be able to lay out a walk or two mrs blaylock sir is one of those fortunate higher spirits whose mission it is to make the flowers grow perhaps mr bloom you have perused the lines of lorella the southern poetess that is the name above which mrs blaylock has contributed to the press of the south for many years unfortunately said mr bloom with a sense of the loss clearly written upon his frank face i m like the colonel in the walk making business myself and i haven t had time to even take a sniff at the flowers poetry is a line i never dealt in it must be nice though quite nice it is the region smiled mrs blaylock in which my soul dwells my shawl peyton if you please the breeze comes a little chilly from yon verdured hills the colonel drew from the tail pocket of his coat a small shawl of knitted silk and laid it solicitously about the shoulders of the lady mrs blaylock sighed contentedly and turned her expressive eyes still as clear and unworldly as a child s upon the steep slopes that were slowly slipping past very fair and stately they looked in the clear morning air they seemed to speak in familiar terms to the responsive spirit of lorella my native hills she murmured dreamily see how the foliage drinks the sunlight from the hollows and dells mrs blaylock s maiden days said the colonel interpreting her mood to j pinkney bloom were spent among the mountains of northern georgia mountain air and mountain scenery recall to her those days holly springs where we have lived for twenty years is low and flat i fear that she may have suffered in health and spirits by so long a residence there that is one portent reason for the change we are making my dear can you not recall those lines you wrote entitled i think the georgia hills the poem that was so extensively copied by the southern press and praised so highly by the atlanta critics mrs blaylock turned a glance of speaking tenderness upon the colonel fingered for a moment the silvery curl that drooped upon her bosom then looked again toward the mountains without preliminary or affectation or demurral she began in rather thrilling and more deeply pitched tones to recite these lines the georgia hills the georgia hills oh heart why dost thou pine are not these sheltered lowlands fair with mead and bloom and vine ah as the slow paced river here broods on its natal rills my spirit drifts in longing sweet back to the georgia hills and through the close drawn curtained night i steal on sleep s slow wings back to my heart s ease slopes of pine where end my wanderings oh heaven seems nearer from their tops and farther earthly ills even in dreams if i may but dream of my georgia hills the grass upon their orchard sides is a fine couch to me the common note of each small bird passes all minstrelsy it would not seem so dread a thing if when the reaper wills he might come there and take my hand up in the georgia hills thats great stuff ma am said j pinkney bloom enthusiastically when the poetess had concluded i wish i had looked up poetry more than i have i was raised in the pine hills myself the mountains ever call to their children murmured mrs blaylock i feel that life will take on the rosy hue of hope again in among these beautiful hills peyton a little taste of the currant wine if you will be so good the journey though delightful in the extreme slightly fatigues me colonel blaylock again visited the depths of his prolific coat and produced a tightly corked rough black bottle mr bloom was on his feet in an instant let me bring a glass ma am you come along colonel there s a little table we can bring too maybe we can scare up some fruit or a cup of tea on board i ll ask mac mrs blaylock reclined at ease few royal ladies have held their royal prerogative with the serene grace of the petted southern woman the colonel with an air as gallant and assiduous as in the days of his courtship and j pinkney bloom with a ponderous agility half professional and half directed by some resurrected unnamed long forgotten sentiment formed a diversified but attentive court the currant wine wine home made from the holly springs fruit went round and then j pinkney began to hear something of holly springs life it seemed from the conversation of the blaylocks that the springs was decadent a third of the population had moved away business and the colonel was an authority on business had dwindled to nothing after carefully studying the field of opportunities open to capital he had sold his little property there for eight hundred dollars and invested it in one of the enterprises opened up by the book in okochee might i inquire sir said mr bloom in what particular line of business you inserted your coin i know that town as well as i know the regulations for illegal use of the mails i might give you a hunch as to whether you can make the game go or not j pinkney somehow had a kindly feeling toward these unsophisticated representatives of by gone days they were so simple impractical and unsuspecting he was glad that he happened not to have a gold brick or a block of that western bad boy silver mine stock along with him he would have disliked to unload on people he liked so well as he did these but there are some temptations toe enticing to be resisted no sir said colonel blaylock pausing to arrange the queen s wrap i did not invest in okochee i have made an exhaustive study of business conditions and i regard old settled towns as unfavorable fields in which to place capital that is limited in amount some months ago through the kindness of a friend there came into my hands a map and description of this new town of skyland that has been built upon the lake the description was so pleasing the future of the town set forth in such convincing arguments and its increasing prosperity portrayed in such an attractive style that i decided to take advantage of the opportunity it offered i carefully selected a lot in the centre of the business district although its price was the highest in the schedule five hundred dollars and made the purchase at once are you the man i mean did you pay five hundred dollars for a lot in skyland asked j pinkney bloom i did sir answered the colonel with the air of a modest millionaire explaining his success a lot most excellently situated on the same square with the opera house and only two squares from the board of trade i consider the purchase a most fortuitous one it is my intention to erect a small building upon it at once and open a modest book and stationery store during past years i have met with many pecuniary reverses and i now find it necessary to engage in some commercial occupation that will furnish me with a livelihood the book and stationery business though an humble one seems to me not inapt nor altogether uncongenial i am a graduate of the university of virginia and mrs blaylock s really wonderful acquaintance with belles lettres and poetic literature should go far toward insuring success of course mrs blaylock would not personally serve behind the counter with the nearly three hundred dollars i have remaining i can manage the building of a house by giving a lien on the lot i have an old friend in atlanta who is a partner in a large book store and he has agreed to furnish me with a stock of goods on credit on extremely easy terms i am pleased to hope sir that mrs blaylock s health and happiness will be increased by the change of locality already i fancy i can perceive the return of those roses that were once the hope and despair of georgia cavaliers again followed that wonderful bow as the colonel lightly touched the pale cheek of the poetess mrs blaylock blushing like a girl shook her curl and gave the colonel an arch reproving tap secret of eternal youth where art thou every second the answer comes here here here listen to thine own heartbeats weary seeker after external miracles those years said mrs blaylock in holly springs were long long long but now is the promised land in sight skyland a lovely name doubtless said the colonel we shall be able to secure comfortable accommodations at some modest hotel at reasonable rates our trunks are in okochee to be forwarded when we shall have made permanent arrangements j pinkney bloom excused himself went forward and stood by the captain at the wheel mac said he do you remember my telling you once that i sold one of those five hundred dollar lots in skyland seems i do grinned captain macfarland i m not a coward as a general rule went on the promoter but i always said that if i ever met the sucker that bought that lot i d run like a turkey now you see that old babe in the wood over there well he s the boy that drew the prize that was the only five hundred dollar lot that went the rest ranged from ten dollars to two hundred his wife writes poetry she s invented one about the high grounds of georgia that s way up in g they re going to skyland to open a book store well said macfarland with another grin it s a good thing you are along j p you can show em around town until they begin to feel at home he s got three hundred dollars left to build a house and store with went on j pinkney as if he were talking to himself and he thinks there s an open house up there captain macfarland released the wheel long enough to give his leg a roguish slap you old fat rascal he chuckled with a wink mac you re a fool said j pinkney bloom coldly he went back and joined the blaylocks where he sat less talkative with that straight furrow between his brows that always stood as a signal of schemes being shaped within there s a good many swindles connected with these booms he said presently what if this skyland should turn out to be one that is suppose business should be sort of dull there and no special sale for books my dear sir said colonel blaylock resting his hand upon the back of his wife s chair three times i have been reduced to almost penury by the duplicity of others but i have not yet lost faith in humanity if i have been deceived again still we may glean health and content if not worldly profit i am aware that there are dishonest schemers in the world who set traps for the unwary but even they are not altogether bad my dear can you recall those verses entitled he giveth the increase that you composed for the choir of our church in holly springs that was four years ago said mrs blaylock perhans i can repeat a verse or two the lily springs from the rotting mould pearls from the deep sea slime good will come out of nazareth all in god s own time to the hardest heart the softening grace cometh at last to bless guiding it right to help and cheer and succor in distress i cannot remember the rest the lines were not ambitious they were written to the music composed by a dear friend it s a fine rhyme just the same declared mr bloom it seems to ring the bell all right i guess i gather the sense of it it means that the rankest kind of a phony will give you the best end of it once in a while mr bloom strayed thoughtfully back to the captain and stood meditating ought to be in sight of the spires and gilded domes of skyland now in a few minutes chirruped macfarland shaking with enjoyment go to the devil said mr bloom still pensive and now upon the left bank they caught a glimpse of a white village high up on the hills smothered among green trees that was cold branch no boom town but the slow growth of many years cold branch lay on the edge of the grape and corn lands the big country road ran just back of the heights cold branch had nothing in common with the frisky ambition of okochee with its impertinent lake mac said j pinkney suddenly i want you to stop at cold branch there s a landing there that they made to use sometimes when the river was up can t said the captain grinning more broadly i ve got the united states mails on board right to day this boat s in the government service do you want to have the poor old captain keelhauled by uncle sam and the great city of skyland all disconsolate waiting for its mail i m ashamed of your extravagance j p mac almost whispered j pinkney in his danger line voice i looked into the engine room of the dixie belle a while ago don t you know of somebody that needs a new boiler cement and black japan can t hide flaws from me and then those shares of building and loan that you traded for repairs they were all yours of course i hate to mention these things but oh come now j p said the captain you know i was just fooling i

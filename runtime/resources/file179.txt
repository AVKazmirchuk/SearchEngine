at the table and asked is there a cup for the tea on the shelf by the window she answered when he turned again with the cup he saw her with eyes shining rapturously beginning upon a huge dill pickle that she had rooted out from the paper bags with a woman s unerring instinct he took it from her laughingly and poured the cup full of milk drink that first he ordered and then you shall have some tea and then a chicken wing if you are very good you shall have a pickle to morrow and now if you ll allow me to be your guest we ll have supper he drew up the other chair the tea brightened the girl s eyes and brought back some of her colour she began to eat with a sort of dainty ferocity like some starved wild animal she seemcd to regard the young man s presence and the aid he had rendered her as a natural thing not as though she undervalued the conventions but as one whose great stress gave her the right to put aside the artificial for the human but gradually with the return of strength and comfort came also a sense of the little conventions that belong and she began to tell him her little story it was one of a thousand such as the city yawns at every day the shop girl s story of insufficient wages further reduced by fines that go to swell the store s profits of time lost through illness and then of lost positions lost hope and the knock of the adventurer upon the green door but to rudolf the history sounded as big as the iliad or the crisis in junie s love test to think of you going through all that he exclaimed it was something fierce said the girl solemnly and you have no relatives or friends in the city none whatever i am all alone in the world too said rudolf after a pause i am glad of that said the girl promptly and somehow it pleased the young man to hear that she approved of his bereft condition very suddenly her eyelids dropped and she sighed deeply i m awfully sleepy she said and i feel so good then rudolf rose and took his hat i ll say good night a long night s sleep will be fine for you he held out his hand and she took it and said good night but her eyes asked a question so eloquently so frankly and pathetically that he answered it with words oh i m coming back to morrow to see how you are getting along you can t get rid of me so easily then at the door as though the way of his coming had been so much less important than the fact that he had come she asked how did you come to knock at my door he looked at her for a moment remembering the cards and felt a sudden jealous pain what if they had fallen into other hands as adventurous as his quickly he decided that she must never know the truth he would never let her know that he was aware of the strange expedient to which she had been driven by her great distress one of our piano tuners lives in this house he said i knocked at your door by mistake the last thing he saw in the room before the green door closed was her smile at the head of the stairway he paused and looked curiously about him and then he went along the hallway to its other end and coming back ascended to the floor above and continued his puzzled explorations every door that he found in the house was painted green wondering he descended to the sidewalk the fantastic african was still there rudolf confronted him with his two cards in his hand will you tell me why you gave me these cards and what they mean he asked in a broad good natured grin the negro exhibited a splendid advertisement of his master s profession dar it is boss he said pointing down the street but i spect you is a little late for de fust act looking the way he pointed rudolf saw above the entrance to a theatre the blazing electric sign of its new play the green door i m informed dat it s a fust rate show sah said the negro de agent what represents it pussented me with a dollar sah to distribute a few of his cards along with de doctah s may i offer you one of de doctah s cards sah at the corner of the block in which he lived rudolf stopped for a glass of beer and a cigar when he had come out with his lighted weed he buttoned his coat pushed back his hat and said stoutly to the lamp post on the corner all the same i believe it was the hand of fate that doped out the way for me to find her which conclusion under the circumstances certainly admits rudolf steiner to the ranks of the true followers of romance and adventure from the cabby s seat the cabby has his point of view it is more single minded perhaps than that of a follower of any other calling from the high swaying seat of his hansom he looks upon his fellow men as nomadic particles of no account except when possessed of migratory desires he is jehu and you are goods in transit be you president or vagabond to cabby you are only a fare he takes you up cracks his whip joggles your vertebrae and sets you down when time for payment arrives if you exhibit a familiarity with legal rates you come to know what contempt is if you find that you have left your pocketbook behind you are made to realise the mildness

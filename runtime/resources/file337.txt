more and somebody would a been snake bit with these artful dodges contributed by lonney s faithful coterie with the sonorous kinney perpetually sounding the picture s merits and with the solvent prestige of the pioneer briscoe covering it like a precious varnish it seemed that the san saba country could not fail to add a reputation as an art centre to its well known superiority in steer roping contests and achievements with the precarious busted flush thus was created for the picture an atmosphere due rather to externals than to the artist s brush but through it the people seemed to gaze with more of admiration there was a magic in the name of briscoe that counted high against faulty technique and crude colouring the old indian fighter and wolf slayer would have smiled grimly in his happy hunting grounds had he known that his dilettante ghost was thus figuring as an art patron two generations after his uninspired existence came the day when the senate was expected to pass the bill of senator mullens appropriating two thousand dollars for the purchase of the picture the gallery of the senate chamber was early preempted by lonny and the san saba lobby in the front row of chairs they sat wild haired self conscious jingling creaking and rattling subdued by the majesty of the council hall the bill was introduced went to the second reading and then senator mullens spoke

its questions by geometry and the multiplication table it was the day of the silver tongue the sweeping gesture the decorative apostrophe the moving peroration the senator spoke the san saba contingent sat breathing hard in the gallery its disordered hair hanging down to its eyes its sixteen ounce hats shifted restlessly from knee to knee below the distinguished senators either lounged at

and sentiment he referred casually to the picture in the outer hall it was unnecessary he said to dilate upon its merits the senators had seen for themselves the painter of the picture was the grandson of lucien briscoe then came the word pictures of briscoe s life set forth in thrilling colours his rude and venturesome life his simple minded love for the commonwealth he helped to upbuild his contempt for rewards and praise his extreme and sturdy independence and the great services he had rendered the state the subject of the oration was lucien briscoe the painting stood in the background serving simply as a means now happily brought forward through which the state might bestow a tardy recompense upon the descendent of its favourite son frequent enthusiastic applause from

s mind an unpleasant vague suspicion to the same effect his reticence increased and he gathered grass from the ground chewing it pensively the picture as a picture had been humiliatingly absent from the senator s arguments the painter had been held up as a grandson pure and simple while this was gratifying on certain lines it made art look little and slab sided the boy artist was thinking the hotel lonny stopped at was near the capitol it was near to the one o clock dinner hour when the appropriation had been passed by the senate the hotel clerk told lonny that a famous artist from new york had arrived in town that day and was in the hotel he was on his way westward to new mexico to study the effect of sunlight upon the ancient walls of the zunis modern stones reflect light those

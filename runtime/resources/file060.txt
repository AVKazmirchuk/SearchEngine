that fell from a dozen neighbouring shrubs and trees it would not have been preposterous for one to tiptoe and essay to touch the stars they hung so bright and imminent mr kinney s wife a young and capable woman we had left in the house she remained to busy herself with the domestic round of duties in which i had observed that she seemed to take a buoyant and contented pride in one room we had supped presently from the other as kinney and i sat without there burst a volume of sudden and brilliant music if i could justly estimate the art of piano playing the construer of that rollicking fantasia had creditably mastered the secrets of the keyboard a piano and one so well played seemed to me to be an unusual thing to find in that small and unpromising ranch house i must have looked my surprise at rush kinney for he laughed in his soft southern way and nodded at me through the moonlit haze of our cigarettes you don t often hear as agreeable a noise as that on a sheep ranch he remarked but i never see any reason for not playing up to the arts and graces just because we happen to live out in the brush it s a lonesome life for a woman and if a little music can make it any better why not have it that s the way i look at it a wise and generous theory i assented and mrs kinney plays well i am not learned in the science of music but i should call her an uncommonly good performer she has technic and more than ordinary power the moon was very bright you will understand and i saw upon kinney s face a sort of amused and pregnant expression as though there were things behind it that might be expounded you came up the trail from the double elm fork he said promisingly as you crossed it you must have seen an old deserted jacal to your left under a comma mott i did said i there was a drove of javalis rooting around it i could see by the broken corrals that no one lived there that s where this music proposition started said kinney i don t mind telling you about it while we smoke that s where old cal adams lived he had about eight hundred graded merinos and a daughter that was solid silk and as handsome as a new stake rope on a thirty dollar pony and i don t mind telling you that i was guilty in the second degree of hanging around old cal s ranch all the time i could spare away from lambing and shearing miss marilla was her name and i had figured it out by the rule of two that she was destined to become the chatelaine and lady superior of rancho lomito belonging to r kinney esq where you are now a welcome and honoured guest i will say that old cal wasn t distinguished as a sheepman he was a little old stoop shouldered hombre about as big as a gun scabbard with scraggy white whiskers and condemned to the continuous use of language old cal was so obscure in his chosen profession that he wasn t even hated by the cowmen and when a sheepman don t get eminent enough to acquire the hostility of the cattlemen he is mighty apt to die unwept and considerably unsung but that marilla girl was a benefit to the eye and she was the most elegant kind of a housekeeper i was the nearest neighbour and i used to ride over to the double elm anywhere from nine to sixteen times a week with fresh butter or a quarter of venison or a sample of new sheep dip just as a frivolous excuse to see marilla marilla and me got to be extensively inveigled with each other and i was pretty sure i was going to get my rope around her neck and lead her over to the lomito only she was so everlastingly permeated with filial sentiments toward old cal that i never could get her to talk about serious matters you never saw anybody in your life that was as full of knowledge and had less sense than old cal he was advised about all the branches of information contained in learning and he was up to all the rudiments of doctrines and enlightenment you couldn t advance him any ideas on any of the parts of speech or lines of thought you would have thought he was a professor of the weather and politics and chemistry and natural history and the origin of derivations any subject you brought up old cal could give you an abundant synopsis of it from the greek root up to the time it was sacked and on the market one day just after the fall shearing i rides over to the double elm with a lady s magazine about fashions for marilla and a scientific paper for old cal while i was tying my pony to a mesquite out runs marilla tickled to death with some news that couldn t wait oh rush she says all flushed up with esteem and gratification what do you think dad s going to buy me a piano ain t it grand i never dreamed i d ever have one it s sure joyful says i i always admired the agreeable uproar of a piano it ll be lots of company for you that s mighty good of uncle cal to do that i m all undecided says marilla between a piano and an organ a parlour organ is nice either of em says i is first class for mitigating the lack of noise around a sheep ranch for my part i says i shouldn t like anything better than to ride home of an evening and listen to

and verlaine just then i was trying to run a pipe from the pierian spring you were on the floor with her said octavia unde flected five times at the hammersmiths hammersmiths what questioned teddy vacuously ball ball said octavia viciously what were we talking of eyes i thought said teddy after some reflection and elbows those hammersmiths went on octavia in her sweetest society prattle after subduing an intense desire to yank a handful of sunburnt sandy hair from the head lying back contentedly against the canvas of the steamer chair had too much money mines wasn t it it was something that paid something to the ton you couldn t get a glass of plain water in their house everything at that ball was dreadfully overdone it was said teddy such a crowd there was octavia continued con scious that she was talking the rapid drivel of a school girl describing her first dance the balconies were as warm as the rooms i lost something at that ball the last sentence was uttered in a tone calculated to remove the barbs from miles of wire so did i confessed teddy in a lower voice a glove said octavia falling back as the enemy approached her ditches caste said teddy halting his firing line without loss i hobnobbed half the evening with one of hammersmith s miners a fellow who kept his hands in his pockets and talked like an archangel about reduction plants and drifts and levels and sluice boxes a pearl gray glove nearly new sighed octavia mournfully a bang up chap that mcardle maintained teddy approvingly a man who hated olives and elevators a man who handled mountains as croquettes and built tunnels in the air a man who never uttered a word of silly nonsense in his life did you sign those lease renewal applications yet madama they ve got to be on file in the land office by the thirty first teddy turned his head lazily octavia s chair was vacant a certain centipede crawling along the lines marked out by fate expounded the situation it was early one morning

their bedding ground during the night by a thunder storm the centipede driven by destiny showed himself on the floor of the gallery and then the screeches of the two women giving him his cue he scuttled with all his yellow legs through the open door into the furthermost west room which was teddy s arming themselves with domestic utensils selected with regard to their length octavia and mrs maclntyre with much clutching of skirts and skirmishing for the position of rear guard in the attacking force followed once outside the centipede seemed to have disappeared and his prospective murderers began a thorough but cautious search for their victim even in the midst of such a dangerous and absorbing adventure octavia was conscious of an awed curiosity on finding herself in teddy s sanctum in that room he sat alone silently communing with those secret thoughts that he now shared with no one dreamed there whatever dreams he now called on no one to interpret it was the room of a spartan or a soldier in one corner stood a wide canvas covered cot in another a small bookcase in another a grim stand of winchesters and shotguns an immense table strewn with letters papers and documents and surmounted by a set of pigeon holes occupied one side the centipede showed genius in concealing himself in such bare quarters mrs maclntyre was poking a broom handle behind the bookcase octavia approached teddy s cot the room was just as the manager had left it in his hurry the mexican maid had not yet given it her attention there was his big pillow with the imprint of his head still

conceived by many many months of nightly pressure beneath the pillow of the man who had forgotten the hammersmiths ball teddy must have left so hurriedly that morning that he had for once forgotten to transfer it to its resting place by day even managers who are notoriously wily and cunning are sometimes caught up with octavia slid the gray glove into the bosom of her sum mery morning gown it was hers men who put them selves within a strong barbed wire fence and remember hammersmith balls only by the talk of miners about sluice boxes should not be allowed to possess such articles after all what a paradise this prairie country was how it blossomed like the rose when you found things that were thought to be lost how delicious was that morning breeze coming in the windows fresh and sweet with the breath of the yellow ratama blooms might one not stand for a minute with shining far gazing eyes and dream that mistakes might be corrected why was mrs maclntyre poking about so absurdly with a broom i ve found it said mrs macintyre banging the door here it is did you lose something asked octavia with sweetly polite non interest the little devil said mrs maclntyre driven to violence ye ve no forgotten him alretty between them they slew the centipede thus was he rewarded for his agency toward the recovery of things lost at the hammersmiths ball it seems that teddy in due course

but he don t enjoy it new york ridicules him for blowing so much money in that town of sneaks and snobs and sneers the truth is he don t spend anything while he is there i saw a memorandum of expenses for a ten days trip to bunkum town made by a pittsburg man worth once here s the way he set it down r r fare to and from cab fare to and from hotel hotel bill per day tips total that s the voice of new york goes on andy the town s nothing but a head waiter if you tip it too much it ll go and stand by the door and make fun of you to the hat check boy when a pittsburger wants to spend money and have a good time he stays at home that s where we ll go to catch him well to make a dense story more condensed me and andy cached our paris green and antipyrine powders and albums in a friend s cellar and took the trail to pittsburg andy didn t have any especial prospectus of chicanery and violence drawn up but he always had plenty of confidence that his immoral nature would rise to any occasion that presented itself as a concession to my ideas of self preservation and rectitude he promised that if i should take an active and incriminating part in any little business venture that we might work up there should be something actual and cognizant to the senses of touch sight taste or smell to transfer to the victim for the money so my conscience might rest easy after that i felt better and entered more cheerfully into the foul play andy says i as we strayed through the smoke along the cinderpath they call smithfield street had you figured out how we are going to get acquainted with these coke kings and pig iron squeezers not that i would decry my own worth or system of drawing room deportment and work with the olive fork and pie knife says i but isn t the entree nous into the salons of the stogie smokers going to be harder than you imagined if there s any handicap at all says andy it s our own refinement and inherent culture pittsburg millionaires are a fine body of plain wholehearted unassuming democratic men they are rough but uncivil in their manners and though their ways are boisterous and unpolished under it all they have a great deal of impoliteness and discourtesy nearly every one of em rose from obscurity says andy and they ll live in it till the town gets to using smoke consumers if we act simple and unaffected and don t go too far from the saloons and keep making a noise like an import duty on steel rails we won t have any trouble in meeting some of em socially well andy and me drifted about town three or four days getting our bearings we got to knowing several millionaires by sight one used to stop his automobile in front of our hotel and have a quart of champagne brought out to him when the waiter opened it he d turn it up to his mouth and drink it out of the bottle that showed he used to be a glassblower before he made his money one evening andy failed to come to the hotel for dinner about o clock he came into my room landed one jeff says he twelve millions oil rolling mills real estate and natural gas he s a fine man no airs about him made all his money in the last five years he s got professors posting him up now in education art and literature and haberdashery and such things when i saw him he d just won a bet of with a steel corporation man that there d be four suicides in the allegheny rolling mills to day so everybody in sight had to walk up and have drinks on him he took a fancy to me and asked me to dinner with him we went to a restaurant in diamond alley and sat on stools and had a sparkling moselle and clam chowder and apple fritters then he wanted to show me his bachelor apartment on liberty street he s got ten rooms over a fish market with privilege of the bath on the next floor above he told me it cost him to furnish his apartment and i believe it he s got worth of pictures in one room and worth of curios and antiques in another his name s scudder and he s and taking lessons on the piano and barrels of oil a day out of his wells all right says i preliminary canter satisfactory but kay vooly voo what good is the art junk to us and the oil now that man says andy sitting thoughtfully on the bed ain t what you would call an ordinary scutt when he was showing me his cabinet of art curios his face lighted up like the door of a coke oven he says that if some of his big deals go through he ll make j p morgan s collection of sweatshop tapestry and augusta me beadwork look like the contents of an ostrich s craw thrown on a screen by a magic lantern and then he showed me a little carving went on andy that anybody could see was a wonderful thing it was something like years old he said it was a lotus flower with a woman s face in it carved out of a solid piece of ivory scudder looks it up in a catalogue and describes it an egyptian carver named khafra made two of em for king rameses ii about the year b c the other one can t be found the junkshops and antique bugs have rubbered all europe for it but it seems to be out of stock scudder paid for the one he has oh well says i this sounds like the purling of a rill to me i thought we came here to teach the millionaires business instead of learning art from em be patient says andy kindly maybe we will see a rift in the smoke ere long all the next morning andy was out i didn t see him until about noon he came to the hotel and called me into his room across the hall he pulled a roundish bundle about as big as a goose egg out of his pocket and unwrapped it it was an ivory carving just as he had described the millionaire s to me i went in an old second hand store and pawnshop a while ago says andy and i see this half hidden under a lot of old daggers and truck the pawnbroker said he d had it several years and thinks it was soaked by some arabs or turks or some foreign dubs that used to live down by the river i offered him for it and i must have looked like i wanted it for he said it would be taking the pumpernickel out of his children s mouths to hold any conversation that did not lead up to a price of i finally got it for jeff goes on andy this is the exact counterpart of scudder s carving it s absolutely a dead ringer for it he ll pay for it as quick as he d tuck a napkin under his chin and why shouldn t it be the genuine other one anyhow that the old gypsy whittled out why not indeed says i and how shall we go about compelling him to make a voluntary purchase of it andy had his plan all ready and i ll tell you how we carried it out i got a pair of blue spectacles put on my black frock coat rumpled my hair up and became prof pickleman i went to another hotel registered and sent a telegram to scudder to come to see me at once on important art business the elevator dumped him on me in less than an hour he was a foggy man with a clarion voice smelling of connecticut wrappers and naphtha hello profess he shouts how s your conduct i rumpled my hair some more and gave him a blue glass stare sir says i are you cornelius t scudder of pittsburg pennsylvania i am says he come out and have a drink i ve neither the time nor the desire says i for such harmful and deleterious amusements i have come from new york says i on a matter of busi on a matter of art i learned there that you are the owner of an egyptian ivory carving of the time of rameses ii representing the head of queen isis in a lotus flower there were only two of such carvings made one has been lost for many years i recently discovered and purchased the other in a pawn in an obscure museum in vienna i wish to purchase yours name your price well the great ice jams profess says scudder have you found the other one me sell no i don t guess cornelius scudder needs to sell anything that he wants to keep have you got the carving with you profess i shows it to scudder he examines it careful all over it s the article says he it s a duplicate of mine every line and curve of it tell you what i ll do he says i won t sell but i ll buy give you for yours since you won t sell i will says i large bills please i m a man of few words i must return to new york to night i lecture to morrow at the aquarium scudder sends a check down and the hotel cashes it he goes off with his piece of antiquity and i hurry back to andy s hotel according to arrangement andy is walking up and down the room looking at his watch well he says twenty five hundred says i cash we ve got just eleven minutes says andy to catch the b o westbound grab your baggage what s the hurry says i it was a square deal and even if it was only an imitation of the original carving it ll take him some time to find it out he seemed to be sure it was the genuine article it was says andy it was his own when i was looking at his curios yesterday he stepped out of the room for a moment and i pocketed it now will you pick up your suit case and hurry then says i why was that story about finding another one in the pawn oh says andy out of respect for that conscience of yours come on the man higher up across our two dishes of spaghetti in a corner of provenzano s restaurant jeff peters was explaining to me the three kinds of graft every winter jeff comes to new york to eat spaghetti to watch the shipping in east river from the depths of his chinchilla overcoat and to lay in a supply of chicago made clothing at one of the fulton street stores during the other three seasons he may be found further west his range is from spokane to tampa in his profession he takes a pride which he supports and defends with a serious and unique philosophy of ethics his profession is no new one he is an incorporated uncapitalized unlimited asylum for the reception of the restless and unwise dollars of his fellowmen in the wilderness of stone in which jeff seeks his annual lonely holiday he is glad to palaver of his many adventures as a boy will whistle after sundown in a wood wherefore i mark on my calendar the time of his coming and open a question of privilege at provenzano s concerning the little wine stained table in the corner between the rakish rubber plant and the framed palazzio della something on the wall there are two kinds of graft said jeff that ought to be wiped out by law i mean wall street speculation and burglary nearly everybody will agree with you as to one of them said i with a laugh well burglary ought to be wiped out too said jeff and i wondered whether the laugh had been redundant about three months ago said jeff it was my privilege to become familiar with a sample of each of the aforesaid branches of illegitimate art i was sine qua grata with a member of the housebreakers union and one of the john d napoleons of finance at the same time interesting combination said i with a yawn did i tell you i bagged a duck and a ground squirrel at one shot last week over in the ramapos i knew well how to draw jeff s stories let me tell you first about these barnacles that clog the wheels of society by poisoning the springs of rectitude with their upas like eye said jeff with the pure gleam of the muck raker in his own as i said three months ago i got into bad company there are two times in a man s life when he does this when he s dead broke and when he s rich now and then the most legitimate business runs out of luck it was out in arkansas i made the wrong turn at a cross road and drives into this town of peavine by mistake it seems i had already assaulted and disfigured peavine the spring of the year before i had sold worth of young fruit trees there plums cherries peaches and pears the peaviners were keeping an eye on the country road and hoping i might pass that way again i drove down main street as far as the crystal palace drugstore before i realized i had committed ambush upon myself and my white horse bill the peaviners took me by surprise and bill by the bridle and began a conversation that wasn t entirely disassociated with the subject of fruit trees a committee of em ran some trace chains through the armholes of my vest and escorted me through their gardens and orchards their fruit trees hadn t lived up to their labels most of em had turned out to be persimmons and dogwoods with a grove or two of blackjacks and poplars the only one that showed any signs of bearing anything was a fine young cottonwood that had put forth a hornet s nest and half of an old corset cover the peaviners protracted our fruitless stroll to the edge of town they took my watch and money on account and they kept bill and the wagon as hostages they said the first time one of them dogwood trees put forth an amsden s june peach i might come back and get my things then they took off the trace chains and jerked their thumbs in the direction of the rocky mountains and i struck a lewis and clark lope for the swollen rivers and impenetrable forests when i regained intellectualness i found myself walking into an unidentified town on the a t s f railroad the peaviners hadn t left anything in my pockets except a plug of chewing they wasn t after my life and that saved it i bit off a chunk and sits down on a pile of ties by the track to recogitate my sensations of thought and perspicacity and then along comes a fast freight which slows up a little at the town and off of it drops a black bundle that rolls for twenty yards in a cloud of dust and then gets up and begins to spit soft coal and interjections i see it is a young man broad across the face dressed more for pullmans than freights and with a cheerful kind of smile in spite of it all that made phoebe snow s job look like a chimney sweep s fall off says i nunk says he got off arrived at my destination what town is this haven t looked it up on the map yet says i i got in about five minutes before you did how does it strike you hard says he twisting one of his arms around i believe that shoulder no it s all right he stoops over to brush the dust off his clothes when out of his pocket drops a fine nine inch burglar s steel jimmy he picks it up and looks at me sharp and then grins and holds out his hand brother says he greetings didn t i see you in southern missouri last summer selling colored sand at half a dollar a teaspoonful to put into lamps to keep the oil from exploding oil says i never explodes it s the gas that forms that explodes but i shakes hands with him anyway my name s bill bassett says he to me and if you ll call it professional pride instead of conceit i ll inform you that you have the pleasure of meeting the best burglar that ever set a gum shoe on ground drained by the mississippi river well me and this bill bassett sits on the ties and exchanges brags as artists in kindred lines will do it seems he didn t have a cent either and we went into close caucus he explained why an able burglar sometimes had to travel on freights by telling me that a servant girl had played him false in little rock and he was making a quick get away it s part of my business says bill bassett to play up to the ruffles when i want to make a riffle as raffles tis loves that makes the bit go round show me a house with a swag in it and a pretty parlor maid and you might as well call the silver melted down and sold and me spilling truffles and that chateau stuff on the napkin under my chin while the police are calling it an inside job just because the old lady s nephew teaches a bible class i first make an impression on the girl says bill and when she lets me inside i make an impression on the locks but this one in little rock done me says he she saw me taking a trolley ride with another girl and when i came round on the night she was to leave the door open for me it was fast and i had keys made for the doors upstairs but no sir she had sure cut off my locks she was a delilah says bill bassett it seems that bill tried to break in anyhow with his jimmy but the girl emitted a succession of bravura noises like the top riders of a tally ho and bill had to take all the hurdles between there and the depot as he had no baggage they tried hard to check his departure but he made a train that was just pulling out well says bill bassett when we had exchanged memories of our dead lives i could eat this town don t look like it was kept under a yale lock suppose we commit some mild atrocity that will bring in temporary expense money i don t suppose you ve brought along any hair tonic or rolled gold watch chains or similar law defying swindles that you could sell on the plaza to the pikers of the paretic populace have you no says i i left an elegant line of patagonian diamond earrings and rainy day sunbursts in my valise at peavine but they re to stay there until some of those black gum trees begin to glut the market with yellow clings and japanese plums i reckon we can t count on them unless we take luther burbank in for a partner very well says bassett we ll do the best we can maybe after dark i ll borrow a hairpin from some lady and open the farmers and drovers marine bank with it while we were talking up pulls a passenger train to the depot near by a person in a high hat gets off on the wrong side of the train and comes tripping down the track towards us he was a little fat man with a big nose and rat s eyes but dressed expensive and carrying a hand satchel careful as if it had eggs or railroads bonds in it he passes by us and keeps on down the track not appearing to notice the town come on says bill bassett to me starting after him where i asks lordy says bill had you forgot you was in the desert didn t you see colonel manna drop down right before your eyes don t you hear the rustling of general raven s wings i m surprised at you elijah we overtook the stranger in the edge of some woods and as it was after sun down and in a quiet place nobody saw us stop him bill takes the silk hat off the man s head and brushes it with his sleeve and puts it back what does this mean sir says the man when i wore one of these says bill and felt embarrassed i always done that not having one now i had to use yours i hardly know how to begin sir in explaining our business with you but i guess we ll try your pockets first bill bassett felt in all of them and looked disgusted not even a watch he says ain t you ashamed of yourself you whited sculpture going about dressed like a head waiter and financed like a count you haven t even got carfare what did you do with your transfer the man speaks up and says he has no assets or valuables of any sort but bassett takes his hand satchel and opens it out comes some collars and socks and a half a page of a newspaper clipped out bill reads the clipping careful and holds out his hand to the held up party brother says he greetings accept the apologies of friends i am bill bassett the burglar mr peters you must make the acquaintance of mr alfred e ricks shake hands mr peters says bill stands about halfway between me and you mr ricks in the line of havoc and corruption he always gives something for the money he gets i m glad to meet you mr ricks you and mr peters this is the first time i ever attended a full gathering of the national synod of sharks housebreaking swindling and financiering all represented please examine mr rick s credentials mr peters the piece of newspaper that bill bassett handed me had a good picture of this ricks on it it was a chicago paper and it had obloquies of ricks in every paragraph by reading it over i harvested the intelligence that said alleged ricks had laid off all that portion of the state of florida that lies under water into town lots and sold em to alleged innocent investors from his magnificently furnished offices in chicago after he had taken in a hundred thousand or so dollars one of these fussy purchasers that are always making trouble i ve had em actually try gold watches i ve sold em with acid took a cheap excursion down to the land where it is always just before supper to look at his lot and see if it didn t need a new paling or two on the fence and market a few lemons in time for the christmas present trade he hires a surveyor to find his lot for him they run the line out and find the flourishing town of paradise hollow so advertised to be about rods and poles s degrees e of the middle of lake okeechobee this man s lot was under thirty six feet of water and besides had been preempted so long by the alligators and gars that his title looked fishy naturally the man goes back to chicago and makes it as hot for alfred e ricks as the morning after a prediction of snow by the weather bureau ricks defied the allegation but he couldn t deny the alligators one morning the papers came out with a column about it and ricks come out by the fire escape it seems the alleged authorities had beat him to the safe deposit box where he kept his winnings and ricks has to westward ho with only feetwear and a dozen and a half english pokes in his shopping bag he happened to have some mileage left in his book and that took him as far as the town in the wilderness where he was spilled out on me and bill bassett as elijah iii with not a raven in sight for any of us then this alfred e ricks lets out a squeak that he is hungry too and denies the hypothesis that he is good for the value let alone the price of a meal and so there was the three of us representing if we had a mind to draw syllogisms and parabolas labor and trade and capital now when trade has no capital there isn t a dicker to be made and when capital has no money there s a stagnation in steak and onions that put it up to the man with the jimmy brother bushrangers says bill bassett never yet in trouble did i desert a pal hard by in yon wood i seem to see unfurnished lodgings let us go there and wait till dark there was an old deserted cabin in the grove and we three took possession of it after dark bill bassett tells us to wait and goes out for half an hour he comes back with a armful of bread and spareribs and pies panhandled em at a farmhouse on washita avenue says he eat drink and be leary the full moon was coming up bright so we sat on the floor of the cabin and ate in the light of it and this bill bassett begins to brag sometimes says he with his mouth full of country produce i lose all patience with you people that think you are higher up in the profession than i am now what could either of you have done in the present emergency to set us on our feet again could you do it ricksy i must confess mr bassett says ricks speaking nearly inaudible out of a slice of pie that at this immediate juncture i could not perhaps promote an enterprise to relieve the situation large operations such as i direct naturally require careful preparation in advance i i know ricksy breaks in bill bassett you needn t finish you need to make the first payment on a blond typewriter and four roomsful of quartered oak furniture and you need more for advertising contracts and you need two weeks time for the fish to begin to bite your line of relief would be about as useful in an emergency as advocating municipal ownership to cure a man suffocated by eighty cent gas and your graft ain t much swifter brother peters he winds up oh says i i haven t seen you turn anything into gold with your wand yet mr good fairy most anybody could rub the magic ring for a little left over victuals that was only getting the pumpkin ready says bassett braggy and cheerful the coach and six ll drive up to the door before you know it miss cinderella maybe you ve got some scheme under your sleeve holders that will give us a start son says i i m fifteen years older than you are and young enough yet to take out an endowment policy i ve been broke before we can see the lights of that town not half a mile away i learned under montague silver the greatest street man that ever spoke from a wagon there are hundreds of men walking those streets this moment with grease spots on their clothes give me a gasoline lamp a dry goods box and a two dollar bar of white castile soap cut into little where s your two dollars snickered bill bassett into my discourse there was no use arguing with that burglar no he goes on you re both babes in the wood finance has closed the mahogany desk and trade has put the shutters up both of you look to labor to start the wheels going all right you admit it to night i ll show you what bill bassett can do bassett tells me and ricks not to leave the cabin till he comes back even if it s daylight and then he starts off toward town whistling gay this alfred e ricks pulls off his shoes and his coat lays a silk handkerchief over his hat and lays down on the floor i think i will endeavor to secure a little slumber he squeaks the day has been fatiguing good night my dear mr peters my regards to morpheus says i i think i ll sit up a while about two o clock as near as i could guess by my watch in peavine home comes our laboring man and kicks up ricks and calls us to the streak of bright moonlight shining in the cabin door then he spreads out five packages of one thousand dollars each on the floor and begins to cackle over the nest egg like a hen i ll tell you a few things about that town says he it s named rocky springs and they re building a masonic temple and it looks like the democratic candidate for mayor is going to get soaked by a pop and judge tucker s wife who has been down with pleurisy is getting some better i had a talk on these liliputian thesises before i could get a siphon in the fountain of knowledge that i was after and there s a bank there called the lumberman s fidelity and plowman s savings institution it closed for business yesterday with cash on hand it will open this morning with all silver that s the reason i didn t bring more there you are trade and capital now will you be bad my young friend says alfred e ricks holding up his hands have you robbed this bank dear me dear me you couldn t call it that says bassett robbing sounds harsh all i had to do was to find out what street it was on that town is so quiet that i could stand on the corner and hear the tumblers clicking in that safe lock right to left twice to right once to left to as plain as the yale captain giving orders in the football dialect now boys says bassett this is an early rising town they tell me the citizens are all up and stirring before daylight i asked what for and they said because breakfast was ready at that time and what of merry robin hood it must be yoicks and away with the tinkers chorus i ll stake you how much do you want speak up capital my dear young friend says this ground squirrel of a ricks standing on his hind legs and juggling nuts in his paws i have friends in denver who would assist me if i had a hundred dollars i basset unpins a package of the currency and throws five twenties to ricks trade how much he says to me put your money up labor says i i never yet drew upon honest toil for its hard earned pittance the dollars i get are surplus ones that are burning the pockets of damfools and greenhorns when i stand on a street corner and sell a solid gold diamond ring to a yap for i make just and i know he s going to give it to a girl in return for all the benefits accruing from a ring his profits are which of us is the biggest fakir and when you sell a poor woman a pinch of sand for fifty cents to keep her lamp from exploding says bassett what do you figure her gross earnings to be with sand at forty cents a ton listen says i i instruct her to keep her lamp clean and well filled if she does that it can t burst and with the sand in it she knows it can t and she don t worry it s a kind of industrial christian science she pays fifty cents and gets both rockefeller and mrs eddy on the job it ain t everybody that can let the gold dust twins do their work alfred e ricks all but licks the dust off of bill bassett s shoes my dear young friend says he i will never forget your generosity heaven will reward you but let me implore you to turn from your ways of violence and crime mousie says bill the hole in the wainscoting for yours your dogmas and inculcations sound to me like the last words of a bicycle pump what has your high moral elevator service system of pillage brought you to penuriousness and want even brother peters who insists upon contaminating the art of robbery with theories of commerce and trade admitted he was on the lift both of you live by the gilded rule brother peters says bill you d better choose a slice of this embalmed currency you re welcome i told bill bassett once more to put his money in his pocket i never had the respect for burglary that some people have i always gave something for the money i took even if it was only some little trifle for a souvenir to remind em not to get caught again and then alfred e ricks grovels at bill s feet again and bids us adieu he says he will have a team at a farmhouse and drive to the station below and take the train for denver it salubrified the atmosphere when that lamentable boll worm took his departure he was a disgrace to every non industrial profession in the country with all his big schemes and fine offices he had wound up unable even to get an honest meal except by the kindness of a strange and maybe unscrupulous burglar i was glad to see him go though i felt a little sorry for him now that he was ruined forever what could such a man do without a big capital to work with why alfred e ricks as we left him was as helpless as turtle on its back he couldn t have worked a scheme to beat a little girl out of a penny slate pencil when me and bill bassett was left alone i did a little sleight of mind turn in my head with a trade secret at the end of it thinks i i ll show this mr burglar man the difference between business and labor he had hurt some of my professional self adulation by casting his persians upon commerce and trade i won t take any of your money as a gift mr bassett says i to him but if you ll pay my expenses as a travelling companion until we get out of the danger zone of the immoral deficit you have caused in this town s finances to night i ll be obliged bill bassett agreed to that and we hiked westward as soon as we could catch a safe train when we got to a town in arizona called los perros i suggested that we once more try our luck on terra cotta that was the home of montague silver my old instructor now retired from business i knew monty would stake me to web money if i could show him a fly buzzing round the locality bill bassett said all towns looked alike to him as he worked mainly in the dark so we got off the train in los perros a fine little town in the silver region i had an elegant little sure thing in the way of a commercial slungshot that i intended to hit bassett behind the ear with i wasn t going to take his money while he was asleep but i was going to leave him with a lottery ticket that would represent in experience to him i think that was the amount he had when we got off the train but the first time i hinted to him about an investment he turns on me and disencumbers himself of the following terms and expressions brother peters says he it ain t a bad idea to go into an enterprise of some kind as you suggest i think i will but if i do it will be such a cold proposition that nobody but robert e peary and charlie fairbanks will be able to sit on the board of directors i thought you might want to turn your money over says i i do says he frequently i can t sleep on one side all night i ll tell you brother peters says he i m going to start a poker room i don t seem to care for the humdrum in swindling such as peddling egg beaters and working off breakfast food on barnum and bailey for sawdust to strew in their circus rings but the gambling business says he from the profitable side of the table is a good compromise between swiping silver spoons and selling penwipers at a waldorf astoria charity bazar then says i mr bassett you don t care to talk over my little business proposition why says he do you know you can t get a pasteur institute to start up within fifty miles of where i live i bite so seldom so bassett rents a room over a saloon and looks around for some furniture and chromos the same night i went to monty silver s house and he let me have on my prospects then i went to the only store in los perros that sold playing cards and bought every deck in the house the next morning when the store opened i was there bringing all the cards back with me i said that my partner that was going to back me in the game had changed his mind and i wanted to sell the cards back again the storekeeper took em at half price yes i was seventy five dollars loser up to that time but while i had the cards that night i marked every one in every deck that was labor and then trade and commerce had their innings and the bread i had cast upon the waters began to come back in the form of cottage pudding with wine sauce of course i was among the first to buy chips at bill bassett s game he had bought the only cards there was to be had in town and i knew the back of every one of them better than i know the back of my head when the barber shows me my haircut in the two mirrors when the game closed i had the five thousand and a few odd dollars and all bill bassett had was the wanderlust and a black cat he had bought for a mascot bill shook hands with me when i left brother peters says he i have no business being in business i was preordained to labor when a no burglar tries to make a james out of his jimmy he perpetrates an improfundity you have a well oiled and efficacious system of luck at cards says he peace go with you and i never afterward sees bill bassett again well jeff said i when the autolycan adventurer seemed to have divulged the gist of his tale i hope you took care of the money that would be a respecta that is a considerable working capital if you should choose some day to settle down to some sort of regular business me said jeff virtuously you can bet i ve taken care of that five thousand he tapped his coat over the region of his chest exultantly gold mining stock he explained every cent of it shares par value one dollar bound to go up per cent within a year non assessable the blue gopher mine just discovered a month ago better get in yourself if you ve any spare dollars on hand sometimes said i these mines are not oh this one s solid as an old goose said jeff fifty thousand dollars worth of ore in sight and per cent monthly earnings guaranteed he drew out a long envelope from his pocket and cast it on the table always carry it with me said he so the burglar can t corrupt or the capitalist break in and water it i looked at the beautifully engraved certificate of stock in colorado i see said i and by the way jeff what was the name of the little man who went to denver the one you and bill met at the station alfred e ricks said jeff was the toad s designation i see said i the president of this mining company signs himself a l fredericks i was wondering let me see that stock said jeff quickly almost snatching it from me to mitigate even though slightly the embarrassment i summoned the waiter and ordered another bottle of the barbera i thought it was the least i could do a tempered wind the first time my optical nerves was disturbed by the sight of buckingham skinner was in kansas city i was standing on a corner when i see buck stick his straw colored head out of a third story window of a business block and holler whoa there whoa like you would in endeavoring to assuage a team of runaway mules i looked around but all the animals i see in sight is a policeman having his shoes shined and a couple of delivery wagons hitched to posts then in a minute downstairs tumbles this buckingham skinner and runs to the corner and stands and gazes down the other street at the imaginary dust kicked up by the fabulous hoofs of the fictitious team of chimerical quadrupeds and then b skinner goes back up to the third story room again and i see that the lettering on the window is the farmers friend loan company by and by straw top comes down again and i crossed the street to meet him for i had my ideas yes sir when i got close i could see where he overdone it he was reub all right as far as his blue jeans and cowhide boots went but he had a matinee actor s hands and the rye straw stuck over his ear looked like it belonged to the property man of the old homestead co curiosity to know what his graft was got the best of me was that your team broke away and run just now i asks him polite i tried to stop em says i but i couldn t i guess they re half way back to the farm by now gosh blame them darned mules says straw top in a voice so good that i nearly apologized they re a lus bustin loose and then he looks at me close and then he takes off his hayseed hat and says in a different voice i d like to shake hands with parleyvoo pickens the greatest street man in the west barring only montague silver which you can no more than allow i let him shake hands with me i learned under silver i said i don t begrudge him the lead but what s your graft son i admit that the phantom flight of the non existing animals at which you remarked whoa has puzzled me somewhat how do you win out on the trick buckingham skinner blushed pocket money says he that s all i am temporarily unfinanced this little coup de rye straw is good for forty dollars in a town of this size how do i work it why i involve myself as you perceive in the loathsome apparel of the rural dub thus embalmed i am jonas stubblefield a name impossible to improve upon i repair noisily to the office of some loan company conveniently located in the third floor front there i lay my hat and yarn gloves on the floor and ask to mortgage my farm for to pay for my sister s musical education in europe loans like that always suit the loan companies it s ten to one that when the note falls due the foreclosure will be leading the semiquavers by a couple of lengths well sir i reach in my pocket for the abstract of title but i suddenly hear my team running away i run to the window and emit the word or exclamation which ever it may be viz whoa then i rush down stairs and down the street returning in a few minutes dang them mules i says they done run away and busted the doubletree and two traces now i got to hoof it home for i never brought no money along reckon we ll talk about that loan some other time gen lemen then i spreads out my tarpaulin like the israelites and waits for the manna to drop why no mr stubblefield says the lobster colored party in the specs and dotted pique vest oblige us by accepting this ten dollar bill until to morrow get your harness repaired and call in at ten we ll be pleased to accommodate you in the matter of this loan it s a slight thing says buckingham skinner modest but as i said only for temporary loose change it s nothing to be ashamed of says i in respect for his mortification in case of an emergency of course it s small compared to organizing a trust or bridge whist but even the chicago university had to be started in a small way what s your graft these days buckingham skinner asks me the legitimate says i i m handling rhinestones and dr oleum sinapi s electric headache battery and the swiss warbler s bird call a small lot of the new queer ones and twos and the bonanza budget consisting of a rolled gold wedding and engagement ring six egyptian lily bulbs a combination pickle fork and nail clipper and fifty engraved visiting cards no two names alike all for the sum of cents two months ago says buckingham skinner i was doing well down in texas with a patent instantaneous fire kindler made of compressed wood ashes and benzine i sold loads of em in towns where they like to burn niggers quick without having to ask somebody for a light and just when i was doing the best they strikes oil down there and puts me out of business your machine s too slow now pardner they tells me we can have a coon in hell with this here petroleum before your old flint and tinder truck can get him warm enough to perfess religion and so i gives up the kindler and drifts up here to k c this little curtain raiser you seen me doing mr pickens with the simulated farm and the hypothetical teams ain t in my line at all and i m ashamed you found me working it no man says i kindly need to be ashamed of putting the skibunk on a loan corporation for even so small a sum as ten dollars when he is financially abashed still it wasn t quite the proper thing it s too much like borrowing money without paying it back i liked buckingham skinner from the start for as good a man as ever stood over the axles and breathed gasoline smoke and pretty soon we gets thick and i let him in on a scheme i d had in mind for some time and offers to go partners anything says buck that is not actually dishonest will find me willing and ready let us perforate into the inwardness of your proposition i feel degraded when i am forced to wear property straw in my hair and assume a bucolic air for the small sum of ten dollars actually mr pickens it makes me feel like the ophelia of the great occidental all star one night consolidated theatrical aggregation this scheme of mine was one that suited my proclivities by nature i am some sentimental and have always felt gentle toward the mollifying elements of existence i am disposed to be lenient with the arts and sciences and i find time to instigate a cordiality for the more human works of nature such as romance and the atmosphere and grass and poetry and the seasons i never skin a sucker without admiring the prismatic beauty of his scales i never sell a little auriferous beauty to the man with the hoe without noticing the beautiful harmony there is between gold and green and that s why i liked this scheme it was so full of outdoor air and landscapes and easy money we had to have a young lady assistant to help us work this graft and i asked buck if he knew of one to fill the bill one says i that is cool and wise and strictly business from her pompadour to her oxfords no ex toe dancers or gum chewers or crayon portrait canvassers for this buck claimed he knew a suitable feminine and he takes me around to see miss sarah malloy the minute i see her i am pleased she looked to be the goods as ordered no sign of the three p s about her no peroxide patchouli nor peau de soie about twenty two brown hair pleasant ways the kind of a lady for the place a description of the sandbag if you please she begins why ma am says i this graft of ours is so nice and refined and romantic it would make the balcony scene in romeo and juliet look like second story work we talked it over and miss malloy agreed to come in as a business partner she said she was glad to get a chance to give up her place as stenographer and secretary to a suburban lot company and go into something respectable this is the way we worked our scheme first i figured it out by a kind of a proverb the best grafts in the world are built up on copy book maxims and psalms and proverbs and esau s fables they seem to kind of hit off human nature our peaceful little swindle was constructed on the old saying the whole push loves a lover one evening buck and miss malloy drives up like blazes in a buggy to a farmer s door she is pale but affectionate clinging to his arm always clinging to his arm any one can see that she is a peach and of the cling variety they claim they are eloping for to be married on account of cruel parents they ask where they can find a preacher farmer says b gum there ain t any preacher nigher than reverend abels four miles over on caney creek farmeress wipes her hand on her apron and rubbers through her specs illustration she is a peach and of the cling variety then lo and look ye up the road from the other way jogs parleyvoo pickens in a gig dressed in black white necktie long face sniffing his nose emitting a spurious kind of noise resembling the long meter doxology b jinks says farmer if thar ain t a preacher now it transpires that i am rev abijah green travelling over to little bethel school house for to preach next sunday the young folks will have it they must be married for pa is pursuing them with the plow mules and the buckboard so the reverend green after hesitating marries em in the farmer s parlor and farmer grins and has in cider and says b gum and farmeress sniffles a bit and pats the bride on the shoulder and parleyvoo pickens the wrong reverend writes out a marriage certificate and farmer and farmeress sign it as witnesses and the parties of the first second and third part gets in their vehicles and rides away oh that was an idyllic graft true love and the lowing kine and the sun shining on the red barns it certainly had all other impostures i know about beat to a batter so the reverend green after hesitations marries em in the farmer s parlor i suppose i happened along in time to marry buck and miss malloy at about twenty farm houses i hated to think how the romance was going to fade later on when all them marriage certificates turned up in banks where we d discounted em and the farmers had to pay them notes of hand they d signed running from to on the th day of may us three divided about miss malloy nearly cried with joy you don t often see a tenderhearted girl or one that is bent on doing right boys says she dabbing her eyes with a little handkerchief this stake comes in handier than a powder rag at a fat men s ball it gives me a chance to reform i was trying to get out of the real estate business when you fellows came along but if you hadn t taken me in on this neat little proposition for removing the cuticle of the rutabaga propagators i m afraid i d have got into something worse i was about to accept a place in one of these women s auxiliary bazars where they build a parsonage by selling a spoonful of chicken salad and a cream puff for seventy five cents and calling it a business man s lunch now i can go into a square honest business and give all them queer jobs the shake i m going to cincinnati and start a palm reading and clairvoyant joint as madame saramaloi the egyptian sorceress i shall give everybody a dollar s worth of good honest prognostication good by boys take my advice and go into some decent fake get friendly with the police and newspapers and you ll be all right so then we all shook hands and miss malloy left us me and buck also rose up and sauntered off a few hundred miles for we didn t care to be around when them marriage certificates fell due with about between us we hit that bumptious little town off the new jersey coast they call new york if there ever was an aviary overstocked with jays it is that yaptown on the hudson cosmopolitan they call it you bet so s a piece of fly paper you listen close when they re buzzing and trying to pull their feet out of the sticky stuff little old new york s good enough for us that s what they sing there s enough reubs walk down broadway in one hour to buy up a week s output of the factory in augusta maine that makes knaughty knovelties and the little phine phun oroide gold finger ring that sticks a needle in your friend s hand you d think new york people was all wise but no they don t get a chance to learn everything s too compressed even the hayseeds are baled hayseeds but what else can you expect from a town that s shut off from the world by the ocean on one side and new jersey on the other it s no place for an honest grafter with a small capital there s too big a protective tariff on bunco even when giovanni sells a quart of warm worms and chestnut hulls he has to hand out a pint to an insectivorous cop and the hotel man charges double for everything in the bill that he sends by the patrol wagon to the altar where the duke is about to marry the heiress but old badville near coney is the ideal burg for a refined piece of piracy if you can pay the bunco duty imported grafts come pretty high the custom house officers that look after it carry clubs and it s hard to smuggle in even a bib and tucker swindle to work brooklyn with unless you can pay the toll but now me and buck having capital descends upon new york to try and trade the metropolitan backwoodsmen a few glass beads for real estate just as the vans did a hundred or two years ago at an east side hotel we gets acquainted with romulus g atterbury a man with the finest head for financial operations i ever saw it was all bald and glossy except for gray side whiskers seeing that head behind an office railing and you d deposit a million with it without a receipt this atterbury was well dressed though he ate seldom and the synopsis of his talk would make the conversation of a siren sound like a cab driver s kick he said he used to be a member of the stock exchange but some of the big capitalists got jealous and formed a ring that forced him to sell his seat atterbury got to liking me and buck and he begun to throw on the canvas for us some of the schemes that had caused his hair to evacuate he had one scheme for starting a national bank on that made the mississippi bubble look as solid as a glass marble he talked this to us for three days and when his throat was good and sore we told him about the roll we had atterbury borrowed a quarter from us and went out and got a box of throat lozenges and started all over again this time he talked bigger things and he got us to see em as he did the scheme he laid out looked like a sure winner and he talked me and buck into putting our capital against his burnished dome of thought it looked all right for a kid gloved graft it seemed to be just about an inch and a half outside of the reach of the police and as money making as a mint it was just what me and buck wanted a regular business at a permanent stand with an open air spieling with tonsilitis on the street corners every evening so in six weeks you see a handsome furnished set of offices down in the wall street neighborhood with the golconda gold bond and investment company in gilt letters on the door and you see in his private room with the door open the secretary and treasurer mr buckingham skinner costumed like the lilies of the conservatory with his high silk hat close to his hand nobody yet ever saw buck outside of an instantaneous reach for his hat and you might perceive the president and general manager mr r g atterbury with his priceless polished poll busy in the main office room

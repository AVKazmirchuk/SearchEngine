not the right but they saw a long shadow come bobbing up the sunlit road and then came a shorter one bobbing by its side and presently two strange figures approached the church the long shadow was made by miss phoebe summers the organist come to practise tommy teague aged twelve was responsible for the shorter shadow it was tommy s day to pump the organ for miss phoebe and his bare toes proudly spurned the dust of the road miss phoebe in her lilac spray chintz dress with her accurate little curls hanging over each ear courtesied low to father abram and shook her curls ceremoniously at miss chester then she and her assistant climbed the steep stairway to the organ loft in the gathering shadows below father abram and miss chester lingered they were silent and it is likely that they were busy with their memories miss chester sat leaning her head on her hand with her eyes fixed far away father abram stood in the next pew looking thoughtfully out of the door at the road and the ruined cottage suddenly the scene was transformed for him back almost a score of years into the past for as tommy pumped away miss phoebe struck a low bass note on the organ and held it to test the volume of air that it contained the church ceased to exist so far as father abram was concerned the deep booming vibration that shook the little frame building was no note from an organ but the humming of the mill machinery he felt sure that the old overshot wheel was turning that he was back again a dusty merry miller in the old mountain mill and now evening was come and soon would come aglaia with flying colours toddling across the road to take him home to supper father abram s eyes were fixed upon the broken door of the cottage and then came another wonder in the gallery overhead the sacks of flour were stacked in long rows perhaps a mouse had been at one of them anyway the jar of the deep organ note shook down between the cracks of the gallery floor a stream of flour covering father abram from head to foot with the white dust and then the old miller stepped into the aisle and waved his arms and began to sing the miller s song the wheel goes round the grist is ground the dusty miller s merry and then the rest of the miracle happened miss chester was leaning forward from her pew as pale as the flour itself her wide open eyes staring at father abram like one in a waking dream when he began the song she stretched out her arms to him her lips moved she called to him in dreamy tones da da come take dums home miss phoebe released the low key of the organ but her work had been well done the note that she struck had beaten down the doors of a closed memory and father abram held his lost aglaia close in his arms when you visit lakelands they will tell you more of this story they will tell you how the lines of it were afterward traced and the history of the miller s daughter revealed after the gipsy wanderers had stolen her on that september day attracted by her childish beauty but you should wait until you sit comfortably on the shaded porch of the eagle house and then you can have the story at your ease it seems best that our part of it should close while miss phoebe s deep bass note was yet reverberating softly and yet to my mind the finest thing of it all happened while father abram and his daughter were walking back to the eagle house in the long twilight almost too glad to speak father she said somewhat timidly and doubtfully have you a great deal of money a great deal said the miller well that depends there is plenty unless you want to buy the moon or something equally expensive would it cost very very much asked aglaia who had always counted her dimes so carefully to send a telegram to atlanta ah said father abram with a little sigh i see you want to ask ralph to come aglaia looked up at him with a tender smile i want to ask him to wait she said i have just found my father and i want it to be just we two for a while i want to tell him he will have to wait new york by camp fire light away out in the creek nation we learned things about new york we were on a hunting trip and were camped one night on the bank of a little stream bud kingsbury was our skilled hunter and guide and it was from his lips that we had explanations of manhattan and the queer folks that inhabit it bud had once spent a month in the metropolis and a week or two at other times and he was pleased to discourse to us of what he had seen fifty yards away from our camp was pitched the teepee of a wandering family of indians that had come up and settled there for the night an old old indian woman was trying to build a fire under an iron pot hung upon three sticks bud went over to her assistance and soon had her fire going when he came back we complimented him playfully upon his gallantry oh said bud don t mention it it s a way i have whenever i see a lady trying to cook things in a pot and having trouble i always go to the rescue i done the same thing once in a high toned house in new york city heap big society teepee on fifth avenue that injun lady kind of recalled it to my mind yes i

either to do a piece of immortal literature or to shock the public or to please editors some of them succeeded in all three but they did not write the truth most autobiographies are insincere from beginning to end about the only chance for the truth to be told is in fiction it is well understood that all the truth cannot be told in print but how about nothing but the truth that s what i want to do i want the man who is telling the story to tell it not as he would to a reading public or to a confessor but something in this way suppose he were marooned on an island in mid ocean with no hope of ever being rescued and in order to pass away some of the time he should tell a story to himself embodying his adventure and experiences and opinions having a certain respect for himself let us hope he would leave out the realism that he would have no chance of selling in the market he would omit the lies and self conscious poses and would turn out to his one auditor something real and true so as truth is not to be found in history autobiography press reports nor at the bottom of an h g wells let us hope that fiction may be the means of bringing out a few grains of it the hero of the story will be a man born and raised in a somnolent little southern town his education is about a common school one but he learns afterward from reading and life i m going to try to give him a style in narrative and speech the best i ve got in the shop i m going to take him through all the main phases of life wild adventure city society something of the under world and among many characteristic planes of the phases i want him to acquire all the sophistication that experience can give him and always preserve his individual honest human view and have him tell the truth about everything it is time to say now that by the truth i don t mean the objectionable stuff that so often masquerades under the name i mean true opinions a true estimate of all things as they seem to the hero if you find a word or a suggestive line or sentence in any of my copy you cut it out and deduct it from the royalties i want this man to be a man of natural intelligence of individual character absolutely open and broad minded and show how the creator of the earth has got him in a rat trap put him here willy nilly you know the omar verse and then i want to show what he does about it there is always the eternal question from the primal source what are you going to do about it please don t think for the half of a moment that the story is going to be anything of an autobiography i have a distinct character in my mind for the part and he does not at all here the letter ends he never finished it the story of holding up a train in sixes and sevens there appears an article entitled holding up a train now the facts were given to o henry by an old and dear friend who in his wild avenging youth had actually held up trains to day he is mr al jennings of oklahoma city okla a prominent attorney he has permitted the publication of two letters o henry wrote him the first outlining the story as he thought his friend jennings ought to write it and the second announcing that with o henry s revision the manuscript had been accepted from w s porter to al jennings september st year not given but probably dear pard in regard to that article i will give you my idea of what is wanted say we take for a title the art and humor of the hold up or something like that i would suggest that in writing you assume a character we have got to respect the conventions and delusions of the public to a certain extent an article written as you would naturally write it would be regarded as a fake and an imposition remember that the traditions must be preserved wherever they will not interfere with the truth write in as simple plain and unembellished a style as you know how make your sentences short put in as much realism and as many facts as possible where you want to express an opinion or comment on the matter do it as practically and plainly as you can give it life and the vitality of facts now i will give you a sort of general synopsis of my idea of course everything is subject to your own revision and change the article we will say is written by a typical train hoister one without your education and powers of expression bouquet but intelligent enough to convey his ideas from his standpoint not from john wanamaker s yet in order to please john we will have to assume a virtue that we do not possess comment on the moral side of the proposition as little as possible do not claim that holding up trains is the only business a gentleman would engage in and on the contrary do not depreciate a profession that is really only fnanciering with spurs on describe the facts and details all that part of the proceedings that the passenger sitting with his hands up in a pullman looking into the end of a tunnel in the hands of one of the performers does not see here is a rough draft of my idea begin abruptly without any philosophizing with your idea of the best times places and conditions for the hold up compare your opinions of this with those of others

but i think i saw you place a paper in this file this afternoon and it is barely possible that it may be of value to me i was also impressed with the idea that you desired to remove it again but had not the opportunity anyway i shall keep it until to morrow and let the commissioner decide far back among mr sharp s ancestors there must have been some of the old berserker blood for his caution his presence of mind left him and left him possessed of a blind devilish unreasoning rage that showed itself in a moment in the white glitter of his eye give me that file boy he said thickly holding out his hand i am no such fool mr sharp said the youth this file shall be laid before the commissioner to morrow for examination if he finds help help sharp was upon him like a tiger and bore him to the floor the boy was strong and vigorous but the suddenness of the attack gave him no chance to resist he struggled up again to his feet but it was an animal with blazing eyes and cruel looking teeth that fought him instead of a man mr sharp a man of high standing and good report was battling for his reputation presently there was a dull sound and another and still one more and a blade flashing white and then red and edward harris dropped down like some stuffed effigy of a man that boys make for sport with his limbs all crumpled and lax on the stone floor of the land office the old watchman was deaf and heard nothing the little dog barked at the foot of the stairs until his master made him come into his room sharp stood there for several minutes holding in his hand his bloody clasp knife listening to the cooing of the pigeons on the roof and the loud ticking of the clock above the receiver s desk a map rustled on the wall and his blood turned to ice a rat ran across some strewn papers and his scalp prickled and he could scarcely moisten his dry lips with his tongue between the file room and the draftsman s room there is a door that opens on a small dark spiral stairway that winds from the lower floor to the ceiling at the top of the house this stairway was not used then nor is it now it is unnecessary inconvenient dusty and dark as night and was a blunder of the architect who designed the building this stairway ends above at the tent shaped space between the roof and the joists that space is dark and forbidding and being useless is rarely visited sharp opened this door and gazed for a moment up this narrow cobwebbed stairway after dark that night a man opened cautiously one of the lower windows of the land office crept out with great circumspection and disappeared in the shadows one afternoon a week after this time sharp lingered behind again after the clerks had left and the office closed the next morning the first comers noticed a broad mark in the dust on the upstairs floor and the same mark was observed below stairs near a window it appeared as if some heavy and rather bulky object had been dragged along through the limestone dust a memorandum book with e harris written on the flyleaf was picked up on the stairs but nothing particular was thought of any of these signs circulars and advertisements appeared for a long time in the papers asking for information concerning edward harris who left his mother s home on a certain date and had never been heard of since after a while these things were succeeded by affairs of more recent interest and faded from the public mind sharp died two years ago respected and regretted the last two years of his life were clouded with a settled melancholy for which his friends could assign no reason the bulk of his comfortable fortune was made from the land he obtained by fraud and crime the disappearance of the file was a mystery that created some commotion in the land office but he got his patent it is a well known tradition in austin and vicinity that there is a buried treasure of great value somewhere on the banks of shoal creek about a mile west of the city three young men living in austin recently became possessed of what they thought was a clue of the whereabouts of the treasure and thursday night they repaired to the place after dark and plied the pickaxe and shovel with great diligence for about three hours at the end of that time their efforts were rewarded by the finding of a box buried about four feet below the surface which they hastened to open the light of a lantern disclosed to their view the fleshless bones of a human skeleton with clothing still wrapping its uncanny limbs they immediately left the scene and notified the proper authorities of their ghastly find on closer examination in the left breast pocket of the skeleton s coat there was found a flat oblong packet of papers cut through and through in three places by a knife blade and so completely soaked and clotted with blood that it had become an almost indistinguishable mass with the aid of a microscope and the exercise of a little imagination this much can be made out of the letter at the top of the papers b x a rip n queries and answers from the rolling stone june can you inform me where i can buy an interest in a newspaper of some kind i have some money and would be glad to invest it in

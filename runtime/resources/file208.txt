man says he to himself but according to the old proverb charity covers a multitude of skins so he puts up eighty million dollars worth of libraries and the boys with the dinner pail that builds em gets the benefit where s the books asks the reading public i dinna ken says b i offered ye libraries and there they are i suppose if i d given ye preferred steel trust stock instead ye d have wanted the water in it set out in cut glass decanters hoot for ye but as i said the owning of so much money was beginning to give me philanthropitis it was the first time me and andy had ever made a pile big enough to make us stop and think how we got it andy says i we re wealthy not beyond the dreams of average but in our humble way we are comparatively as rich as greasers i feel as if i d like to do something for as well as to humanity i was thinking the same thing jeff says he we ve been gouging the public for a long time with all kinds of little schemes from selling self igniting celluloid collars to flooding georgia with hoke smith presidential campaign buttons i d like myself to hedge a bet or two in the graft game if i could do it without actually banging the cymbalines in the salvation army or teaching a bible class by the bertillon system what ll we do says andy give free grub to the poor or send a couple of thousand to george cortelyou neither says i we ve got too much money to be implicated in plain charity and we haven t got enough to make restitution so we ll look about for something that s about half way between the two the next day in walking around floresville we see on a hill a big red brick building that appears to be disinhabited the citizens speak up and tell us that it was begun for a residence several years before by a mine owner after running up the house he finds he only had left to furnish it with so he invests that in whiskey and jumps off the roof on a spot where he now requiescats in pieces as soon as me and andy saw that building the same idea struck both of us we would fix it up with lights and pen wipers and professors and put an iron dog and statues of hercules and father john on the lawn and start one of the finest free educational institutions in the world right there so we talks it over to the prominent citizens of floresville who falls in fine with the idea they give a banquet in the engine house to us and we make our bow for the first time as benefactors to the cause of progress and enlightenment andy makes an hour and a half speech on the subject of irrigation in lower egypt and we have a moral tune on the phonograph and pineapple sherbet andy and me didn t lose any time in philanthropping we put every man in town that could tell a hammer from a step ladder to work on the building dividing it up into class rooms and lecture halls we wire to frisco for a car load of desks footballs arithmetics penholders dictionaries chairs for the professors slates skeletons sponges twenty seven cravenetted gowns and caps for the senior class and an open order for all the truck that goes with a first class university i took it on myself to put a campus and a curriculum on the list but the telegraph operator must have got the words wrong being an ignorant man for when the goods come we found a can of peas and a curry comb among em while the weekly papers was having chalk plate cuts of me and andy we wired an employment agency in chicago to express us f o b six professors immediately one english literature one up to date dead languages one chemistry one political economy democrat preferred one logic and one wise to painting italian and music with union card the esperanza bank guaranteed salaries which was to run between and well sir we finally got in shape over the front door was carved the words the world s university peters tucker patrons and proprietors and when september the first got a cross mark on the calendar the come ons begun to roll in first the faculty got off the tri weekly express from tucson they was mostly young spectacled and red headed with sentiments divided between ambition and food andy and me got em billeted on the floresvillians and then laid for the students they came in bunches we had advertised the university in all the state papers and it did us good to see how quick the country responded two hundred and nineteen husky lads aging along from up to chin whiskers answered the clarion call of free education they ripped open that town sponged the seams turned it lined it with new mohair and you couldn t have told it from harvard or goldfields at the march term of court they marched up and down the streets waving flags with the world s university colors ultra marine and blue and they certainly made a lively place of floresville andy made them a speech from the balcony of the skyview hotel and the whole town was out celebrating in about two weeks the professors got the students disarmed and herded into classes i don t believe there s any pleasure equal to being a philanthropist me and andy bought high silk hats and pretended to dodge the two reporters of the floresville gazette the paper had a man to kodak us whenever we appeared on the street and ran our pictures every week over the column headed educational notes andy lectured twice

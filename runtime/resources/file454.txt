sidereal spheres from his attic window in the rue de bologny shudders as he turns his telescope upon the solitary figure upon the spire sacre bleu he hisses between his new celluloid teeth it is tictocq the detective i wonder whom he is following now while tictocq is watching with lynx like eyes the hill of montmartre he suddenly hears a heavy breathing beside him and turning gazes into the ferocious eyes of the gray wolf carnaignole cusheau had put on his w u tel co climbers and climbed the steeple parbleu monsieur says tictocq to whom am i indebted for the honor of this visit the gray wolf smiled softly and depreciatingly you are tictocq the detective he said i am then listen i am the murderer of marie cusheau she was my wife and she had cold feet and ate onions what was i to do yet life is sweet to me i do not wish to be guillotined i have heard that you are on my track is it true that the case is in your hands it is thank le bon dieu then i am saved the gray wolf carefully adjusts the climbers on his feet and descends the spire tictocq takes out his notebook and writes in it at last he says i have a clue monsieur le compte carnaignole cusheau once known as the gray wolf stands in the magnificent drawing room of his palace on east th street three days after his confession to tictocq he happened to look in the pockets of a discarded pair of pants and found twenty

the room count carnaignole stops him one moment monsieur the count carnaignole tears from his own face a false beard and reveals the flashing eyes and well known features of tictocq the detective then springing forward he snatches a wig and false eyebrows from his visitor and the gray wolf grinding his teeth in rage stands before him the murderer of marie cusheau was never discovered a snapshot at

trees caught platt s eye at once and he must turn along under the winding walk beneath them the lights shone upon two bright tears in the model s eyes i don t like that said platt what s the matter don t you mind said miss asher well it s because well i didn t think you were that kind when i first saw you but you are all like and now will you take me home or will i have to call a cop platt took her to the door of her boarding house they stood for a minute in the vestibule she looked at him with such scorn in her eyes that even his heart of oak began to waver his arm was half way around her waist when she struck him a stinging blow on the face with her open hand as he stepped back a ring fell from somewhere and bounded on the tiled floor platt groped for it and found it now take your useless diamond and go mr buyer she said this was the other one the wedding ring said the texan holding the smooth gold band on the palm of his hand miss asher s eyes blazed upon him in the half darkness was that what you meant did you somebody opened the door from inside the house good night said platt i ll see you at the store to morrow miss asher ran up to her room and shook the school teacher until she sat up in bed ready to scream fire where is it she cried that s what i want to know said the model you ve studied geography emma and you ought to know where is a town called cac cac carac caracas city i think they called it how dare you wake me up for that said the school teacher caracas is in venezuela of course what s it like why it s principally earthquakes and negroes and monkeys and malarial fever and volcanoes i don t care said miss asher blithely i m going there to morrow the badge of policeman o roon it cannot be denied that men and women have looked upon one another for the first time and become instantly enamored it is a risky process this love at first sight before she has seen him in bradstreet or he has seen her in curl papers but these things do happen and one instance must form a theme for this story though not thank heaven to the overshadowing of more vital and important subjects such as drink policemen horses and earldoms during a certain war a troop calling itself the gentle riders rode into history and one or two ambuscades the gentle riders were recruited from the aristocracy of the wild men of the west and the wild men of the aristocracy of the east in khaki there is little telling them one from another so they became good friends and comrades all around ellsworth remsen whose old knickerbocker descent atoned for his modest rating at only ten millions ate his canned beef gayly by the campfires of the gentle riders the war was a great lark to him so that he scarcely regretted polo and planked shad one of the troopers was a well set up affable cool young man who called himself o roon to this young man remsen took an especial liking the two rode side by side during the famous mooted up hill charge that was disputed so hotly at the time by the spaniards and afterward by the democrats after the war remsen came back to his polo and shad one day a well set up affable cool young man disturbed him at his club and he and o roon were soon pounding each other and exchanging opprobrious epithets after the manner of long lost friends o roon looked seedy and out of luck and perfectly contented but it seemed that his content was only apparent get me a job remsen he said i ve just handed a barber my last shilling no trouble at all said remsen i know a lot of men who have banks and stores and things downtown any particular line you fancy yes said o roon with a look of interest i took a walk in your central park this morning i d like to be one of those bobbies on horseback that would be about the ticket besides it s the only thing i could do i can ride a little and the fresh air suits me think you could land that for me remsen was sure that he could and in a very short time he did and they who were not above looking at mounted policemen might have seen a well set up affable cool young man on a prancing chestnut steed attending to his duties along the driveways of the park and now at the extreme risk of wearying old gentlemen who carry leather fob chains and elderly ladies who but no grandmother herself yet thrills at foolish immortal romeo there must be a hint of love at first sight it came just as remsen was strolling into fifth avenue from his club a few doors away a motor car was creeping along foot by foot impeded by a freshet of vehicles that filled the street in the car was a chauffeur and an old gentleman with snowy side whiskers and a scotch plaid cap which could not be worn while automobiling except by a personage not even a wine agent would dare do it but these two were of no consequence except perhaps for the guiding of the machine and the paying for it at the old gentleman s side sat a young lady more beautiful than pomegranate blossoms more exquisite than the first quarter moon viewed at twilight through the tops of oleanders remsen saw her and knew his fate he could have flunk himself under the very wheels that conveyed her but he knew that would be the last means of attracting the attention of those who ride in motor cars slowly the auto passed and if we place the poets above the autoists carried the heart of remsen with it here was a large city of millions and many women who at a certain distance appear to resemble pomegranate blossoms yet he hoped to see her again for each one fancies that his romance has its own tutelary guardian and divinity luckily for remsen s peace of mind there came a diversion in the guise of a reunion of the gentle riders of the city there were not many of them perhaps a score and there was wassail and things to eat and speeches and the spaniard was bearded again in recapitulation and when daylight threatened them the survivors prepared to depart but some remained upon the battlefield one of these was trooper o roon who was not seasoned to potent liquids his legs declined to fulfil the obligations they had sworn to the police department i m stewed remsen said o roon to his friend why do they build hotels that go round and round like catherine wheels they ll take away my shield and break me i can think and talk con con consec sec secutively but i s s stammer with my feet i ve got to go on duty in three hours the jig is up remsen the jig is up i tell you look at me said remsen who was his smiling self pointing to his own face whom do you see here goo fellow said o roon dizzily goo old remsen not so said remsen you see mounted policeman o roon look at your face no you can t do that without a glass but look at mine and think of yours how much alike are we as two french table d hote dinners with your badge on your horse in your uniform will i charm nurse maids and prevent the grass from growing under people s feet in the park this day i will have your badge and your honor besides having the jolliest lark i ve been blessed with since we licked spain promptly on time the counterfeit presentment of mounted policeman o roon single footed into the park on his chestnut steed in a uniform two men who are unlike will look alike two who somewhat resemble each other in feature and figure will appear as twin brothers so remsen trotted down the bridle paths enjoying himself hugely so few real pleasures do ten millionaires have along the driveway in the early morning spun a victoria drawn by a pair of fiery bays there was something foreign about the affair for the park is rarely used in the morning except by unimportant people who love to be healthy poor and wise in the vehicle sat an old gentleman with snowy side whiskers and a scotch plaid cap which could not be worn while driving except by a personage at his side sat the lady of remsen s heart the lady who looked like pomegranate blossoms and the gibbous moon remsen met them coming at the instant of their passing her eyes looked into his and but for the ever coward s heart of a true lover he could have sworn that she flushed a faint pink he trotted on for twenty yards and then wheeled his horse at the sound of runaway hoofs the bays had bolted remsen sent his chestnut after the victoria like a shot there was work cut out for the impersonator of policeman o roon the chestnut ranged alongside the off bay thirty seconds after the chase began rolled his eye back at remsen and said in the only manner open to policemen s horses well you duffer are you going to do your share you re not o roon but it seems to me if you d lean to the right you could reach the reins of that foolish slow running bay ah you re all right o roon couldn t have done it more neatly the runaway team was tugged to an inglorious halt by remsen s tough muscles the driver released his hands from the wrapped reins jumped from his seat and stood at the heads of the team the chestnut approving his new rider danced and pranced reviling equinely the subdued bays remsen lingering was dimly conscious of a vague impossible unnecessary old gentleman in a scotch cap who talked incessantly about something and he was acutely conscious of a pair of violet eyes that would have drawn saint pyrites from his iron pillar or whatever the allusion is and of the lady s smile and look a little frightened but a look that with the ever coward hears of a true lover he could not yet construe they were asking his name and bestowing upon him wellbred thanks for his heroic deed and the scotch cap was especially babbling and insistent but the eloquent appeal was in the eyes of the lady a little thrill of satisfaction ran through remsen because he had a name to give which without undue pride was worthy of being spoken in high places and a small fortune which with due pride he could leave at his end without disgrace he opened his lips to speak and closed them again who was he mounted policeman o roon the badge and the honor of his comrade were in his hands if ellsworth remsen ten millionaire and knickerbocker had just rescued pomegranate blossoms and scotch cap from possible death where was policeman o roon off his beat exposed disgraced discharged love had come but before that there had been something that demanded precedence the fellowship of men on battlefields fighting an alien foe remsen touched his cap looked between the chestnut s ears and took refuge in vernacularity don t mention it he said stolidly we policemen are paid to do these things it s our duly and he rode away rode away cursing noblesse oblige but knowing he could never have clone anything else at the end of the day remsen sent the chestnut to his stable and went to o roon s room the policeman was again a well set up affable cool young man who sat by the window smoking cigars i wish you and the rest of the police force and all badges horses brass buttons and men who can t drink two glasses of brut without getting upset were at the devil said remsen feelingly o roon smiled with evident satisfaction good old remsen he said affably i know all about it they trailed me down and cornered me here two hours ago there was a little row at home you know and i cut sticks just to show them i don t believe i told you that my governor was the earl of ardsley funny you should bob against them in the park if you damaged that horse of mine i ll never forgive you i m going to buy him and take him back with me oh yes and i think my sister lady angela you know wants particularly for you to come up to the hotel with me this evening didn t lose my badge did you remsen i ve got to turn that in at headquarters when i resign brickdust row blinker was displeased a man of less culture and poise and wealth would have sworn but blinker always remembered that he was a gentleman a thing that no gentleman should do so he merely looked bored and sardonic while he rode in a hansom to the center of disturbance which was the broadway office of lawyer oldport who was agent for the blinker estate i don t see said blinker why i should be always signing confounded papers i am packed and was to have left for the north woods this morning now i must wait until to morrow morning i hate night trains my best razors are of course at the bottom of some unidentifiable trunk it is a plot to drive me to bay rum and a monologueing thumb handed barber give me a pen that doesn t scratch i hate pens that scratch sit down said double chinned gray lawyer oldport the worst has not been told you oh the hardships of the rich the papers are not yet ready to sign they will be laid before you to morrow at eleven you will miss another day twice shall the barber tweak the helpless nose of a blinker be thankful that your sorrows do not embrace a haircut if said blinker rising the act did not involve more signing of papers i would take my business out of your hands at once give me a cigar please if said lawyer oldport i had cared to see an old friend s son gulped down at one mouthful by sharks i would have ordered you to take it away long ago now let s quit fooling alexander besides the grinding task of signing your name some thirty times to morrow i must impose upon you the consideration of a matter of business of business and i may say humanity or right i spoke to you about this five years ago but you would not listen you were in a hurry for a coaching trip i think the subject has come up again the property oh property interrupted blinker dear mr oldport i think you mentioned to morrow let s have it all at one dose to morrow signatures and property and snappy rubber bands and that smelly sealing wax and all have luncheon with me well i ll try to remember to drop in at eleven to morrow morning the blinker wealth was in lands tenements and hereditaments as the legal phrase goes lawyer oldport had once taken alexander in his little pulmonary gasoline runabout to see the many buildings and rows of buildings that he owned in the city for alexander was sole heir they had amused blinker very much the houses looked so incapable of producing the big sums of money that lawyer oldport kept pilling up in banks for him to spend in the evening blinker went to one of his clubs intending to dine nobody was there except some old fogies playing whist who spoke to him with grave politeness and glared at him with savage contempt everybody was out of town but here he was kept in like a schoolboy to write his name over and over on pieces of paper his wounds were deep blinker turned his back on the fogies and said to the club steward who had come forward with some nonsense about cold fresh salmon roe symons i m going to coney island he said it as one might say all s off i m going to jump into the river the joke pleased symons he laughed within a sixteenth of a note of the audibility permitted by the laws governing employees certainly sir he tittered of course sir i think i can see you at coney mr blinker blinker got a pager and looked up the movements of sunday steamboats then he found a cab at the first corner and drove to a north river pier he stood in line as democratic as you or i and bought a ticket and was trampled upon and shoved forward until at last he found himself on the upper deck of the boat staring brazenly at a girl who sat alone upon a camp stool but blinker did not intend to be brazen the girl was so wonderfully good looking that he forgot for one minute that he was the prince incog and behaved just as he did in society she was looking at him too and not severely a puff of wind threatened blinker s straw hat he caught it warily and settled it again the movement gave the effect of a bow the girl nodded and smiled and in another instant he was seated at her side she was dressed all in white she was paler than blinker imagined milkmaids and girls of humble stations to be but she was as tidy as a cherry blossom and her steady supremely frank gray eyes looked out from the intrepid depths of an unshadowed and untroubled soul how dare you raise your hat to me she asked with a smile redeemed severity i didn t blinker said but he quickly covered the mistake by extending it to i didn t know how to keep from it after i saw you i do not allow gentlemen to sit by me to whom i have not been introduced she said with a sudden haughtiness that deceived him he rose reluctantly but her clear teasing laugh brought him down to his chair again i guess you weren t going far she declared with beauty s magnificent self confidence are you going to coney island asked blinker me she turned upon him wide open eyes full of bantering surprise why what a question can t you see that i m riding a bicycle in the park her drollery took the form of impertinence and i am laying brick on a tall factory chimney said blinker mayn t we see coney together i m all alone and i ve never been there before it depends said the girl on how nicely you behave i ll consider your application until we get there blinker took pains to provide against the rejection of his application he strove to please to adopt the metaphor of his nonsensical phrase he laid brick upon brick on the tall chimney of his devoirs until at length the structure was stable and complete the manners of the best society come around finally to simplicity and as the girl s way was that naturally they were on a mutual plane of communication from the beginning he learned that she was twenty and her name was florence that she trimmed hats in a millinery shop that she lived in a furnished room with her best chum elia who was cashier in a shoe store and that a glass of milk from the bottle on the window sill and an egg that boils itself while you twist up your hair makes a breakfast good enough for any one florence laughed when she heard blinker well she said it certainly slows that you have imagination it gives the smiths a chance for a little rest anyhow they landed at coney and were dashed on the crest of a great human wave of mad pleasure seekers into the walks and avenues of fairyland gone into vaudeville with a curious eye a critical mind and a fairly withheld judgment blinker considered the temples pagodas and kiosks of popularized delights hoi polloi trampled hustled and crowded him basket parties bumped him sticky children tumbled howling under his feet candying his clothes insolent youths strolling among the booths with hard won canes under one arm and easily won girls on the other blew defiant smoke from cheap cigars into his face the publicity gentlemen with megaphones each before his own stupendous attraction roared like niagara in his ears music of all kinds that could be tortured from brass reed hide or string fought in the air to grain space for its vibrations against its competitors but what held blinker in awful fascination was the mob the multitude the proletariat shrieking struggling hurrying panting hurling itself in incontinent frenzy with unabashed abandon into the ridiculous sham palaces of trumpery and tinsel pleasures the vulgarity of it its brutal overriding of all the tenets of repression and taste that were held by his caste repelled him strongly in the midst of his disgust he turned and looked down at florence by his side she was ready with her quick smile and upturned happy eyes as bright and clear as the water in trout pools the eyes were saying that they had the right to be shining and happy for was their owner not with her for the present man her gentleman friend and holder of the keys to the enchanted city of fun blinker did not read her look accurately but by some miracle he suddenly saw coney aright he no longer saw a mass of vulgarians seeking gross joys he now looked clearly upon a hundred thousand true idealists their offenses were wiped out counterfeit and false though the garish joys of these spangled temples were he perceived that deep under the gilt surface they offered saving and apposite balm and satisfaction to the restless human heart here at least was the husk of romance the empty but shining casque of chivalry the breath catching though safe guarded dip and flight of adventure the magic carpet that transports you to the realms of fairyland though its journey be trough but a few poor yards of space he no longer saw a rabble but his brothers seeking the ideal there was no magic of poesy here or of art but the glamour of their imagination turned yellow calico into cloth of gold and the megaphones into the silver trumpets of joy s heralds almost humbled blinker rolled up the shirt sleeves of his mind and joined the idealists you are the lady doctor he said to florence how shall we go about doing this jolly conglomeration of fairy tales incorporated we will begin there said the princess pointing to a fun pagoda on the edge of the sea and we will take there all in one by one they caught the eight o clock returning boat and sat filled with pleasant fatigue against the rail in the bow listening to the italians fiddle and harp blinker had thrown off all care the north woods seemed to him an uninhabitable wilderness what a fuss he had made over signing his name pooh he could sign it a hundred times and her name was as pretty as she was florence he said it to himself a great many times as the boat was nearing its pier in the north river a two funnelled drab foreign looking sea going steamer was dropping down toward the bay the boat turned its nose in toward its slip the steamer veered as if to seek midstream and then yawed seemed to increase its speed and struck the coney boat on the side near the stern cutting into it with a terrifying shock and crash while the six hundred passengers on the boat were mostly tumbling about the decks in a shrieking panic the captain was shouting at the steamer that it should not back off and leave the rent exposed for the water to enter but the steamer tore its way out like a savage sawfish and cleaved its heartless way full speed ahead the boat began to sink at its stern but moved slowly toward the slip the passengers were a frantic mob unpleasant to behold blinker held florence tightly until the boat had righted itself she made no sound or sign of fear he stood on a camp stool ripped off the slats above his head and pulled down a number of the life preservers he began to buckle one around florence the rotten canvas split and the fraudulent granulated cork came pouring out in a stream florence caught a handful of it and laughed gleefully it looks like breakfast food she said take it off they re no good she unbuckled it and threw it on the deck she made blinker sit down and sat by his side and put her hand in his what ll you bet we don t reach the pier all right she said and began to hum a song and now the captain moved among the passengers and compelled order the boat would undoubtedly make her slip he said and ordered the women and children to the bow where they could land first the boat very low in the water at the stern tried gallantly to make his promise good florence said blinker as she held him close by an arm and hand i love you that s what they all say she replied lightly i am not one of they all he persisted i never knew any one i could love before i could pass my life with you and be happy every day i am rich i can make things all right for you that s what they all say said the girl again weaving the words into her little reckless song don t say that again said blinker in a tone that made her look at him in frank surprise why shouldn t i say it she asked calmly they all do who are they he asked jealous for the first time in his existence why the fellows i know do you know so many oh well i m not a wall flower she answered with modest complacency where do you see these these men at your home of course not i meet them just as i did you sometimes on the boat sometimes in the park sometimes on the street i m a pretty good judge of a man i can tell in a minute if a fellow is one who is likely to get fresh what do you mean by fresh why try to kiss you me i mean do any of them try that asked blinker clenching his teeth sure all men do you know that do you allow them some not many they won t take you out anywhere unless you do she turned her head and looked searchingly at blinker her eyes were as innocent as a child s there was a puzzled look in them as though she did not understand him what s wrong about my meeting fellows she asked wonderingly everything he answered almost savagely why don t you entertain your company in the house where you live is it necessary to pick up tom dick and harry on the streets she kept her absolutely ingenuous eyes upon his if you could see the place where i live you wouldn t ask that i live in brickdust row they call it that because there s red dust from the bricks crumbling over everything i ve lived there for more than four years there s no place to receive company you can t have anybody come to your room what else is there to do a girl has got to meet the men hasn t she yes he said hoarsely a girl has got to meet a has got to meet the men the first time one spoke to me on the street she continued i ran home and cried all night but you get used to it i meet a good many nice fellows at church i go on rainy days and stand in the vestibule until one comes up with an umbrella i wish there was a parlor so i could ask you to call mr blinker are you really sure it isn t smith now the boat landed safely blinker had a confused impression of walking with the girl through quiet crosstown streets until she stopped at a corner and held out her hand i live just one more block over she said thank you for a very pleasant afternoon blinker muttered something and plunged northward till he found a cab a big gray church loomed slowly at his right blinker shook his fist at it through the window i gave you a thousand dollars last week he cried under his breath and she meets them in your very doors there is something wrong there is something wrong at eleven the next day blinker signed his name thirty times with a new pen provided by lawyer oldport now let me go to the woods he said surlily you are not looking well said lawyer oldport the trip will do you good but listen if you will to that little matter of business of which i spoke to you yesterday and also five years ago there are some buildings fifteen in number of which there are new five year leases to be signed your father contemplated a change in the lease provisions but never made it he intended that the parlors of these houses should not be sub let but that the tenants should be allowed to use them for reception rooms these houses are in the shopping district and are mainly tenanted by young working girls as it is they are forced to seek companionship outside this row of red brick blinker interrupted him with a loud discordant laugh brickdust row for an even hundred he cried and i own it have i guessed right the tenants have some such name for it said lawyer oldport blinker arose and jammed his hat down to his eyes do what you please with it he said harshly remodel it burn it raze it to the ground but man it s too late i tell you it s too late it s too late it s too late the making of a new yorker besides many other things raggles was a poet he was called a tramp but that was only an elliptical way of saying that he was a philosopher an artist a traveller a naturalist and a discoverer but most of all he was a poet in all his life he never wrote a line of verse he lived his poetry his odyssey would have been a limerick had it been written but to linger with the primary proposition raggles was a poet raggles s specialty had he been driven to ink and paper would have been sonnets to the cities he studied cities as women study their reflections in mirrors as children study the glue and sawdust of a dislocated doll as the men who write about wild animals study the cages in the zoo a city to raggles was not merely a pile of bricks and mortar peopled by a certain number of inhabitants it was a thing with a soul characteristic and distinct an individual conglomeration of life with its own peculiar essence flavor and feeling two thousand miles to the north and south east and west raggles wandered in poetic fervor taking the cities to his breast he footed it on dusty roads or sped magnificently in freight cars counting time as of no account and when he had found the heart of a city and listened to its secret confession he strayed on restless to another fickle raggles but perhaps he had not met the civic corporation that could engage and hold his critical fancy through the ancient poets we have learned that the cities are feminine so they were to poet raggles and his mind carried a concrete and clear conception of the figure that symbolized and typified each one that he had wooed chicago seemed to swoop down upon him with a breezy suggestion of mrs partington plumes and patchouli and to disturb his rest with a soaring and beautiful song of future promise but raggles would awake to a sense of shivering cold and a haunting impression of ideals lost in a depressing aura of potato salad and fish thus chicago affected him perhaps there is a vagueness and inaccuracy in the description but that is raggles s fault he should have recorded his sensations in magazine poems pittsburg impressed hint as the play of othello performed in the russian language in a railroad station by dockstader s minstrels a royal and generous lady this pittsburg though homely hearty with flushed face washing the dishes in a silk dress and white kid slippers and bidding raggles sit before the roaring fireplace and drink champagne with his pigs feet and fried potatoes new orleans had simply gazed down upon him from a balcony he could see her pensive starry eves and catch the flutter of her fan and that was all only once he came face to face with her it was at dawn when she was flushing the red bricks of the banquette with a pail of water she laughed and hummed a chansonette and filled raggles s shoes with ice cold water allons boston construed herself to the poetic raggles in an erratic and singular way it seemed to him that he had drunk cold tea and that the city was a white cold cloth that had been bound tightly around his brow to spur him to some unknown but tremendous mental effort and after all he came to shovel snow for a livelihood and the cloth becoming wet tightened its knots and could not be removed indefinite and unintelligible ideas you will say but your disapprobation should be tempered with gratitude for these are poets fancies and suppose you had come upon them in verse one day raggles came and laid siege to the heart of the great city of manhattan she was the greatest of all and he wanted to learn her note in the scale to taste and appraise and classify and solve and label her and arrange her with the other cities that had given him up the secret of their individuality and here we cease to be raggles s translator and become his chronicler raggles landed from a ferry boat one morning and walked into the core of the town with the blase air of a cosmopolite he was dressed with care to play the role of an unidentified man no country race class clique union party clan or bowling association could have claimed him his clothing which had been donated to him piece meal by citizens of different height but same number of inches around the heart was not yet as uncomfortable to his figure as those speciments of raiment self measured that are railroaded to you by transcontinental tailors with a suit case suspenders sills handkerchief and pearl studs as a bonus without money as a poet should be but with the ardor of an astronomer discovering a new star in the chorus of the milky way or a man who has seen ink suddenly flow from his fountain pen raggles wandered into the great city late in the afternoon he drew out of the roar and commotion with a look of dumb terror on his countenance he was defeated puzzled discomfited frightened other cities had been to him as long primer to read as country maidens quickly to fathom as send price of subscription with answer rebuses to solve as oyster cocktails to swallow but here was one as cold glittering serene impossible as a four carat diamond in a window to a lover outside fingering damply in his pocket his ribbon counter salary the greetings of the other cities he had known their homespun kindliness their human gamut of rough charity friendly curses garrulous curiosity and easily estimated credulity or indifference this city of manhattan gave him no clue it was walled against him like a river of adamant it flowed past him in the streets never an eye was turned upon him no voice spoke to him his heart yearned for the clap of pittsburg s sooty hand on his shoulder for chicago s menacing but social yawp in his ear for the pale and eleemosynary stare through the bostonian eyeglass even for the precipitate but unmalicious boot toe of louisville or st louis on broadway raggles successful suitor of many cities stood bashful like any country swain for the first time he experienced the poignant humiliation of being ignored and when he tried to reduce this brilliant swiftly changing ice cold city to a formula he failed utterly poet though he was it offered him no color similes no points of comparison no flaw in its polished facets no handle by which he could hold it up and view its shape and structure as he familiarly and often contemptuously had done with other towns the houses were interminable ramparts loopholed for defense the people were bright but bloodless spectres passing in sinister and selfish array the thing that weighed heaviest on raggles s soul and clogged his poet s fancy was the spirit of absolute egotism that seemed to saturate the people as toys are saturated with paint each one that he considered appeared a monster of abominable and insolent conceit humanity was gone from them they were toddling idols of stone and varnish worshipping themselves and greedy for though oblivious of worship from their fellow graven images frozen cruel implacable impervious cut to an identical pattern they hurried on their ways like statues brought by some miracles to motion while soul and feeling lay unaroused in the reluctant marble gradually raggles became conscious of certain types one was an elderly gentleman with a snow white short beard pink unwrinkled face and stony sharp blue eyes attired in the fashion of a gilded youth who seemed to personify the city s wealth ripeness and frigid unconcern another type was a woman tall beautiful clear as a steel engraving goddess like calm clothed like the princesses of old with eyes as coldly blue as the reflection of sunlight on a glacier and another was a by product of this town of marionettes a broad swaggering grim threateningly sedate fellow with a jowl as large as a harvested wheat field the complexion of a baptized infant and the knuckles of a prize fighter this type leaned against cigar signs and viewed the world with frapped contumely a poet is a sensitive creature and raggles soon shrivelled in the bleak embrace of the undecipherable the chill sphinx like ironical illegible unnatural ruthless expression of the city left him downcast and bewildered had it no heart better the woodpile the scolding of vinegar faced housewives at back doors the kindly spleen of bartenders behind provincial free lunch counters the amiable truculence of rural constables the kicks arrests and happy go lucky chances of the other vulgar loud crude cities than this freezing heartlessness raggles summoned his courage and sought alms from the populace unheeding regardless they passed on without the wink of an eyelash to testify that they were conscious of his existence and then he said to himself that this fair but pitiless city of manhattan was without a soul that its inhabitants were manikins moved by wires and springs and that he was alone in a great wilderness raggles started to cross the street there was a blast a roar a hissing and a crash as something struck him and hurled him over and over six yards from where he had been as he was coming down like the stick of a rocket the earth and all the cities thereof turned to a fractured dream raggles opened his eyes first an odor made itself known to him an odor of the earliest spring flowers of paradise and then a hand soft as a falling petal touched his brow bending over him was the woman clothed like the princess of old with blue eyes now soft and humid with human sympathy under his head on the pavement were silks and furs with raggles s hat in his hand and with his face pinker than ever from a vehement burst of oratory against reckless driving stood the elderly gentleman who personified the city s wealth and ripeness from a nearby cafe hurried the by product with the vast jowl and baby complexion bearing a glass full of a crimson fluid that suggested delightful possibilities drink dis sport said the by product holding the glass to raggles s lips hundreds of people huddled around in a moment their faces wearing the deepest concern two flattering and gorgeous policemen got into the circle and pressed back the overplus of samaritans an old lady in a black shawl spoke loudly of camphor a newsboy slipped one of his papers beneath raggles s elbow where it lay on the muddy pavement a brisk young man with a notebook was asking for names a bell clanged importantly and the ambulance cleaned a lane through the crowd a cool surgeon slipped into the midst of affairs how do you feel old man asked the surgeon stooping easily to his task the princess of silks and satins wiped a red drop or two from raggles s brow with a fragrant cobweb me said raggles with a seraphic smile i feel fine he had found the heart of his new city in three days they let him leave his cot for the convalescent ward in the hospital he had been in there an hour when the attendants heard sounds of conflict upon investigation they found that raggles had assaulted and damaged a brother convalescent a glowering transient whom a freight train collision had sent in to be patched up what s all this about inquired the head nurse he was runnin down me town said raggles what town asked the nurse noo york said raggles vanity and some sables when kid brady was sent to the rope by molly mckeever s blue black eyes he withdrew from the stovepipe gang so much for the power of a colleen s blanderin tongue and stubborn true heartedness if you are a man who read this may such an influence be sent you before o clock to morrow if you are a woman may your pomeranian greet you this morning with a cold nose a sign of doghealth and your happiness the stovepipe gang borrowed its name from a sub district of the city called the stovepipe which is a narrow and natural extension of the familiar district known as hell s kitchen the stovepipe strip of town runs along eleventh and twelfth avenues on the river and bends a hard and sooty elbow around little lost homeless dewitt clinton park consider that a stovepipe is an important factor in any kitchen and the situation is analyzed tae chefs in hell s kitchen are many and the stovepipe gang wears the cordon blue the members of this unchartered but widely known brotherhood appeared to pass their time on street corners arrayed like the lilies of the conservatory and busy with nail files and penknives thus displayed as a guarantee of good faith they carried on an innocuous conversation in a word vocabulary to the casual observer as innocent and immaterial as that heard in clubs seven blocks to the east but off exhibition the stovepipes were not mere street corner ornaments addicted to posing and manicuring their serious occupation was the separating of citizens from their coin and valuables preferably this was done by weird and singular tricks without noise or bloodshed but whenever the citizen honored by their attentions refused to impoverish himself gracefully his objections came to be spread finally upon some police station blotter or hospital register the police held the stovepipe gang in perpetual suspicion and respect as the nightingale s liquid note is heard in the deepest shadows so along the stovepipe s dark and narrow confess the whistle for reserves punctures the dull ear of night whenever there was smoke in the stovepipe the tasselled men in blue knew there was fire in hell s kitchen kid brady promised molly to be good kid was the vainest the strongest the wariest and the most successful plotter in the gang therefore the boys were sorry to give him up but they witnessed his fall to a virtuous life with out protest for in the kitchen it is considered neither unmanly nor improper for a guy to do as his girl advises black her eye for love s sake if you will but it is all to the good business to do a thing when she wants you to do it turn off the hydrant said the kid one night when molly tearful besought him to amend his ways i m going to cut out the gang you for mine and the simple life on the side i ll tell you moll i ll get work and in a year we ll get married i ll do it for you we ll get a flat and a flute and a sewing machine and a rubber plant and live as honest as we can oh kid sighed molly wiping the powder off his shoulder with her handkerchief i d rather hear you say that than to own all of new york and we can be happy on so little the kid looked down at his speckless cuffs and shining patent leathers with a suspicion of melancholy it ll hurt hardest in the rags department said he i ve kind of always liked to rig out swell when i could you know how i hate cheap things moll this suit set me back sixty five anything in the wearing apparel line has got to be just so or it s to the misfit parlors for it for mine if i work i won t have so much coin to hand over to the little roan with the big shears never mind kid i ll like you just as much in a blue jumper as i would in a red automobile before the kid had grown large enough to knock out his father he had been compelled to learn the plumber s art so now back to this honorable and useful profession he returned but it was as an assistant that he engaged himself and it is the master plumber and not the assistant who wears diamonds as large as hailstones and looks contemptuously upon the marble colonnades of senator clark s mansion eight months went by as smoothly and surely as though they had elapsed on a theater program the kid worked away at his pipes and solder with no symptoms of backsliding the stovepipe gang continued its piracy on the high avenues cracked policemen s heads held up late travelers invented new methods of peaceful plundering copied fifth avenue s cut of clothes and neckwear fancies and comported itself according to its lawless bylaws but the kid stood firm and faithful to his molly even though the polish was gone from his fingernails and it took him minutes to tie his purple silk ascot so that the worn places would not show one evening he brought a mysterious bundle with him to molly s house open that moll he said in his large quiet way it s for you molly s eager fingers tore off the wrappings she shrieked aloud and in rushed a sprinkling of little mckeevers and ma mckeever dishwashy but an undeniable relative of the late mrs eve again molly shrieked and something dark and long and sinuous flew and enveloped her neck like an anaconda russian sables said the kid pridefully enjoying the sight of molly s round cheek against the clinging fur the real thing they don t grow anything in russia too good for you moll molly plunged her hands into the muff overturned a row of the family infants and flew to the mirror hint for the beauty column to make bright eyes rosy checks and a bewitching smile recipe one set russian sables apply when they were alone molly became aware of a small cake of the ice of common sense floating down the full tide of her happiness you re a bird all right kid she admitted gratefully i never had any furs on before in my life but ain t russian sables awful expensive seems to me i ve heard they were have i ever chucked any bargain sale stuff at you moll asked the kid with calm dignity did you ever notice me leaning on the remnant counter or peering in the window of the five and ten call that scarf and the muff and you won t make any mistake about the price of russian sables the swell goods for me say they look fine on you moll molly hugged the sables to her bosom in rapture and then her smile went away little by little and she looked the kid straight in the eye sadly and steadily he knew what every look of hers meant and he laughed with a faint flush upon his face cut it out he said with affectionate roughness i told you i was done with that i bought em and paid for em all right with my own money out of the money you worked for kid out of a month sure i been saving up let s see saved in eight months kid ah let up said the kid with some heat i had some money when i went to work do you think i ve been holding em up again i told you i d quit they re paid for on the square put em on and come out for a walk molly calmed her doubts sables are soothing proud as a queen she went forth in the streets at the kid s side in all that region of low lying streets russian sables had never been seen before the word sped and doors and windows blossomed with heads eager to see the swell furs kid brady had given his girl all down the street there were oh s and ah s and the reported fabulous sum paid for the sables was passed from lip to lip increasing as it went at her right elbow sauntered the kid with the air of princes work had not diminished his love of pomp and show and his passion for the costly and genuine on a corner they saw a group of the stovepipe gang loafing immaculate they raised their hats to the kid s girl and went on with their calm unaccented palaver three blocks behind the admired couple strolled detective ransom of the central office ransom was the only detective on the force who could walk abroad with safety in the stovepipe district he was fair dealing and unafraid and went there with the hypothesis that the inhabitants were human many liked him and now and then one would tip off to him something that he was looking for what s the excitement down the street asked ransom of a pale youth in a red sweater dey re out rubberin at a set of buffalo robes kid brady staked his girl to

the strolling couple on an empty street near the river bank he touched the kid s arm from behind let me see you a moment brady he said quietly his eye rested for a second on the long fur scarf thrown

turn em over moll but they ain t too good for you if they cost a million molly with anguish in her face hung upon the kid s arm oh kiddy you ve broke my heart she said i was so proud of you and now

gouple of young vools said policeman kohen to ransom come on away the social triangle at the stroke of six ikey snigglefritz laid down his goose ikey was a tailor s apprentice are there tailor s apprentices nowadays at any rate ikey toiled and snipped and basted and pressed and patched and sponged all day in the steamy fetor of a tailor shop but when work was done ikey hitched his wagon to such stars as his firmament let shine it was saturday night and the boss laid twelve begrimed and begrudged dollars in his hand ikey dabbled discreetly in water donned coat hat and collar with its frazzled tie and chalcedony pin and set forth in pursuit of his ideals for each of us when our day s work is done must seek our ideal whether it be love or pinochle or lobster a la newburg or the sweet silence of the musty bookshelves behold ikey as he ambles up the street beneath the roaring el between the rows of reeking sweatshops pallid stooping insignificant squalid doomed to exist forever in penury of body and mind yet as he swings his cheap cane and projects the noisome inhalations from his cigarette you perceive that he nurtures in his narrow bosom the bacillus of society ikey s legs carried him to and into that famous place of entertainment known as the cafe maginnis famous because it was the rendezvous of billy mcmahan the greatest man the most wonderful man ikey thought that the world had ever produced billy mcmahan was the district leader upon him the tiger purred and his hand held manna to scatter now as ikey entered mcmahan stood flushed and triumphant and mighty the centre of a huzzaing concourse of his lieutenants and constituents it seems there had been an election a signal victory had been won the city had been swept back into line by a resistless besom of ballots ikey slunk along the bar and gazed breath quickened at his idol how magnificent was billy mcmahan with his great smooth laughing face his gray eye shrewd as a chicken hawk s his diamond ring his voice like a bugle call his prince s air his plump and active roll of money his clarion call to friend and comrade oh what a king of men he was how he obscured his lieutenants though they themselves loomed large and serious blue of chin and important of mien with hands buried deep in the pockets of their short overcoats but billy oh what small avail are words to paint for you his glory as seen by ikey snigglefritz the cafe maginnis rang to the note of victory the white coated bartenders threw themselves featfully upon bottle cork and glass from a score of clear havanas the air received its paradox of clouds the leal and the hopeful shook billy mcmahan s hand and there was born suddenly in the worshipful soul of ikey snigglefritz an audacious thrilling impulse he stepped forward into the little cleared space in which majesty moved and held out his hand billy mcmahan grasped it unhesitatingly shook it and smiled made mad now by the gods who were about to destroy him ikey threw away his scabbard and charged upon olympus have a drink with me billy he said familiarly you and your friends don t mind if i do old man said the great leader just to keep the ball rolling the last spark of ikey s reason fled wine he called to the bartender waving a trembling hand the corks of three bottles were drawn the champagne bubbled in the long row of glasses set upon the bar billy mcmahan took his and nodded with his beaming smile at ikey the lieutenants and satellites took theirs and growled here s to you ikey took his nectar in delirium all drank ikey threw his week s wages in a crumpled roll upon the bar c rect said the bartender smoothing the twelve one dollar notes the crowd surged around billy mcmahan again some one was telling how brannigan fixed em over in the eleventh ikey leaned against the bar a while and then went out he went down hester street and up chrystie and down delancey to where he lived and there his women folk a bibulous mother and three dingy sisters pounced upon him for his wages and at his confession they shrieked and objurgated him in the pithy rhetoric of the locality but even as they plucked at him and struck him ikey remained in his ecstatic trance of joy his head was in the clouds the star was drawing his wagon compared with what he had achieved the loss of wages and the bray of women s tongues were slight affairs he had shaken the hand of billy mcmahan billy mcmahan had a wife and upon her visiting cards was engraved the name mrs william darragh mcmahan and there was a certain vexation attendant upon these cards for small as they were there were houses in which they could not be inserted billy mcmahan was a dictator in politics a four walled tower in business a mogul dreaded loved and obeyed among his own people he was growing rich the daily papers had a dozen men on his trail to chronicle his every word of wisdom he had been honored in caricature holding the tiger cringing in leash but the heart of billy was sometimes sore within him there was a race of men from which he stood apart but that he viewed with the eye of moses looking over into the promised land he too had ideals even as had ikey snigglefritz and sometimes hopeless of attaining them his own solid success was as dust and ashes in his mouth and mrs william darragh mcmahan wore a look of discontent upon her plump but pretty face and the very rustle of her silks seemed a sigh there was a brave and conspicuous assemblage in the dining saloon of a noted hostelry where fashion loves to display her charms at one table sat billy mcmahan and his wife mostly silent they were but the accessories they enjoyed little needed the indorsement of speech mrs mcmahan s diamonds were outshone by few in the room the waiter bore the costliest brands of wine to their table in evening dress with an expression of gloom upon his smooth and massive countenance you would look in vain for a more striking figure than billy s four tables away sat alone a tall slender man about thirty with thoughtful melancholy eyes a van dyke beard and peculiarly white thin hands he was dining on filet mignon dry toast and apollinaris that man was cortlandt van duyckink a man worth eighty millions who inherited and held a sacred seat in the exclusive inner circle of society billy mcmahan spoke to no one around him because he knew no one van duyckink kept his eyes on his plate because he knew that every one present was hungry to catch his he could bestow knighthood and prestige by a nod and he was chary of creating a too extensive nobility and then billy mcmahan conceived and accomplished the most startling and audacious act of his life he rose deliberately and walked over to cortlandt van duyckink s table and held out his hand say mr van duyckink he said i ve heard you was talking about starting some reforms among the poor people down in my district i m mcmahan you know say now if that s straight i ll do all i can to help you and what i says goes in that neck of the woods don t it oh say i rather guess it does van duyckink s rather sombre eyes lighted up he rose to his lank height and grasped billy mcmahan s hand thank you mr mcmahan he said in his deep serious tones i have been thinking of doing some work of that sort i shall be glad of your assistance it pleases me to have become acquainted with you billy walked back to his seat his shoulder was tingling from the accolade bestowed by royalty a hundred eyes were now turned upon him in envy and new admiration mrs william darragh mcmahan trembled with ecstasy so that her diamonds smote the eye almost with pain and now it was apparent that at many tables there were those who suddenly remembered that they enjoyed mr mcmahan s acquaintance he saw smiles and bows about him he became enveloped in the aura of dizzy greatness his campaign coolness deserted him wine for that gang he commanded the waiter pointing with his finger wine over there wine to those three gents by that green bush tell em it s on me d n it wine for everybody the waiter ventured to whisper that it was perhaps inexpedient to carry out the order in consideration of the dignity of the house and its custom all right said billy if it s against the rules i wonder if twould do to send my friend van duyckink a bottle no well it ll flow all right at the caffy to night just the same it ll be rubber boots for anybody who comes in there any time up to a m billy mcmahan was happy he had shaken the hand of cortlandt van duyckink the big pale gray auto with its shining metal work looked out of place moving slowly among the push carts and trash heaps on the lower east side so did cortlandt van duyckink with his aristocratic face and white thin hands as he steered carefully between the groups of ragged scurrying youngsters in the streets and so did miss constance schuyler with her dim ascetic beauty seated at his side oh cortlandt she breathed isn t it sad that human beings have to live in such wretchedness and poverty and you how noble it is of you to think of them to give your time and money to improve their condition van duyckink turned his solemn eyes upon her it is little he said sadly that i can do the question is a large one and belongs to society but even individual effort is not thrown away look constance on this street i have arranged to build soup kitchens where no one who is hungry will be turned away and down this other street are the old buildings that i shall cause to be torn down and there erect others in place of those death traps of fire and disease down delancey slowly crept the pale gray auto away from it toddled coveys of wondering tangle haired barefooted unwashed children it stopped before a crazy brick structure foul and awry van duyckink alighted to examine at a better perspective one of the leaning walls down the steps of the building came a young man who seemed to epitomize its degradation squalor and infelicity a narrow chested pale unsavory young man puffing at a cigarette obeying a sudden impulse van duyckink stepped out and warmly grasped the hand of what seemed to him a living rebuke i want to know you people he said sincerely i am going to help you as much as i can we shall be friends as the auto crept carefully away cortlandt van duyckink felt an unaccustomed glow about his heart he was near to being a happy man he had shaken the hand of ikey snigglefritz the purple dress we are to consider the shade known as purple it is a color justly in repute among the sons and daughters of man emperors claim it for their especial dye good fellows everywhere seek to bring their noses to the genial hue that follows the commingling of the red and blue we say of princes that they are born to the purple and no doubt they are for the colic tinges their faces with the royal tint equally with the snub nosed countenance of a woodchopper s brat all women love it when it is the fashion and now purple is being worn you notice it on the streets of course other colors are quite stylish as well in fact i saw a lovely thing the other day in olive green albatross with a triple lapped flounce skirt trimmed with insert squares of silk and a draped fichu of lace opening over a shirred vest and double puff sleeves with a lace band holding two gathered frills but you see lots of purple too oh yes you do just take a walk down twenty third street any afternoon therefore maida the girl with the big brown eyes and cinnamon colored hair in the bee hive store said to grace the girl with the rhinestone brooch and peppermint pepsin flavor to her speech i m going to have a purple dress a tailor made purple dress for thanksgiving oh are you said grace putting away some gloves into the box well it s me for red you see more red on fifth avenue and the men all seem to like it i like purple best said maida and old schlegel has promised to make it for it s going to be lovely i m going to have a plaited skirt and a blouse coat trimmed with a band of galloon under a white cloth collar with two rows of sly boots said grace with an educated wink soutache braid over a surpliced white vest and a plaited basque and sly boots sly boots repeated grace plaited gigot sleeves with a drawn velvet ribbon over an inside cuff what do you mean by saying that you think mr ramsay likes purple i heard him say yesterday he thought some of the dark shades of red were stunning i don t care said maida i prefer purple and them that don t like it can just take the other side of the street which suggests the thought that after all the followers of purple may be subject to slight delusions danger is near when a maiden thinks she can wear purple regardless of complexions and opinions and when emperors think their purple robes will wear forever maida had saved after eight months of economy and this had bought the goods for the purple dress and paid schlegel on the making of it on the day before thanksgiving she would have just enough to pay the remaining and then for a holiday in a new dress can earth offer anything more enchanting old bachman the proprietor of the bee hive store always gave a thanksgiving dinner to his employees on every one of the subsequent days excusing sundays he would remind them of the joys of the past banquet and the hopes of the coming ones thus inciting them to increased enthusiasm in work the dinner was given in the store on one of the long tables in the middle of the room they tacked wrapping paper over the front windows and the turkeys and other good things were brought in the back way from the restaurant on the corner you will perceive that the bee hive was not a fashionable department store with escalators and pompadours it was almost small enough to be called an emporium and you could actually go in there and get waited on and walk out again and always at the thanksgiving dinners mr ramsay oh bother i should have mentioned mr ramsay first of all he is more important than purple or green or even the red cranberry sauce mr ramsay was the head clerk and as far as i am concerned i am for him he never pinched the girls arms when he passed them in dark corners of the store and when he told them stories when business was dull and the girls giggled and said oh pshaw it wasn t g bernard they meant at all besides being a gentleman mr ramsay was queer and original in other ways he was a health crank and believed that people should never eat anything that was good for them he was violently opposed to anybody being comfortable and coming in out of snow storms or wearing overshoes or taking medicine or coddling themselves in any way every one of the ten girls in the store had little pork chop and fried onion dreams every night of becoming mrs ramsay for next year old bachman was going to take him in for a partner and each one of them knew that if she should catch him she would knock those cranky health notions of his sky high before the wedding cake indigestion was over mr ramsay was master of ceremonies at the dinners always they had two italians in to play a violin and harp and had a little dance in the store and here were two dresses being conceived to charm ramsay one purple and the other red of course the other eight girls were going to have dresses too but they didn t count very likely they d wear some shirt waist and black skirt affairs nothing as resplendent as purple or red grace had saved her money too she was going to buy her dress ready made oh what s the use of bothering with a tailor when you ve got a figger it s easy to get a fit the ready made are intended for a perfect figger except i have to have em all taken in at the waist the average figger is so large waisted the night before thanksgiving came maida hurried home keen and bright with the thoughts of the blessed morrow her thoughts were of purple but they were white themselves the joyous enthusiasm of the young for the pleasures that youth must have or wither she knew purple would become her and for the thousandth time she tried to assure herself that it was purple mr ramsay said he liked and not red she was going home first to get the wrapped in a piece of tissue paper in the bottom drawer of her dresser and then she was going to pay schlegel and take the dress home herself grace lived in the same house she occupied the hall room above maida s at home maida found clamor and confusion the landlady s tongue clattering sourly in the halls like a churn dasher dabbing in buttermilk and then grace come down to her room crying with eyes as red as any dress she says i ve got to get out said grace the old beast because i owe her she s put my trunk in the hall and locked the door i can t go anywhere else i haven t got a cent of money you had some yesterday said maida i paid it on my dress said grace i thought she d wait till next week for the rent sniffle sniffle sob sniffle out came out it had to come maida s you blessed darling cried grace now a rainbow instead of sunset i ll pay the mean old thing and then i m going to try on my dress i think it s heavenly come up and look at it i ll pay the money back a dollar a week honest i will thanksgiving the dinner was to be at noon at a quarter to twelve grace switched into maida s room yes she looked charming red was her color maida sat by the window in her old cheviot skirt and blue waist darning a st oh doing fancy work why goodness me ain t you dressed yet shrilled the red one how does it fit in the back don t you think these velvet tabs look awful swell why ain t you dressed maida my dress didn t get finished in time said maida i m not going to the dinner that s too bad why i m awfully sorry maida why don t you put on anything and come along it s just the store folks you know and they won t mind i was set on my purple said maida if i can t have it i won t go at all don t bother about me run along or you ll be late you look awful nice in red at her window maida sat through the long morning and past the time of the dinner at the store in her mind she could hear the girls shrieking over a pull bone could hear old bachman s roar over his own deeply concealed jokes could see the diamonds of fat mrs bachman who came to the store only on thanksgiving days could see mr ramsay moving about alert kindly looking to the comfort of all at four in the afternoon with an expressionless face and a lifeless air she slowly made her way to schlegel s shop and told him she could not pay the due on the dress gott cried schlegel angrily for what do you look so glum take him away he is ready pay me some time haf i not seen you pass mine shop every day in two years if i make clothes is it that i do not know how to read beoples because you will pay me some time when you can take him away he is made goot and if you look bretty in him all right so pay me when you can maida breathed a millionth part of the thanks in her heart and hurried away with her dress as she left the shop a smart dash of rain struck upon her face she smiled and did not feel it ladies who shop in carriages you do not understand girls whose wardrobes are charged to the old man s account you cannot begin to comprehend you could not understand why maida did not feel the cold dash of the thanksgiving rain at five o clock she went out upon the street wearing her purple dress the rain had increased and it beat down upon her in a steady wind blown pour people were scurrying home and to cars with close held umbrellas and tight buttoned raincoats many of them turned their heads to marvel at this beautiful serene happy eyed girl in the purple dress walking through the storm as though she were strolling in a garden under summer skies i say you do not understand it ladies of the full purse and varied wardrobe you do not know what it is to live with a perpetual longing for pretty things to starve eight months in order to bring a purple dress and a holiday together what difference if it rained hailed blew snowed cycloned maida had no umbrella nor overshoes she had her purple dress and she walked abroad let the elements do their worst a starved heart must have one crumb during a year the rain ran down and dripped from her fingers some one turned a corner and blocked her way she looked up into mr ramsay s eyes sparkling with admiration and interest why miss maida said he you look simply magnificent in your new dress i was greatly disappointed not to see you at our dinner and of all the girls i ever knew you show the greatest sense and intelligence there is nothing more healthful and invigorating than braving the weather as you are doing may i walk with you and maida blushed and sneezed the foreign policy of company john byrnes hose cart driver of engine company no was afflicted with what his comrades called japanits byrnes had a war map spread permanently upon a table in the second story of the engine house and he could explain to you at any hour of the day or night the exact positions conditions and intentions of both the russian and japanese armies he had little clusters of pins stuck in the map which represented the opposing forces and these be moved about from day to day in conformity with the war news in the daily papers wherever the japs won a victory john byrnes would shift his pins and then he would execute a war dance of delight and the other firemen would hear him yell go it you blamed little sawed off huckleberry eyed monkey faced hot tamales eat em up you little sleight o hand bow legged bull terriers give em another of them yalu looloos and you ll eat rice in st petersburg talk about your russians say wouldn t they give you a painsky when it comes to a scrapovitch not even on the fair island of nippon was there a more enthusiastic champion of the mikado s men supporters of the russian cause did well to keep clear of engine house no sometimes all thoughts of the japs left john byrnes s head that was when the alarm of fire had sounded and he was strapped in his driver s seat on the swaying cart guilding erebus and joe the finest team in the whole department according to the crew of of all the codes adopted by man for regulating his actions toward his fellow mortals the greatest are these the code of king arthur s knights of the round table the constitution of the united states and the unwritten rules of the new york fire department the round table methods are no longer practicable since the invention of street cars and breach of promise suits and our constitution is being found more and more unconstitutional every day so the code of our firemen must be considered in the lead with the golden rule and jeffries s new punch trying for place and show the constitution says that one man is as good as another but the fire department says he is better this is a too generous theory but the law will not tallow itself to be construed otherwise all of which comes perilously near to being a paradox and commends itself to the attention of the s p c a one of the transatlantic liners dumped out at ellis island a lump of protozoa which was expected to evolve into an american citizen a steward kicked him down the gangway a doctor pounced upon his eyes like a raven seeking for trachoma or ophthalmia he was hustled ashore and ejected into the city in the name of liberty perhaps theoretically thus inoculating against kingocracy with a drop of its own virus this hypodermic injection of europeanism wandered happily into the veins of the city with the broad grin of a pleased child it was not burdened with baggage cares or ambitions its body was lithely built and clothed in a sort of foreign fustian its face was brightly vacant with a small flat nose and was mostly covered by a thick ragged curling beard like the coat of a spaniel in the pocket of the imported thing were a few coins denarii sendi kopecks pfennigs pilasters whatever the financial nomenclature of his unknown country nay have been prattling to himself always broadly grinning pleased by the roar and movement of the barbarous city into which the steamship cut rates had shunted him the alien strayed away from the sea which he hated as far as the district covered by engine company no light as a cork he was kept bobbing along by the human tide the cruelest atom in all the silt of the stream that emptied into the reservoir of liberty while crossing third avenue he slowed his steps enchanted by the thunder of the elevated trains above him and the soothing crash of the wheels on the cobbles and then there was a new delightful chord in the uproar the musical clanging of a gong and a great shining juggernaut belching fire and smoke that people were hurrying to see this beautiful thing entrancing to the eye dashed past and the protoplasmic immigrant stepped into the wake of it with his broad enraptured uncomprehending grin and so stepping stepped into the path of no s flying hose cart with john byrnes gripping with arms of steel the reins over the plunging backs of erebus and joe the unwritten constitutional code of the fireman has no exceptions or amendments it is a simple thing as simple as the rule of three there was the heedless unit in the right of way there was the hose cart and the iron pillar of the elevated railroad john byrnes swung all his weight and muscle on the left rein the team and cart swerved that way and crashed like a torpedo into the pillar the men on the cart went flying like skittles the driver s strap burst the pillar rang with the shock and john byrnes fell on the car track with a broken shoulder twenty feet away while erebus beautiful raven black best loved erebus lay whickering in his harness with a broken leg in consideration for the feelings of engine company no the details will be lightly touched the company does not like to be reminded of that day there was a great crowd and hurry calls were sent in and while the ambulance gong was clearing the way the men of no heard the crack of the s p c a agent s pistol and turned their heads away not daring to look toward erebus again when the firemen got back to the engine house they found that one of them was dragging by the collar the cause of their desolation and grief they set it in the middle of the floor and gathered grimly about it through its whiskers the calamitous object chattered effervescently and waved its hands sounds like a seidlitz powder said mike dowling disgustedly and it makes me sicker than one call that a man that hoss was worth a steamer full of such two legged animals it s a immigrant that s what it is look at the doctor s chalk mark on its coat said reilly the desk man it s just landed it must be a kind of a dago or a hun or one of them finns i guess that s the kind of truck that europe unloads onto us think of a thing like that getting in the way and laying john up in hospital and spoiling the best fire team in the city groaned another fireman it ought to be taken down to the dock and drowned somebody go around and get sloviski suggested the engine driver and let s see what nation is responsible for this conglomeration of hair and head noises sloviski kept a delicatessen store around the corner on third avenue and was reputed to be a linguist one of the men fetched him a fat cringing man with a discursive eye and the odors of many kinds of meats upon him take a whirl at this importation with your jaw breakers sloviski requested mike dowling we can t quite figure out whether he s from the hackensack bottoms or hongkong on the ganges sloviski addressed the stranger in several dialects that ranged in rhythm and cadence from the sounds produced by a tonsilitis gargle to the opening of a can of tomatoes with a pair of scissors the immigrant replied in accents resembling the uncorking of a bottle of ginger ale i have you his name reported sloviski you shall not pronounce it writing of it in paper is better they gave him paper and he wrote demetre svangvsk looks like short hand said the desk man he speaks some language continued the interpreter wiping his forehead of austria and mixed with a little turkish and den he have some magyar words and a polish or two and many like the roumanian but not without talk of one tribe in bessarabia i do not him quite understand would you call him a dago or a polocker or what asked mike frowning at the polyglot description he is a answered sloviski he is a i dink he come from i dink he is a fool he concluded impatient at his linguistic failure and if you pleases i will go back at mine delicatessen whatever he is he s a bird said mike dowling and you want to watch him fly taking by the wing the alien fowl that had fluttered into the nest of liberty mike led him to the door of the engine house and bestowed upon him a kick hearty enough to convey the entire animus of company demetre svangvsk hustled away down the sidewalk turning once to show his ineradicable grin to the aggrieved firemen in three weeks john byrnes was back at his post from the hospital with great gusto he proceeded to bring his war map up to date my money on the japs every time he declared why look at them russians they re nothing but wolves wipe em out i say and the little old jiu jitsu gang are just the cherry blossoms to do the trick and don t you forget it the second day after byrnes s reappearance came demetre svangvsk the unidentified to the engine house with a broader grin than ever he managed to convey the idea that he wished to congratulate the hose cart driver on his recovery and to apologize for having caused the accident this he accomplished by so many extravagant gestures and explosive noises that the company was diverted for half an hour then they kicked him out again and on the next day he came back grinning how or where he lived no one knew and then john byrnes s nine year old son chris who brought him convalescent delicacies from home to eat took a fancy to svangvsk and they allowed him to loaf about the door of the engine house occasionally one afternoon the big drab automobile of the deputy fire commissioner buzzed up to the door of no and the deputy stepped inside for an informal inspection the men kicked svangvsk out a little harder than usual and proudly escorted the deputy around in which everything shone like my lady s mirror the deputy respected the sorrow of the company concerning the loss of erebus and he had come to promise it another mate for joe that would do him credit so they let joe out of his stall and showed the deputy how deserving he was of the finest mate that could be in horsedom while they were circling around joe confabbing chris climbed into the deputy s auto and threw the power full on the men heard a monster puffing and a shriek from the lad and sprang out too late the big auto shot away luckily taking a straight course down the street the boy knew nothing of its machinery he sat clutching the cushions and howling with the power on nothing could have stopped that auto except a brick house and there was nothing for chris to gain by such a stoppage demetre svangvsk was just coming in again with a grin for another kick when chris played his merry little prank while the others sprang for the door demetre sprang for joe he glided upon the horse s bare back like a snake and shouted something at him like the crack of a dozen whips one of the firemen afterward swore that joe answered him back in the same language ten seconds after the auto started the big horse was eating up the asphalt behind it like a strip of macaroni some people two blocks and a half away saw the rescue they said that the auto was nothing but a drab noise with a black speck in the middle of it for chris when a big bay horse with a lizard lying on its back cantered up alongside of it and the lizard reached over and picked the black speck out of the noise only fifteen minutes after svangvsk s last kicking at the hands or rather the feet of engine company no he rode joe back through the door with the boy safe but acutely conscious of the licking he was going to receive svangvsk slipped to the floor leaned his head against joe s and made a noise like a clucking hen joe nodded and whistled loudly through his nostrils putting to shame the knowledge of sloviski of the delicatessen john byrnes walked up to svangvsk who grinned expecting to be kicked byrnes gripped the outlander so strongly by the hand that demetre grinned anyhow conceiving it to be a new form of punishment the heathen rides like a cossack remarked a fireman who had seen a wild west show they re the greatest riders in the world the word seemed to electrify svangvsk he grinned wider than ever yas yas me cossack he spluttered striking his chest cossack repeated john byrnes thoughtfully ain t that a kind of a russian they re one of the russian tribes sure said the desk man who read books between fire alarms just then alderman foley who was on his way home and did not know of the runaway stopped at the door of the engine house and called to byrnes hello there jimmy me boy how s the war coming along japs still got the bear on the trot have they oh i don t know said john byrnes argumentatively them japs haven t got any walkover you wait till kuropatkin gets a good whack at em and they won t be knee high to a puddle ducksky the lost blend since the bar has been blessed by the clergy and cocktails open the dinners of the elect one may speak of the saloon teetotalers need not listen if they choose there is always the slot restaurant where a dime dropped into the cold bouillon aperture will bring forth a dry martini con lantry worked on the sober side of the bar in kenealy s cafe you and i stood one legged like geese on the other side and went into voluntary liquidation with our week s wages opposite danced con clean temperate clear headed polite white jacketed punctual trustworthy young responsible and took our money the saloon whether blessed or cursed stood in one of those little places which are parallelograms instead of streets and inhabited by laundries decayed knickerbocker families and bohemians who have nothing to do with either over the cafe lived kenealy and his family his daughter katherine had eyes of dark irish but why should you be told be content with your geraldine or your eliza ann for con dreamed of her and when she called softly at the foot of the back stairs for the pitcher of beer for dinner his heart went up and down like a milk punch in the shaker orderly and fit are the rules of romance and if you hurl the last shilling of your fortune upon the bar for whiskey the bartender shall take it and marry his boss s daughter and good will grow out of it but not so con for in the presence of woman he was tongue tied and scarlet he who would quell with his eye the sonorous youth whom the claret punch made loquacious or smash with lemon squeezer the obstreperous or hurl gutterward the cantankerous without a wrinkle coming to his white lawn tie when he stood before woman he was voiceless incoherent stuttering buried beneath a hot avalanche of bashfulness and misery what then was he before katherine a trembler with no word to say for himself a stone without blarney the dumbest lover that ever babbled of the weather in the presence of his divinity there came to kenealy s two sunburned men riley and mcquirk they had conference with kenealy and then they took possession of a back room which they filled with bottles and siphons and jugs and druggist s measuring glasses all the appurtenances and liquids of a saloon were there but they dispensed no drinks all day long the two sweltered in there pouring and mixing unknown brews and decoctions from the liquors in their store riley had the education and he figured on reams of paper reducing gallons to ounces and quarts to fluid drams mcquirk a morose man with a red eye dashed each unsuccessful completed mixture into the waste pipes with curses gentle husky and deep they labored heavily and untiringly to achieve some mysterious solution like two alchemists striving to resolve gold from the elements into this back room one evening when his watch was done sauntered con his professional curiosity had been stirred by these occult bartenders at whose bar none drank and who daily drew upon kenealy s store of liquors to follow their consuming and fruitless experiments down the back stairs came katherine with her smile like sunrise on gweebarra bay good evening mr lantry says she and what is the news to day if you please it looks like r rain stammered the shy one backing to the wall it couldn t do better said katherine i m thinking there s nothing the worse off for a little water in the back room riley and mcquirk toiled like bearded witches over their strange compounds from fifty bottles they drew liquids carefully measured after riley s figures and shook the whole together in a great glass vessel then mcquirk would dash it out with gloomy profanity and they would begin again sit down said riley to con and i ll tell you last summer me and tim concludes that an american bar in this nation of nicaragua would pay there was a town on the coast where there s nothing to eat but quinine and nothing to drink but rum the natives and foreigners lay down with chills and get up with fevers and a good mixed drink is nature s remedy for all such tropical inconveniences so we lays in a fine stock of wet goods in new york and bar fixtures and glassware and we sails for that santa palma town on a lime steamer on the way me and tim sees flying fish and plays seven up with the captain and steward and already begins to feel like the high ball kings of the tropics of capricorn when we gets in five hours of the country that we was going to introduce to long drinks and short change the captain calls us over to the starboard binnacle and recollects a few things i forgot to tell you boys says he that nicaragua slapped an import duty of per cent ad valorem on all bottled goods last month the president took a bottle of cincinnati hair tonic by mistake for tobasco sauce and he s getting even barrelled goods is free sorry you didn t mention it sooner says we and we bought two forty two gallon casks from the captain and opened every bottle we had and dumped the stuff all together in the casks that per cent would have ruined us so we took the chances on making that cocktail rather than throw the stud away well when we landed we tapped one of the barrels the mixture was something heartrending it was the color of a plate of bowery pea soup and it tasted like one of those coffee substitutes your aunt makes you take for the heart trouble you get by picking losers we gave a nigger four fingers of it to try it and he lay under a cocoanut tree three days beating the sand with his heels and refused to sign a testimonial but the other barrel say bartender did you ever put on a straw hat with a yellow band around it and go up in a balloon with a pretty girl with in your pocket all at the same time that s what thirty drops of it would make you feel like with two fingers of it inside you you would bury your face in your hands and cry because there wasn t anything more worth while around for you to lick than little jim jeffries yes sir the stuff in that second barrel was distilled elixir of battle money and high life it was the color of gold and as clear as glass and it shone after dark like the sunshine was still in it a thousand years from now you ll get a drink like that across the bar well we started up business with that one line of drinks and it was enough the piebald gentry of that country stuck to it like a hive of bees if that barrel had lasted that country would have become the greatest on earth when we opened up of mornings we had a line of generals and colonels and ex presidents and revolutionists a block long waiting to be served we started in at cents silver a drink the last ten gallons went easy at a gulp it was wonderful stuff it gave a man courage and ambition and nerve to do anything at the same time he didn t care whether his money was tainted or fresh from the ice trust when that barrel was half gone nicaragua had repudiated the national debt removed the duty on cigarettes and was about to declare war on the united states and england twas by accident we discovered this king of drinks and twill be by good luck if we strike it again for ten months we ve been trying small lots at a time we ve mixed barrels of all the harmful ingredients known to the profession of drinking ye could have stocked ten bars with the whiskies brandies cordials bitters gins and wines me and tim have wasted a glorious drink like that to be denied to the world tis a sorrow and a loss of money the united states as a nation would welcome a drink of that sort and pay for it all the while mcquirk lead been carefully measuring and pouring together small quantities of various spirits as riley called them from his latest pencilled prescription the completed mixture was of a vile mottled chocolate color mcquirk tasted it and hurled it with appropriate epithets into the waste sink tis a strange story even if true said con i ll be going now along to my supper take a drink said riley we ve all kinds except the lost blend i never drink said con anything stronger than water i am just after meeting miss katherine by the stairs she said a true word there s not anything says she but is better off for a little water when con had left them riley almost felled mcquirk by a blow on the back did ye hear that he shouted two fools are we the six dozen bottles of pollinaris we had on the slip ye opened them yourself which barrel did ye pour them in which barrel ye mudhead i mind said mcquirk slowly twas in the second barrel we opened i mind the blue piece of paper pasted on the side of it we ve got it now cried riley twas that we lacked tis the water that does the trick everything else we had right hurry man and get two bottles of pollinaris from the bar while i figure out the proportionments with me pencil an hour later con strolled down the sidewalk toward kenealy s cafe thus faithful employees haunt during their recreation hours the vicinity where they labor drawn by some mysterious attraction a police patrol wagon stood at the side door three able cops were half carrying half hustling riley and mcquirk up its rear steps the eyes and faces of each bore the bruises and cuts of sanguinary and assiduous conflict yet they whooped with strange joy and directed upon the police the feeble remnants of their pugnacious madness began fighting each other in the back room explained kenealy to con and singing that was worse smashed everything pretty much up but they re good men they ll pay for everything trying to invent some new kind of cocktail they was i ll see they come out all right in the morning con sauntered into the back room to view the battlefield as he went through the hall katherine was just coming down the stairs good evening again mr lantry said she and is there no news from the weather yet still threatens r rain said con slipping past with red in his smooth pale cheek riley and mcquirk had indeed waged a great and friendly battle broken bottles and glasses were everywhere the room was full of alcohol fumes the floor was variegated with spirituous puddles on the table stood a ounce glass graduated measure in the bottom of it were two tablespoonfuls of liquid a bright golden liquid that seemed to hold the sunshine a prisoner in its auriferous depths con smelled it he tasted it he drank it as he returned through the hall katherine was just going up the stairs no news yet mr lantry she asked with her teasing laugh con lifted her clear from the floor and held her there the news is he said that we re to be married put me down sir she cried indignantly or i will oh con where oh wherever did you get the nerve to say it a harlem tragedy harlem mrs fink had dropped into mrs cassidy s flat one flight below ain t it a beaut said mrs cassidy she turned her face proudly for her friend mrs fink to see one eye was nearly closed with a great greenish purple bruise around it her lip was cut and bleeding a little and there were red finger marks on each side of her neck my husband wouldn t ever think of doing that to me said mrs fink concealing her envy i wouldn t have a man declared mrs cassidy that didn t beat me up at least once a week shows he thinks something of you say but that last dose jack gave me wasn t no homeopathic one i can see stars yet but he ll be the sweetest man in town for the rest of the week to make up for it this eye is good for theater tickets and a silk shirt waist at the very least i should hope said mrs fink assuming complacency that mr fink is too much of a gentleman ever to raise his hand against me oh go on maggie said mrs cassidy laughing and applying witch hazel you re only jealous your old man is too frapped and slow to ever give you a punch he just sits down and practises physical culture with a newspaper when he comes home now ain t that the truth mr fink certainly peruses of the papers when he comes home acknowledged mrs fink with a toss of her head but he certainly don t ever make no steve o donnell out of me just to amuse himself that s a sure thing mrs cassidy laughed the contented laugh of the guarded and happy matron with the air of cornelia exhibiting her jewels she drew down the collar of her kimono and revealed another treasured bruise maroon colored edged with olive and orange a bruise now nearly well but still to memory dear mrs fink capitulated the formal light in her eye softened to envious admiration she and mrs cassidy had been chums in the downtown paper box factory before they had married one year before now she and her man occupied the flat above mame and her man therefore she could not put on airs with mame don t it hurt when he soaks you asked mrs fink curiously hurt mrs cassidy gave a soprano scream of delight well say did you ever have a brick house fall on you well that s just the way it feels just like when they re digging you out of the ruins jack s got a left that spells two matinees and a new pair of oxfords and his right well it takes a trip to coney and six pairs of openwork silk lisle threads to make that good but what does he beat you for inquired mrs fink with wide open eyes silly said mrs cassidy indulgently why because he s full it s generally on saturday nights but what cause do you give him persisted the seeker after knowledge why didn t i marry him jack comes in tanked up and i m here ain t i who else has he got a right to beat i d just like to catch him once beating anybody else sometimes it s because supper ain t ready and sometimes it s because it is jack ain t particular about causes he just lushes till he remembers he s married and then he makes for home and does me up saturday nights i just move the furniture with sharp corners out of the way so i won t cut my head when he gets his work in he s got a left swing that jars you sometimes i take the count in the first round but when i feel like having a good time during the week or want some new rags i come up again for more punishment that s what i done last night jack knows i ve been wanting a black silk waist for a month and i didn t think just one black eye would bring it tell you what mag i ll bet you the ice cream he brings it to night mrs fink was thinking deeply my mart she said never hit me a lick in his life it s just like you said mame he comes in grouchy and ain t got a word to say he never takes me out anywhere he s a chair warmer at home for fair he buys me things but he looks so glum about it that i never appreciate em mrs cassidy slipped an arm around her chum you poor thing she said but everybody can t have a husband like jack marriage wouldn t be no failure if they was all like him these discontented wives you hear about what they need is a man to come home and kick their slats in once a week and then make it up in kisses and chocolate creams that d give em some interest in life what i want is a masterful man that slugs you when he s jagged and hugs you when he ain t jagged preserve me from the man that ain t got the sand to do neither mrs fink sighed the hallways were suddenly filled with sound the door flew open at the kick of mr cassidy his arms were occupied with bundles mame flew and hung about his neck her sound eye sparkled with the love light that shines in the eye of the maori maid when she recovers consciousness in the hut of the wooer who has stunned and dragged her there hello old girl shouted mr cassidy he shed his bundles and lifted her off her feet in a mighty hug i got tickets for barnum bailey s and if you ll bust the string of one of them bundles i guess you ll find that silk waist why good evening mrs fink i didn t see you at first how s old mart coming along he s very well mr cassidy thanks said mrs fink i must be going along up now mart ll be home for supper soon i ll bring you down that pattern you wanted to morrow mame mrs fink went up to her flat and had a little cry it was a meaningless cry the kind of cry that only a woman knows about a cry from no particular cause altogether an absurd cry the most transient and the most hopeless cry in the repertory of grief why had martin never thrashed her he was as big and strong as jack cassidy did he not care for her at all he never quarrelled he came home and lounged about silent glum idle he was a fairly good provider but he ignored the spices of life mrs fink s ship of dreams was becalmed her captain ranged between plum duff and his hammock if only he would shiver his timbers or stamp his foot on the quarter deck now and then and she had thought to sail so merrily touching at ports in the delectable isles but now to vary the figure she was ready to throw up the sponge tired out without a scratch to show for all those tame rounds with her sparring partner for one moment she almost hated mame mame with her cuts and bruises her salve of presents and kisses her stormy voyage with her fighting brutal loving mate mr fink came home at he was permeated with the curse of domesticity beyond the portals of his cozy home he cared not to roam to roam he was the man who had caught the street car the anaconda that had swallowed its prey the tree that lay as it had fallen like the supper mart asked mrs fink who had striven over it m m m yep grunted mr fink after supper he gathered his newspapers to read he sat in his stocking feet arise some new dante and sing me the befitting corner of perdition for the man who sitteth in the house in his stockinged feet sisters of patience who by reason of ties or duty have endured it in silk yarn cotton lisle thread or woollen does not the new canto belong the next day was labor day the occupations of mr cassidy and mr fink ceased for one passage of the sun labor triumphant would parade and otherwise disport itself mrs fink took mrs cassidy s pattern down early maine had on her new silk waist even her damaged eye managed to emit a holiday gleam jack was fruitfully penitent and there was a hilarious scheme for the day afoot with parks and picnics and pilsener in it a rising indignant jealousy seized mrs fink as she returned to her flat above oh happy mame with her bruises and her quick following balm but was mame to have a monopoly of happiness surely martin fink was as good a man as jack cassidy was his wife to go always unbelabored and uncaressed a sudden brilliant breathless idea came to mrs fink she would show mame that there were husbands as able to use their fists and perhaps to be as tender afterward as any jack the holiday promised to be a nominal one with the finks mrs fink had the stationary washtubs in the kitchen filled with a two weeks wash that had been soaking overnight mr fink sat in his stockinged feet reading a newspaper thus labor day presaged to speed jealousy surged high in mrs fink s heart and higher still surged an audacious resolve if her man would not strike her if he would not so far prove his manhood his prerogative and his interest in conjugal affairs he must be prompted to his duty mr fink lit his pipe and peacefully rubbed an ankle with a stockinged toe he reposed in the state of matrimony like a lump of unblended suet in a pudding this was his level elysium to sit at ease vicariously girdling the world in print amid the wifely splashing of suds and the agreeable smells of breakfast dishes departed and dinner ones to come many ideas were far from his mind but the furthest one was the thought of beating his wife mrs fink turned on the hot water and set the washboards in the suds up from the flat below came the gay laugh of mrs cassidy it sounded like a taunt a flaunting of her own happiness in the face of the unslugged bride above now was mrs fink s time suddenly she turned like a fury upon the man reading you lazy loafer she cried must i work my arms off washing and toiling for the ugly likes of you are you a man or are you a kitchen hound mr fink dropped his paper motionless from surprise she feared that he would not strike that the provocation had been insufficient she leaped at him and struck him fiercely in the face with her clenched hand in that instant she felt a thrill of love for hire such as she had not felt for many a day rise up martin fink and come into your kingdom oh she must feel the weight of his hand now just to show that he cared just to show that he cared mr fink sprang to his feet maggie caught him again on the jaw with a wide swing of her other hand she closed her eyes in that fearful blissful moment before his blow should come she whispered his name to herself she leaned to the expected shock hungry for it in the flat below mr cassidy with a shamed and contrite face was powdering mame s eye in preparation for their junket from the flat above came the sound of a woman s voice high raised a bumping a stumbling and a shufing a chair overturned unmistakable sounds of domestic conflict mart and mag scrapping postulated mr cassidy didn t know they ever indulged shall i trot up and see if they need a sponge holder one of mrs cassidy s eyes sparkled like a diamond the other twinkled at least like paste oh oh she said softly and without apparent meaning in the feminine ejaculatory manner i wonder if wonder if wait jack till i go up and see up the stairs she sped as her foot struck the hallway above out from the kitchen door of her flat wildly flounced mrs fink oh maggie cried mrs cassidy in a delighted whisper did he oh did he mrs fink ran and laid her face upon her chum s shoulder and sobbed hopelessly mrs cassidy took maggie s face between her hands and lifted it gently tear stained it was flushing and paling but its velvety pink and white becomingly freckled surface was unscratched unbruised unmarred by the recreant fist of mr fink tell me maggie pleaded mame or i ll go in there and find out what was it did he hurt you what did he do mrs fink s face went down again despairingly on the bosom of her friend for god s sake don t open that door mame she sobbed and don t ever tell nobody keep it under your hat he he never touched me and he s oh gawd he s washin the clothes he s washin the clothes the guilty party a red haired unshaven untidy man sat in a rocking chair by a window he had just lighted a pipe and was puffing blue clouds with great satisfaction he had removed his shoes and donned a pair of blue faded carpet slippers with the morbid thirst of the confirmed daily news drinker he awkwardly folded back the pages of an evening paper eagerly gulping down the strong black headlines to be followed as a chaser by the milder details of the smaller type in an adjoining room a woman was cooking supper odors from strong bacon and boiling coffee contended against the cut plug fumes from the vespertine pipe outside was one of those crowded streets of the east side in which as twilight falls satan sets up his recruiting office a mighty host of children danced and ran and played in the street some in rags some in clean white and beribboned some wild and restless as young hawks some gentle faced and shrinking some shrieking rude and sinful words some listening awed but soon grown familiar to embrace here were the children playing in the corridors of the house of sin above the playground forever hovered a great bird the bird was known to humorists as the stork but the people of chrystie street were better ornithologists they called it a vulture a little girl of twelve came up timidly to the man reading and resting by the window and said papa won t you play a game of checkers with me if you aren t too tired the red haired unshaven untidy man sitting shoeless by the window answered with a frown checkers no i won t can t a man who works hard all day have a little rest when he comes home why don t you go out and play with the other kids on the sidewalk the woman who was cooking came to the door john she said i don t like for lizzie to play in the street they learn too much there that ain t good for em she s been in the house all day long it seems that you might give up a little of your time to amuse her when you come home let her go out and play like the rest of em if she wants to be amused said the red haired unshaven untidy man and don t bother me you re on said kid mullaly fifty dollars to i take annie to the dance put up the kid s black eyes were snapping with the fire of the baited and challenged he drew out his roll and slapped five tens upon the bar the three or four young fellows who were thus taken more slowly produced their stake the bartender ex officio stakeholder took the money laboriously wrapped it recorded the bet with an inch long pencil and stuffed the whole into a corner of the cash register and oh what ll be done to you ll be a plenty said a bettor with anticipatory glee that s my lookout said the kid sternly fill em up all around mike after the round burke the kid s sponge sponge holder pal mentor and grand vizier drew him out to the bootblack stand at the saloon corner where all the official and important matters of the small hours social club were settled as tony polished the light tan shoes of the club s president and secretary for the fifth time that day burke spake words of wisdom to his chief cut that blond out kid was his advice or there ll be trouble what do you want to throw down that girl of yours for you ll never find one that ll freeze to you like liz has she s worth a

my gladsome rags all right through the land of the stork vulture wandered liz her black eyes searched the passing crowds fierily but vaguely now and then she hummed bars of foolish little songs between times she set her small white teeth together and spake crisp words that the east side has added to language liz s skirt was green silk her waist was a large brown and pink plaid well fitting and not without style she wore a cluster ring of huge imitation rubies and a locket that banged her knees at the bottom of a silver chain her shoes were run down over twisted high heels and were strangers to polish her hat would scarcely have passed into a flour barrel the family entrance of the blue jay cafe received her at a table she sat and punched the button with the air of milady ringing for her carriage the waiter came with his large chinned low voiced manner of respectful familiarity liz smoothed her silken skirt with a satisfied wriggle she made the most of it here she could order and be waited upon it was all that her world offered her of the prerogative of woman whiskey tommy she said as her sisters further uptown murmur champagne james sure miss lizzie what ll

on the doorstep of a brick tenement a curly haired child sat puzzling over the convolutions of a tangled string liz flopped down beside her with a crooked shifting smile on her flushed face but her eyes had grown clear and artless of a sudden let me show you how to make a cat s cradle kid she said tucking her green silk skirt under her rusty shoes and while they sat there the lights were being turned on for the dance in the hall of the small hours social club it was the bi monthly dance a dress affair in which the members took great pride and bestirred themselves huskily to further and adorn at o clock the president kid mullaly paced upon the floor with a lady on his arm as the loreley s was her hair golden her yes was softened to a yah but its quality of assent was patent to the most milesian ears she stepped upon her own train and blushed and she smiled into the eyes of kid mullaly and then as the two stood in the middle of the waxed floor the thing happened to prevent which many lamps are burning nightly in many studies and libraries out from the circle of spectators in the hall leaped fate in a green silk skirt under the nom de guerre of liz her eyes were hard and blacker than jet she did not scream or waver most unwomanly she cried out one oath the kid s own favorite oath and in his own deep voice and then while the small hours social club went frantically to pieces she made good her boast to tommy the waiter made good as far as the length of her knife blade and the strength of her arm permitted and next came the primal instinct of self preservation or was it self annihilation the instinct that society has grafted on the natural branch liz ran out and down the street swift and true as a woodcock flying through a grove of saplings at dusk and then followed the big city s biggest shame its most ancient and rotten surviving canker its pollution and disgrace its blight and perversion its forever infamy and guilt fostered unreproved and cherished handed down from a long ago century of the basest barbarity the hue and cry nowhere but in the big cities does it survive and here most of all where the ultimate perfection of culture citizenship and alleged superiority joins bawling in the chase they pursued a shrieking mob of fathers mothers lovers and maidens howling yelling calling whistling crying for blood well may the wolf in the big city stand outside the door well may his heart the gentler falter at the siege knowing her way and hungry for her surcease she darted down the familiar ways until at last her feet struck the dull solidity of the rotting pier and then it was but a few more panting steps and good mother east river took liz to her bosom soothed her muddily taut quickly and settled in five minutes the problem that keeps lights burning o nights in thousands of pastorates and colleges it s mighty funny what kind of dreams one has sometimes poets call them visions but a vision is only a dream in blank verse i dreamed the rest of this story i thought i was in the next world i don t know how i got there i suppose i had been riding on the ninth avenue elevated or taking patent medicine or trying to pull jim jeffries s nose or doing some such little injudicious stunt but anyhow there i was and there was a great crowd of us outside the courtroom where the judgments were going on and every now and then a very beautiful and imposing court officer angel would come outside the door and call another case while i was considering my own worldly sins and wondering whether there would be any use of my trying to prove an alibi by claiming that i lived in new jersey the bailiff angel came to the door and sang out case no up stepped a plain clothes man there were lots of em there dressed exactly like preachers and hustling us spirits around just like cops do on earth and by the arm he dragged whom do you think why liz the court officer took her inside and closed the door i went up to mr fly cop and inquired about the case a very sad one says he laying the points of his manicured fingers together an utterly incorrigible girl i am special terrestrial officer the reverend jones the case was assigned to me the girl murdered her fiance and committed suicide she had no defense my report to the court relates the facts in detail all of which are substantiated by reliable witnesses the wages of sin is death praise the lord the court officer opened the door and stepped out poor girl said special terrestrial officer the reverend jones with a tear in his eye it was one of the saddest cases that i ever met with of course she was discharged said the court officer come here jonesy first thing you know you ll be switched to the pot pie squad how would you like to be on the missionary force in the south sea islands hey now you quit making these false arrests or you ll be transferred see the guilty party you ve not to look for in this case is a red haired unshaven untidy man sitting by the window reading in his stocking feet while his children play in the streets get a move on you now wasn t that a silly dream according to their lights somewhere in the depths of the big city where the unquiet dregs are forever being shaken together young murray and the captain had met and become friends both were at the lowest ebb possible to their fortunes both had fallen from at least an intermediate heaven of respectability and importance and both were typical products of the monstrous and peculiar social curriculum of their overweening and bumptious civic alma mater the captain was no longer a captain one of those sudden moral cataclysms that sometimes sweep the city had hurled him from a high and profitable position in the police department ripping off his badge and buttons and washing into the hands of his lawyers the solid pieces of real estate that his frugality had enabled him to accumulate the passing of the flood left him low and dry one month after his dishabilitation a saloon keeper plucked him by the neck from his free lunch counter as a tabby plucks a strange kitten from her nest and cast him asphaltward this seems low enough but after that he acquired a pair of cloth top button congress gaiters and wrote complaining letters to the newspapers and then he fought the attendant at the municipal lodging house who tried to give him a bath when murray first saw him he was holding the hand of an italian woman who sold apples and garlic on essex street and quoting the words of a song book ballad murray s fall had been more luciferian if less spectacular all the pretty tiny little kickshaws of gotham had once been his the megaphone man roars out at you to observe the house of his uncle on a grand and revered avenue but there had been an awful row about something and the prince had been escorted to the door by the butler which in said avenue is equivalent to the impact of the avuncular shoe a weak prince hal without inheritance or sword he drifted downward to meet his humorless falstaff and to pick the crusts of the streets with him one evening they sat on a bench in a little downtown park the great bulk of the captain which starvation seemed to increase drawing irony instead of pity to his petitions for aid was heaped against the arm of the bench in a shapeless mass his red face spotted by tufts of vermilion week old whiskers and topped by a sagging white straw hat looked in the gloom like one of those structures that you may observe in a dark third avenue window challenging your imagination to say whether it be something recent in the way of ladies hats or a strawberry shortcake a tight drawn belt last relic of his official spruceness made a deep furrow in his circumference the captain s shoes were buttonless in a smothered bass he cursed his star of ill luck murray at his side was shrunk into his dingy and ragged suit of blue serge his hat was pulled low he sat quiet and a little indistinct like some ghost that had been dispossessed i m hungry growled the captain by the top sirloin of the bull of bashan i m starving to death right now i could eat a bowery restaurant clear through to the stovepipe in the alley can t you think of nothing murray you sit there with your shoulders scrunched up giving an irritation of reginald vanderbilt driving his coach what good are them airs doing you now think of some place we can get something to chew you forget my dear captain said murray without moving that our last attempt at dining was at my suggestion you bet it was groaned the captain you bet your life it was have you got any more like that to make hey i admit we failed sighed murray i was sure malone would be good for one more free lunch after the way he talked baseball with me the last time i spent a nickel in his establishment i had this hand said the captain extending the unfortunate member i had this hand on the drum stick of a turkey and two sardine sandwiches when them waiters grabbed us i was within two inches of the olives said murray stuffed olives i haven t tasted one in a year what ll we do grumbled the captain we can t starve can t we said murray quietly i m glad to hear that i was afraid we could you wait here said the captain rising heavily and puffily to his feet i m going to try to make one more turn you stay here till i come back murray i won t be over half an hour if i turn the trick i ll come back flush he made some elephantine attempts at smartening his appearance he gave his fiery mustache a heavenward twist he dragged into sight a pair of black edged cuffs deepened the crease in his middle by tightening his belt another hole and set off jaunty as a zoo rhinoceros across the south end of the park when he was out of sight murray also left the park hurrying swiftly eastward he stopped at a building whose steps were flanked by two green lights a police captain named maroney he said to the desk sergeant was dismissed from the force after being tried under charges three years ago i believe sentence was suspended is this man wanted now by the police why are ye asking inquired the sergeant with a frown i thought there might be a reward standing explained murray easily i know the man well he seems to be keeping himself pretty shady at present i could lay my hands on him at any time if there should be a reward there s no reward interrupted the sergeant shortly the man s not wanted and neither are ye so get out ye are frindly with um and ye would be selling um out with ye quick or i ll give ye a start murray gazed at the officer with serene and virtuous dignity i would be simply doing my duty as a citizen and gentleman he said severely if i could assist the law in laying hold of one of its ofenders murray hurried back to the bench in the park he folded his arms and shrank within his clothes to his ghost like presentment ten minutes afterward the captain arrived at the rendezvous windy and thunderous as a clog day in kansas his collar had been torn away his straw hat had been twisted and battered his shirt with ox blood stripes split to the waist and from head to knee he was drenched with some vile and ignoble greasy fluid that loudly proclaimed to the nose its component leaven of garlic and kitchen stuff for heaven s sake captain sniffed murray i doubt that i would have waited for you if i had suspected you were so desperate as to resort to swill barrels i cheese it said the captain harshly i m not hogging it yet it s all on the outside i went around on essex and proposed marriage to that catrina that s got the fruit shop there now that business could be built up she s a peach as far as a dago could be i thought i had that senoreena mashed sure last week but look what she done to me i guess i got too fresh well there s another scheme queered you don t mean to say said murray with infinite contempt that you would have married that woman to help yourself out of your disgraceful troubles me said the captain i d marry the empress of china for one bowl of chop suey i d commit murder for a plate of beef stew i d steal a wafer from a waif i d be a mormon for a bowl of chowder i think said murray resting his head on his hands that i would play judas for the price of one drink of whiskey for thirty pieces of silver i would oh come now exclaimed the captain in dismay you wouldn t do that murray i always thought that kike s squeal on his boss was about the lowest down play that ever happened a man that gives his friend away is worse than a pirate through the park stepped a large man scanning the benches where the electric light fell is that you mac he said halting before the derelicts his diamond stickpin dazzled his diamond studded fob chain assisted he was big and smooth and well fed yes i see it s you he continued they told me at mike s that i might find you over here let me see you a few minutes mac the captain lifted himself with a grunt of alacrity if charlie finnegan had come down in the bottomless pit to seek him there must be something doing charlie guided him by an arm into a patch of shadow you know mac he said they re trying inspector pickering on graft charges he was my inspector said the captain o shea wants the job went on finnegan he must have it it s for the good of the organization pickering must go under your testimony will do it he was your man higher up when you were on the force his share of the boodle passed through your hands you must go on the stand and testify against him he was began the captain wait a minute said finnegan a bundle of yellowish stuff came out of his inside pocket five hundred dollars in it for you two fifty on the spot and the rest he was my friend i say finished the captain i ll see you and the gang and the city and the party in the flames of hades before i ll take the stand against dan pickering i m down and out but i m no traitor to a man that s been my friend the captain s voice rose and boomed like a split trombone get out of this park charlie finnegan where us thieves and tramps and boozers are your betters and take your dirty money with you finnegan drifted out by another walk the captain turned to his seat i couldn t avoid hearing said murray drearily i think you are the biggest fool i ever saw what would you have done asked the captain nailed pickering to the cross said murray sonny said the captain huskily and without heat you and me are different new york is divided into two parts above forty second street and below fourteenth you come from the other part we both act according to our lights an illuminated clock above the trees retailed the information that it lacked the half hour of twelve both men rose from the bench and moved away together as if seized by the same idea they left the park struck through a narrow cross street and came into broadway at this hour as dark echoing and de peopled as a byway in pompeii northward they turned and a policeman who glanced at their unkempt and slinking figures withheld the attention and suspicion that he would have granted them at any other hour and place for on every street in that part of the city other unkempt and slinking figures were shuffling and hurrying toward a converging point a point that is marked by no monument save that groove on the pavement worn by tens of thousands of waiting feet at ninth street a tall man wearing an opera hat alighted from a broadway car and turned his face westward but he saw murray pounced upon him and dragged him under a street light the captain lumbered slowly to the corner like a wounded bear and waited growling jerry cried the hatted one how fortunate i was to begin a search for you to morrow the old gentleman has capitulated you re to be restored to favor congratulate you come to the office in the morning and get all the money you want i ve liberal instructions in that respect and the little matrimonial arrangement said murray with his head turned sidewise why er well of course your uncle under stands expects that the engagement between you and miss vanderhurst shall be good night said murray moving away you madman cried the other catching his arm would you give up two millions on account of did you ever see her nose old man asked murray solemnly but listen to reason jerry miss vanderhurst is an heiress and did you ever see it yes i admit that her nose isn t good night said murray my friend is waiting for me i am quoting him when i authorize you to report that there is nothing doing good night a wriggling line of waiting men extended from a door in tenth street far up broadway on the outer edge of the pavement the captain and murray fell in at the tail of the quivering millipede twenty feet longer than it was last night said murray looking up at his measuring angle of grace church half an hour growled the captain before we get our punk the city clocks began to strike the bread line moved forward slowly its leathern feet sliding on the stones with the sound of a hissing serpent as they who had lived according to their lights closed up in the rear a midsummer knight s dream the knights are dead their swords are rust except a few who haze to hust le all the time to raise the dust dear reader it was summertime the sun glared down upon the city with pitiless ferocity it is difficult for the sun to be ferocious and exhibit compunction simultaneously the heat was oh bother thermometers who cares for standard measures anyhow it was so hot that the roof gardens put on so many extra waiters that you could hope to get your gin fizz now as soon as all the other people got theirs the hospitals were putting in extra cots for bystanders for when little woolly dogs loll their tongues out and say woof woof at the fleas that bite em and nervous old black bombazine ladies screech mad dog and policemen begin to shoot somebody is going to get hurt the man from pompton n j who always wears an overcoat in july had turned up in a broadway hotel drinking hot scotches and enjoying his annual ray from the calcium philanthropists were petitioning the legislature to pass a bill requiring builders to make tenement fire escapes more commodious so that families might die all together of the heat instead of one or two at a time so many men were telling you about the number of baths they took each day that you wondered how they got along after the real lessee of the apartment came back to town and thanked em for taking such good care of it the young man who called loudly for cold beef and beer in the restaurant protesting that roast pullet and burgundy was really too heavy for such weather blushed when he met your eye for you had heard him all winter calling in modest tones for the same ascetic viands soup pocketbooks shirt waists actors and baseball excuses grew thinner yes it was summertime a man stood at thirty fourth street waiting for a downtown car a man of forty gray haired pink faced keen nervous plainly dressed with a harassed look around the eyes he wiped his forehead and laughed loudly when a fat man with an outing look stopped and spoke with him no siree he shouted with defiance and scorn none of your old mosquito haunted swamps and skyscraper mountains without elevators for me when i want to get away from hot weather i know how to do it new york sir is the finest summer resort in the country keep in the shade and watch your diet and don t get too far away from an electric fan talk about your adirondacks and your catskills there s more solid comfort in the borough of manhattan than in all the rest of the country together no siree no tramping up perpendicular cliffs and being waked up at in the morning by a million flies and eating canned goods straight from the city for me little old new york will take a few select summer boarders comforts and conveniences of homes that s the ad that i answer every time you need a vacation said the fat man looking closely at the other you haven t been away from town in years better come with me for two weeks anyhow the trout in the beaverkill are jumping at anything now that looks like a fly harding writes me that he landed a three pound brown last week nonsense cried the other man go ahead if you like and boggle around in rubber boots wearing yourself out trying to catch fish when i want one i go to a cool restaurant and order it i laugh at you fellows whenever i think of you hustling around in the heat in the country thinking you are having a good time for me father knickerbocker s little improved farm with the big shady lane running through the middle of it the fat man sighed over his friend and went his way the man who thought new york was the greatest summer resort in the country boarded a car and went buzzing down to his office on the way he threw away his newspaper and looked up at a ragged patch of sky above the housetops three pounds he muttered absently and harding isn t a liar i believe if i could but it s impossible they ve got to have another month another month at least in his office the upholder of urban midsummer joys dived headforemost into the swimming pool of business adkins his clerk came and added a spray of letters memoranda and telegrams at o clock in the afternoon the busy man leaned back in his office chair put his feet on the desk and mused aloud i wonder what kind of bait harding used she was all in white that day and thereby compton lost a bet to gaines compton had wagered she would wear light blue for she knew that was his favorite color and compton was a millionaire s son and that almost laid him open to the charge of betting on a sure thing but white was her choice and gaines held up his head with twenty five s lordly air the little summer hotel in the mountains had a lively crowd that year there were two or three young college men and a couple of artists and a young naval officer on one side on the other there were enough beauties among the young ladies for the correspondent of a society paper to refer to them as a bevy but the moon among the stars was mary sewell each one of the young men greatly desired to arrange matters so that he could pay her millinery bills and fix the furnace and have her do away with the sewell part of her name forever those who could stay only a week or two went away hinting at pistols and blighted hearts but compton stayed like the mountains themselves for he could afford it and gaines stayed because he was a fighter and wasn t afraid of millionaire s sons and well he adored the country what do you think miss mary he said once i knew a duffer in new york who claimed to like it in the summer time said you could keep cooler there than you could in the woods wasn t he an awful silly i don t think i could breathe on broadway after the st of june mamma was thinking of going back week after next said miss mary with a lovely frown but when you think of it said gaines there are lots of jolly places in town in the summer the roof gardens you know and the er the roof gardens deepest blue was the lake that day the day when they had the mock tournament and the men rode clumsy farm horses around in a glade in the woods and caught curtain rings on the end of a lance such fun cool and dry as the finest wine came the breath of the shadowed forest the valley below was a vision seen through an opal haze a white mist from hidden falls blurred the green of a hand s breadth of tree tops half way down the gorge youth made merry hand in hand with young summer nothing on broadway like that the villagers gathered to see the city folks pursue their mad drollery the woods rang with the laughter of pixies and naiads and sprites gaines caught most of the rings his was the privilege to crown the queen of the tournament he was the conquering knight as far as the rings went on his arm he wore a white scarf compton wore light blue she had declared her preference for blue but she wore white that day gaines looked about for the queen to crown her he heard her merry laugh as if from the clouds she had slipped away and climbed chimney rock a little granite bluff and stood there a white fairy among the laurels fifty feet above their heads instantly he and compton accepted the implied challenge the bluff was easily mounted at the rear but the front offered small hold to hand or foot each man quickly selected his route and began to climb a crevice a bush a slight projection a vine or tree branch all of these were aids that counted in the race it was all foolery there was no stake but there was youth in it cross reader and light hearts and something else that miss clay writes so charmingly about gaines gave a great tug at the root of a laurel and pulled himself to miss mary s feet on his arm he carried the wreath of roses and while the villagers and summer boarders screamed and applauded below he placed it on the queen s brow you are a gallant knight said miss mary if i could be your true knight always began gaines but miss mary laughed him dumb for compton scrambled over the edge of the rock one minute behind time what a twilight that was when they drove back to the hotel the opal of the valley turned slowly to purple the dark woods framed the lake as a mirror the tonic air stirred the very soul in one the first pale stars came out over the mountain tops where yet a faint glow of i beg your pardon mr gaines said adkins the man who believed new york to be the finest summer resort in the world opened his eyes and kicked over the mucilage bottle on his desk i i believe i was asleep he said it s the heat said adkins it s something awful in the city these nonsense said the other the city beats the country ten to one in summer fools go out tramping in muddy brooks and wear themselves out trying to catch little fish as long as your finger stay in town and keep comfortable that s my idea some letters just came said adkins i thought you might like to glance at them before you go let us look over his shoulder and read just a few lines of one of them my dear dear husband just received your letter ordering us to stay another month rita s cough is almost gone johnny has simply gone wild like a little indian will be the making of both children work so hard and i know that your business can hardly afford to keep us here so long best man that ever you always pretend that you like the city in summer trout fishing that you used to be so fond of and all to keep us well and happy come to you if it were not doing the babies so much good i stood last evening on chimney rock in exactly the same spot where i was when you put the wreath of roses on my head through all the world when you said you would be my true knight fifteen years ago dear just think have always been that to me ever and ever mary the man who said he thought new york the finest summer resort in the country dropped into a cafe on his way home and had a glass of beer under an electric fan wonder what kind of a fly old harding used he said to himself the last leaf in a little district west of washington square the streets have run crazy and broken themselves into small strips called places these places make strange angles and curves one street crosses itself a time or two an artist once discovered a valuable possibility in this street suppose a collector with a bill for paints paper and canvas should in traversing this route suddenly meet himself coming back without a cent having been paid on account so to quaint old greenwich village the art people soon came prowling hunting for north windows and eighteenth century gables and dutch attics and low rents then they imported some pewter mugs and a chafing dish or two from sixth avenue and became a colony at the top of a squatty three story brick sue and johnsy had their studio johnsy was familiar for joanna one was from maine the other from california they had met at the table d hote of an eighth street delmonico s and found their tastes in art chicory salad and bishop sleeves so congenial that the joint studio resulted that was in may in november a cold unseen stranger whom the doctors called pneumonia stalked about the colony touching one here and there with his icy fingers over on the east side this ravager strode boldly smiting his victims by scores but his feet trod slowly through the maze of the narrow and moss grown places mr pneumonia was not what you would call a chivalric old gentleman a mite of a little woman with blood thinned by california zephyrs was hardly fair game for the red fisted short breathed old duffer but johnsy he smote and she lay scarcely moving on her painted iron bedstead looking through the small dutch window panes at the blank side of the next brick house one morning the busy doctor invited sue into the hallway with a shaggy gray eyebrow she has one chance in let us say ten he said as he shook down the mercury in his clinical thermometer and that chance is for her to want to live this way people have of lining up on the side of the undertaker makes the entire pharmacopeia look silly your little lady has made up her mind that she s not going to get well has she anything on her mind she she wanted to paint the bay of naples some day said sue paint bosh has she anything on her mind worth thinking about twice a man for instance a man said sue with a jew s harp twang in her voice is a man worth but no doctor there is nothing of the kind well it is the weakness then said the doctor i will do all that science so far as it may filter through my efforts can accomplish but whenever my patient begins to count the carriages in her funeral procession i subtract per cent from the curative power of medicines if you will get her to ask one question about the new winter styles in cloak sleeves i will promise you a one in five chance for her instead of one in ten after the doctor had gone sue went into the workroom and cried a japanese napkin to a pulp then she swaggered into johnsy s room with her drawing board whistling ragtime johnsy lay scarcely making a ripple under the bedclothes with her face toward the window sue stopped whistling thinking she was asleep she arranged her board and began a pen and ink drawing to illustrate a magazine story young artists must pave their way to art by drawing pictures for magazine stories that young authors write to pave their way to literature as sue was sketching a pair of elegant horseshow riding trousers and a monocle on the figure of the hero an idaho cowboy she heard a low sound several times repeated she went quickly to the bedside johnsy s eyes were open wide she was looking out the window and counting counting backward twelve she said and a little later eleven and then ten and nine and then eight and seven almost together sue looked solicitously out the window what was there to count there was only a bare dreary yard to be seen and the blank side of the brick house twenty feet away an old old ivy vine gnarled and decayed at the roots climbed half way up the brick wall the cold breath of autumn had stricken its leaves from the vine until its skeleton branches clung almost bare to the crumbling bricks what is it dear asked sue six said johnsy in almost a whisper they re falling faster now three days ago there were almost a hundred it made my head ache to count them but now it s easy there goes another one there are only five left now five what dear tell your sudie leaves on the ivy vine when the last one falls i must go too i ve known that for three days didn t the doctor tell you oh i never heard of such nonsense complained sue with magnificent scorn what have old ivy leaves to do with your getting well and you used to love that vine so you naughty girl don t be a goosey why the doctor told me this morning that your chances for getting well real soon were let s see exactly what he said he said the chances were ten to one why that s almost as good a chance as we have in new york when we ride on the street cars or walk past a new building try to take some broth now and let sudie go back to her drawing so she can sell the editor man with it and buy port wine for her sick child and pork chops for her greedy self you needn t get any more wine said johnsy keeping her eyes fixed out the window there goes another no i don t want any broth that leaves just four i want to see the last one fall before it gets dark then i ll go too johnsy dear said sue bending over her will you promise me to keep your eyes closed and not look out the window until i am done working i must hand those drawings in by to morrow i need the light or i would draw the shade down couldn t you draw in the other room asked johnsy coldly i d rather be here by you said sue besides i don t want you to keep looking at those silly ivy leaves tell me as soon as you have finished said johnsy closing her eyes and lying white and still as a fallen statue because i want to see the last one fall i m tired of waiting i m tired of thinking i went to turn loose my hold on everything and go sailing down down just like one of those poor tired leaves try to sleep said sue i must call behrman up to be my model for the old hermit miner i ll not be gone a minute don t try to move till i come back old behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor beneath them he was past sixty and had a michael angelo s moses beard curling down from the head of a satyr along the body of an imp behrman was a failure in art forty years he had wielded the brush without getting near enough to touch the hem of his mistress s robe he had been always about to paint a masterpiece but had never yet begun it for several years he had painted nothing except now and then a daub in the line of commerce or advertising he earned a little by serving as a model to those young artists in the colony who could not pay the price of a professional he drank gin to excess and still talked of his coming masterpiece for the rest he was a fierce little old man who scoffed terribly at softness in any one and who regarded himself as especial mastiff in waiting to protect the two young artists in the studio above sue found behrman smelling strongly of juniper berries in his dimly lighted den below in one corner was a blank canvas on an easel that had been waiting there for twenty five years to receive the first line of the masterpiece she told him of johnsy s fancy and how she feared she would indeed light and fragile as a leaf herself float away when her slight hold upon the world grew weaker old behrman with his red eyes plainly streaming shouted his contempt and derision for such idiotic imaginings vass he cried is dere people in de world mit der foolishness to die because leafs dey drop off from a confounded vine i haf not heard of such a thing no i will not bose as a model for your fool hermit dunderhead vy do you allow dot silly pusiness to come in der prain of her ach dot poor lettle miss johnsy she is very ill and weak said sue and the fever has left her mind morbid and full of strange fancies very well mr behrman if you do not care to pose for me you needn t but i think you are a horrid old old flibbertigibbet you are just like a woman yelled behrman who said i will not bose go on i come mit you for half an hour i haf peen trying to say dot i am ready to bose gott dis is not any blace in which one so goot as miss yohnsy shall lie sick some day i vill baint a masterpiece and ve shall all go away gott yes johnsy was sleeping when they went upstairs sue pulled the shade down to the window sill and motioned behrman into the other room in there they peered out the window fearfully at the ivy vine then they looked at each other for a moment without speaking a persistent cold rain was falling mingled with snow behrman in his old blue shirt took his seat as the hermit miner on an upturned kettle for a rock when sue awoke from an hour s sleep the next morning she found johnsy with dull wide open eyes staring at the drawn green shade pull it up i want to see she ordered in a whisper wearily sue obeyed but lo after the beating rain and fierce gusts of wind that had endured through the livelong night there yet stood out against the brick wall one ivy leaf it was the last on the vine still dark green near its stem but with its serrated edges tinted with the yellow of dissolution and decay it hung bravely from a branch some twenty feet above the ground it is the last one said johnsy i thought it would surely fall during the night i heard the wind it will fall to day and i shall die at the same time dear dear said sue leaning her worn face down to the pillow think of me if you won t think of yourself what would i do but johnsy did not answer the lonesomest thing in all the world is a soul when it is making ready to go on its mysterious far journey the fancy seemed to possess her more strongly as one by one the ties that bound her to friendship and to earth were loosed the day wore away and even through the twilight they could see the lone ivy leaf clinging to its stem against the wall and then with the coming of the night the north wind was again loosed while the rain still beat against the windows and pattered down from the low dutch eaves when it was light enough johnsy the merciless commanded that the shade be raised the ivy leaf was still there johnsy lay for a long time looking at it and then she called to sue who was stirring her chicken broth over the gas stove i ve been a bad girl sudie said johnsy something has made that last leaf stay there to show me how wicked i was it is a sin to want to die you may bring me a little broth now and some milk with a little port in it and no bring me a hand mirror first and then pack some pillows about me and i will sit up and watch you cook an hour later she said sudie some day i hope to paint the bay of naples the doctor came in the afternoon and sue had an excuse to go into the hallway as he left even chances said the doctor taking sue s thin shaking hand in his with good nursing you ll win and now i must see another case i have downstairs behrman his name is some kind of an artist i believe pneumonia too he is an old weak man and the attack is acute there is no hope for him but he goes to the hospital to day to be made more comfortable the next day the doctor said to sue she s out of danger you ve won nutrition and care now that s all and that afternoon sue came to the bed where johnsy lay contentedly knitting a very blue and very useless woolen shoulder scarf and put one arm around her pillows and all i have something to tell you white mouse she said mr behrman died of pneumonia to day in the hospital he was ill only two days the janitor found him on the morning of the first day in his room downstairs helpless with pain his shoes and clothing were wet through and icy cold they couldn t imagine where he had been on such a dreadful night and then they found a lantern still lighted and a ladder that had been dragged from its place and some scattered brushes and a palette with green and yellow colors mixed on it and look out the window dear at the last ivy leaf on the wall didn t you wonder why it never fluttered or moved when the wind blew ah darling it s behrman s masterpiece he painted it there the night that the last leaf fell the count and the wedding guest one evening when andy donovan went to dinner at his second avenue boarding house mrs scott introduced him to a new boarder a young lady miss conway miss conway was small and unobtrusive she wore a plain snuffy brown dress and bestowed her interest which seemed languid upon her plate she lifted her diffident eyelids and shot one perspicuous judicial glance at mr donovan politely murmured his name and returned to her mutton mr donovan bowed with the grace and beaming smile that were rapidly winning for him social business and political advancement and erased the snuffy brown one from the tablets of his consideration two weeks later andy was sitting on the front steps enjoying his cigar there was a soft rustle behind and above him and andy turned his head and had his head turned just coming out the door was miss conway she wore a night black dress of crepe de crepe de oh this thin black goods her hat was black and from it drooped and fluttered an ebon veil filmy as a spider s web she stood on the top step and drew on black silk gloves not a speck of white or a spot of color about her dress anywhere her rich golden hair was drawn with scarcely a ripple into a shining smooth knot low on her neck her face was plain rather than pretty but it was now illuminated and made almost beautiful by her large gray eyes that gazed above the houses across the street into the sky with an expression of the most appealing sadness and melancholy gather the idea girls all black you know with the preference for crepe de oh crepe de chine that s it all black and that sad faraway look and the hair shining under the black veil you have to be a blonde of course and try to look as if although your young life had been blighted just as it was about to give a hop skip and a jump over the threshold of life a walk in the park might do you good and be sure to happen out the door at the right moment and oh it ll fetch em every time but it s fierce now how cynical i am ain t it to talk about mourning costumes this way mr donovan suddenly reinscribed miss conway upon the tablets of his consideration he threw away the remaining inch and a quarter of his cigar that would have been good for eight minutes yet and quickly shifted his center of gravity to his low cut patent leathers it s a fine clear evening miss conway he said and if the weather bureau could have heard the confident emphasis of his tones it would have hoisted the square white signal and nailed it to the mast to them that has the heart to enjoy it it is mr donovan said miss conway with a sigh mr donovan in his heart cursed fair weather heartless weather it should hail and blow and snow to be consonant with the mood of miss conway i hope none of your relatives i hope you haven t sustained a loss ventured mr donovan death has claimed said miss conway hesitating not a relative but one who but i will not intrude my brief upon you mr donovan intrude protested mr donovan why say miss conway i d be delighted that is i d be sorry i mean i m sure nobody could sympathize with you truer than i would miss conway smiled a little smile and oh it was sadder than her expression in repose laugh and the world laughs with you weep and they give you the laugh she quoted i have learned that mr donovan i have no friends or acquaintances in this city but you have been kind to me i appreciate it highly he had passed her the pepper twice at the table it s tough to be alone in new york that s a cinch said mr donovan but say whenever this little old town does loosen up and get friendly it goes the limit say you took a little stroll in the park miss conway don t you think it might chase away some of your mullygrubs and if you d allow me thanks mr donovan i d be pleased to accept of your escort if you think the company of one whose heart is filled with gloom could be anyways agreeable to you through the open gates of the iron railed old downtown park where the elect once took the air they strolled and found a quiet bench there is this difference between the grief of youth and that of old age youth s burden is lightened by as much of it as another shares old age may give and give but the sorrow remains the same he was my fiance confided miss conway at the end of an hour we were going to be married next spring i don t want you to think that i am stringing you mr donovan but he was a real count he had an estate and a castle in italy count fernando mazzini was his name i never saw the beat of him for elegance papa objected of course and once we eloped but papa overtook us and took us back i thought sure papa and fernando would fight a duel papa has a livery business in p kipsee you know finally papa came round all right and said we might be married next spring fernando showed him proofs of his title and wealth and then went over to italy to get the castle fixed up for us papa s very proud and when fernando wanted to give me several thousand dollars for my trousseau he called him down something awful he wouldn t even let me take a ring or any presents from him and when fernando sailed i came to the city and got a position as cashier in a candy store three days ago i got a letter from italy forwarded from p kipsee saying that fernando had been killed in a gondola accident that is why i am in mourning my heart mr donovan will remain forever in his grave i guess i am poor company mr donovan but i cannot take any interest in no one i should not care to keep you from gayety and your friends who can smile and entertain you perhaps you would prefer to walk back to the house now girls if you want to observe a young man hustle out after a pick and shovel just tell him that your heart is in some other fellow s grave young men are grave robbers by nature ask any widow something must be done to restore that missing organ to weeping angels in crepe de chine dead men certainly get the worst of it from all sides i m awfully sorry said mr donovan gently no we won t walk back to the house just yet and don t say you haven t no friends in this city miss conway i m awful sorry and i want you to believe i m your friend and that i m awful sorry i ve got his picture here in my locket said miss conway after wiping her eyes with her handkerchief i never showed it to anybody but i will to you mr donovan because i believe you to be a true friend mr donovan gazed long and with much interest at the photograph in the locket that miss conway opened for him the face of count mazzini was one to command interest it was a smooth intelligent bright almost a handsome face the face of a strong cheerful man who might well be a leader among his fellows i have a larger one framed in my room said miss conway when we return i will show you that they are all i have to remind me of fernando but he ever will be present in my heart that s a sure thing a subtle task confronted mr donovan that of supplanting the unfortunate count in the heart of miss conway this his admiration for her determined him to do but the magnitude or the undertaking did not seem to weigh upon his spirits the sympathetic but cheerful friend was the role he essayed and he played it so successfully that the next half hour found them conversing pensively across two plates of ice cream though yet there wars no diminution of the sadness in miss conway s large gray eyes before they parted in the hall that evening she ran upstairs and brought down the framed photograph wrapped lovingly in a white silk scarf mr donovan surveyed it with inscrutable eyes he gave me this the night he left for italy said miss conway i had the one for the locket made from this a fine looking man said mr donovan heartily how would it suit you miss conway to give me the pleasure of your company to coney next sunday afternoon a month later they announced their engagement to mrs scott and the other boarders miss conway continued to wear black a week after the announcement the two sat on the same bench in the downtown park while the fluttering leaves of the trees made a dim kinetoscopic picture of them in the moonlight but donovan had worn a look of abstracted gloom all day he was so silent to night that love s lips could not keep back any longer the questions that love s heart propounded what s the matter andy you are so solemn and grouchy to night nothing maggie i know better can t i tell you never acted this way before what is it it s nothing much maggie yes it is and i want to know i ll bet it s some other girl you are thinking about all right why don t you go get her if you want her take your arm away if you please i ll tell you then said andy wisely but i guess you won t understand it exactly you ve heard of mike sullivan haven t you big mike sullivan everybody calls him no i haven t said maggie and i don t want to if he makes you act like this who is he he s the biggest man in new york said andy almost reverently he can about do anything he wants to with tammany or any other old thing in the political line he s a mile high and as broad as east river you say anything against big mike and you ll have a million men on your collarbone in about two seconds why he made a visit over to the old country awhile back and the kings took to their holes like rabbits well big mike s a friend of mine i ain t more than deuce high in the district as far as influence goes but mike s as good a friend to a little man or a poor man as he is to a big one i met him to day on the bowery and what do you think he does comes up and shakes hands andy says he i ve been keeping cases on you you ve been putting in some good licks over on your side of the street and i m proud of you what ll you take to drink he takes a cigar and i take a highball i told him i was going to get married in two weeks andy says he send me an invitation so i ll keep in mind of it and i ll come to the wedding that s what big mike says to me and he always does what he says you don t understand it maggie but i d have one of my hands cut off to have big mike sullivan at our wedding it would be the proudest day of my life when he goes to a man s wedding there s a guy being married that s made for life now that s why i m maybe looking sore to night why don t you invite him then if he s so much to the mustard said maggie lightly there s a reason why i can t said andy sadly there s a reason why he mustn t be there don t ask me what it is for i can t tell you oh i don t care said maggie it s something about politics of course but it s no reason why you can t smile at me maggie said andy presently do you think as much of me as you did of your as you did of the count mazzini he waited a long time but maggie did not reply and then suddenly she leaned against his shoulder and began to cry to cry and shake with sobs holding his arm tightly and wetting the crepe de chine with tears there there there soothed andy putting aside his own trouble and what is it now andy sobbed maggie i ve lied to you and you ll never marry me or love me any more but i feel that i ve got to tell andy there never was so much as the little finger of a count i never had a beau in my life but all the other girls had and they talked about em and that seemed to make the fellows like em more and andy i look swell in black you know i do so i went out to a photograph store and bought that picture and had a little one made for my locket and made up all that story about the count and about his being killed so i could wear black and nobody can love a liar and you ll shake me andy and i ll die for shame oh there never was anybody i liked but you and that s all but instead of being pushed away she found andy s arm folding her closer she looked up and saw his face cleared and smiling could you could you forgive me andy sure said andy it s all right about that back to the cemetery for the count you ve straightened everything out maggie i was in hopes you would before the wedding day bully girl andy said maggie with a somewhat shy smile after she had been thoroughly assured of forgiveness did you believe all that story about the count well not to any large extent said andy reaching for his cigar case because it s big mike sullivan s picture you ve got in that locket of yours the country of elusion the cunning writer will choose an indefinable subject for he can then set down his theory of what it is and next at length his conception of what it is not and lo his paper is covered therefore let us follow the prolix and unmapable trail into that mooted country bohemia grainger sub editor of doc s magazine closed his roll top desk put on his hat walked into the hall punched the down button and waited for the elevator grainger s day had been trying the chief had tried to ruin the magazine a dozen times by going against grainger s ideas for running it a lady whose grandfather had fought with mcclellan had brought a portfolio of poems in person grainger was curator of the lion s house of the magazine that day he had lunched an arctic explorer a short story writer and the famous conductor of a slaughter house expose consequently his mind was in a whirl of icebergs maupassant and trichinosis but there was a surcease and a recourse there was bohemia he would seek distraction there and let s see he would call by for mary adrian half an hour later he threaded his way like a brazilian orchid hunter through the palm forest in the tiled entrance hall of the idealia apartment house one day the christeners of apartment houses and the cognominators of sleeping cars will meet and there will be some jealous and sanguinary knifing the clerk breathed grainger s name so languidly into the house telephone that it seemed it must surely drop from sheer inertia down to the janitor s regions but at length it soared dilatorily up to miss adrian s ear certainly mr grainger was to come up immediately a colored maid with an eliza crossing the ice expression opened the door of the apartment for him grainger walked sideways down the narrow hall a bunch of burnt umber hair and a sea green eye appeared in the crack of a door a long white undraped arm came out barring the way so glad you came ricky instead of any of the others said the eye light a cigarette and give it to me going to take me to dinner fine go into the front room till i finish dressing but don t sit in your usual chair there s pie in it meringue kappelman threw it at reeves last evening while he was reciting sophy has just come to straighten up is it lit thanks there s scotch on the mantel oh no it isn t that s chartreuse ask sophy to find you some i won t be long grainger escaped the meringue as he waited his spirits sank still lower the atmosphere of the room was as vapid as a zephyr wandering over a vesuvian lava bed relics of some feast lay about the room scattered in places where even a prowling cat would have been surprised to find them a straggling cluster of deep red roses in a marmalade jar bowed their heads over tobacco ashes and unwashed goblets a chafing dish stood on the piano a leaf of sheet music supported a stack of sandwiches in a chair mary came in dressed and radiant her gown was of that thin black fabric whose name through the change of a single vowel seems to summon visions ranging between the extremes of man s experience spelled with an e it belongs to gallic witchery and diaphanous dreams with an e it drapes lamentation and woe that evening they went to the cafe andre and as people would confide to you in a whisper that andre s was the only truly bohemian restaurant in town it may be well to follow them andre began his professional career as a waiter in a bowery ten cent eating house had you seen him there you would have called him tough to yourself not aloud for he would have soaked you as quickly as he would have soaked his thumb in your coffee he saved money and started a basement table d hote in eighth or ninth street one afternoon andre drank too much absinthe he announced to his startled family that he was the grand llama of thibet therefore requiring an empty audience hall in which to be worshiped he moved all the tables and chairs from the restaurant into the back yard wrapped a red table cloth around himself and sat on a step ladder for a throne when the diners began to arrive madame in a flurry of despair laid cloths and ushered them trembling outside between the tables clothes lines were stretched bearing the family wash a party of bohemia hunters greeted the artistic innovation with shrieks and acclamations of delight that week s washing was not taken in for two years when andre came to his senses he had the menu printed on stiffly starched cuffs and served the ices in little wooden tubs next he took down his sign and darkened the front of the house when you went there to dine you fumbled for an electric button and pressed it a lookout slid open a panel in the door looked at you suspiciously and asked if you were acquainted with senator herodotus q mcmilligan of the chickasaw nation if you were you were admitted and allowed to dine if you were not you were admitted and allowed to dine there you have one of the abiding principles of bohemia when andre had accumulated he moved up town near broadway in the fierce light that beats upon the thrown down there we find him and leave him with customers in pearls and automobile veils striving to catch his excellently graduated nod of recognition there is a large round table in the northeast corner of andre s at which six can sit to this table grainger and mary adrian made their way kappelman and reeves were already there and miss tooker who designed the may cover for the ladies notathome magazine and mrs pothunter who never drank anything but black and white highballs being in mourning for her husband who oh i ve forgotten what he did died like as not spaghetti weary reader wouldst take one penny in the slot peep into the fair land of bohemia then look and when you think you have seen it you have not and it is neither thimbleriggery nor astigmatism the walls of the cafe andre were covered with original sketches by the artists who furnished much of the color and sound of the place fair woman furnished the theme for the bulk of the drawings when you say sirens and siphons you come near to estimating the alliterative atmosphere of andre s first i want you to meet my friend miss adrian miss tooker and mrs pothunter you already know while she tucks in the fingers of her elbow gloves you shall have her daguerreotype so faint and uncertain shall the portrait be age somewhere between twenty seven and highneck evening dresses camaraderie in large bunches whatever the fearful word may mean habitat anywhere from seattle to terra del fuego temperament uncharted she let reeves squeeze her hand after he recited one of his poems but she counted the change after sending him out with a dollar to buy some pickled pig s feet deportment out of a possible morals mary was one of the princesses of bohemia in the first place it was a royal and a daring thing to have been named mary there are twenty fifines and heloises to one mary in the country of elusion now her gloves are tucked in miss tooker has assumed a june poster pose mrs pothunter has bitten her lips to make the red show reeves has several times felt his coat to make sure that his latest poem is in the pocket it had been neatly typewritten but he has copied it on the backs of letters with a pencil kappelman is underhandedly watching the clock it is ten minutes to nine when the hour comes it is to remind him of a story synopsis a french girl says to her suitor did you ask my father for my hand at nine o clock this morning as you said you would i did not he replies at nine o clock i was fighting a duel with swords in the bois de boulogne coward she hisses the dinner was ordered you know how the bohemian feast of reason keeps up with the courses humor with the oysters wit with the soup repartee with the entree brag with the roast knocks for whistler and kipling with the salad songs with the coffee the slapsticks with the cordials between miss adrian s eyebrows was the pucker that shows the intense strain it requires to be at ease in bohemia pat must come each sally mot and epigram every second of deliberation upon a reply costs you a bay leaf fine as a hair a line began to curve from her nostrils to her mouth to hold her own not a chance must be missed a sentence addressed to her must be as a piccolo each word of it a stop which she must be prepared to seize upon and play and she must always be quicker than a micmac indian to paddle the light canoe of conversation away from the rocks in the rapids that flow from the pierian spring for plodding reader the handwriting on the wall in the banquet hall of bohemia is laisser faire the gray ghost that sometimes peeps through the rings of smoke is that of slain old king convention freedom is the tyrant that holds them in slavery as the dinner waned hands reached for the pepper eruct rather than for the shaker of attic salt miss tooker with an elbow to business leaned across the table toward grainger upsetting her glass of wine now while you are fed and in good humor she said i want to make a suggestion to you about a new cover a good idea said grainger mopping the tablecloth with his napkin i ll speak to the waiter about it kappelman the painter was the cut up as a piece of delicate athenian wit he got up from his chair and waltzed down the room with a waiter that dependent no doubt an honest pachydermatous worthy tax paying art despising biped released himself from the unequal encounter carried his professional smile back to the dumb waiter and dropped it down the shaft to eternal oblivion reeves began to make keats turn in his grave mrs pothunter told the story of the man who met the widow on the train miss adrian hummed what is still called a chanson in the cafes of bridgeport grainger edited each individual effort with his assistant editor s smile which meant great but you ll have to send them in through the regular channels if i were the chief now but you know how it is and soon the head waiter bowed before them desolated to relate that the closing hour had already become chronologically historical so out all trooped into the starry midnight falling the street with gay laughter to be barked at by hopeful cabmen and enviously eyed by the dull inhabitants of an uninspired world grainger left mary at the elevator in the trackless palm forest of the idealia after he had gone she came down again carrying a small hand bag phoned for a cab drove to the grand central station boarded a commuter s train rode four hours with her burnt umber head bobbing against the red plush back of the seat and landed during a fresh stinging glorious sunrise at a deserted station the size of a peach crate called crocusville she walked a mile and clicked the latch of a gate a bare brown cottage stood twenty yards back an old man with a pearl white calvinistic face and clothes dyed blacker than a raven in a coal mine was washing his hands in a tin basin on the front porch how are you father said mary timidly i am as well as providence permits mary ann you will find your mother in the kitchen in the kitchen a cryptic gray woman kissed her glacially on the forehead and pointed out the potatoes which were not yet peeled for breakfast mary sat in a wooden chair and decorticated spuds with a thrill in her heart for breakfast there were grace cold bread potatoes bacon and tea you are pursuing the same avocation in the city concerning which you have advised us from time to time by letter i trust said her father yes said mary i am still reviewing books for the same publication after breakfast she helped wash the dishes and then all three sat in straigh back chairs in the bare floored parlor it is my custom said the old man on the sabbath day to read aloud from the great work entitled the apology for authorized and set forms of liturgy by the ecclesiastical philosopher and revered theologian jeremy taylor i know it said mary blissfully folding her hands for two hours the numbers of the great jeremy rolled forth like the notes of an oratorio played on the violoncello mary sat gloating in the new sensation of racking physical discomfort that the wooden chair brought her perhaps there is no happiness in life so perfect as the martyr s jeremy s minor chords soothed her like the music of a tom tom why oh why she said to herself does some one not write words to it at eleven they went to church in crocusville the back of the pine bench on which she sat had a penitential forward tilt that would have brought st simeon down in jealousy from his pillar the preacher singled her out and thundered upon her vicarious head the damnation of the world at each side of her an adamant parent held her rigidly to the bar of judgment an ant crawled upon her neck but she dared not move she lowered her eyes before the congregation a hundred eyed cerberus that watched the gates through which her sins were fast thrusting her her soul was filled with a delirious almost a fanatic joy for she was out of the clutch of the tyrant freedom dogma and creed pinioned her with beneficent cruelty as steel braces bind the feet of a crippled child she was hedged adjured shackled shored up strait jacketed silenced ordered when they came out the minister stopped to greet them mary could only hang her head and answer yes sir and no sir to his questions when she saw that the other women carried their hymn books at their waists with their left hands she blushed and moved hers there too from her right she took the three o clock train back to the city at nine she sat at the round table for dinner in the cafe andre nearly the same crowd was there where have you been to day asked mrs pothunter i phoned to you at twelve i have been away in bohemia answered mary with a mystic smile there mary has given it away she has spoiled my climax for i was to have told you that bohemia is nothing more than the little country in which you do not live if you try to obtain citizenship in it at once the court and retinue pack the royal archives and treasure and move away beyond the hills it is a hillside that you turn your head to peer at from the windows of the through express at exactly half past eleven kappelman deceived by a new softness and slowness of riposte and parry in mary adrian tried to kiss her instantly she slapped his face with such strength and cold fury that he shrank down sobered with the flaming red print of a hand across his leering features and all sounds ceased as when the shadows of great wings come upon a flock of chattering sparrows one had broken the paramount law of sham bohemia the law of laisser faire the shock came not from the blow delivered but from the blow received with the effect of a schoolmaster entering the play room of his pupils was that blow administered women pulled down their sleeves and laid prim hands against their ruffled side locks men looked at their watches there was nothing of the effect of a brawl about it it was purely the still panic produced by the sound of the ax of the fly cop conscience hammering at the gambling house doors of the heart with their punctilious putting on of cloaks with their exaggerated pretense of not having seen or heard with their stammering exchange of unaccustomed formalities with their false show of a light hearted exit i must take leave of my bohemian party mary has robbed me of my climax and she may go but i am not defeated somewhere there exists a great vault miles broad and miles long more capacious than the champagne caves of france in that vault are stored the anticlimaxes that should have been tagged to all the stories that have been told in the world i shall cheat that vault of one deposit minnie brown with her aunt came from crocusville down to the city to see the sights and because she had escorted me to fishless trout streams and exhibited to me open plumbed waterfalls and broken my camera while i julyed in her village i must escort her to the hives containing the synthetic clover honey of town especially did the custom made bohemia charm her the spaghetti wound its tendrils about her heart the free red wine drowned her belief in the existence of commercialism in the world she was dared and enchanted by the rugose wit that can be churned out of california claret but one evening i got her away from the smell of halibut and linoleum long enough to read to her the manuscript of this story which then ended before her entrance into it i read it to her because i knew that all the printing presses in the world were running to try to please her and some others and i asked her about it i didn t quite catch the trains said she how long was mary in crocusville ten hours and five minutes i replied well then the story may do said minnie but if she had stayed there a week kappelman would have got his kiss the ferry of unfulfilment at the street corner as solid as granite in the rush hour tide of humanity stood the man from nome the arctic winds and sun had stained him berry brown his eye still held the azure glint of the glaciers he was as alert as a fox as tough as a caribou cutlet and as broad gauged as the aurora borealis he stood sprayed by a niagara of sound the crash of the elevated trains clanging cars pounding of rubberless tires and the antiphony of the cab and truck drivers indulging in scarifying repartee and so with his gold dust cashed in to the merry air of a hundred thousand and with the cakes and ale of one week in gotham turning bitter on his tongue the man from nome sighed to set foot again in chilkoot the exit from the land of street noises and dead sea apple pies up sixth avenue with the tripping scurrying chattering bright eyed homing tide came the girl from sieber mason s the man from nome looked and saw first that she was supremely beautiful after his own conception of beauty and next that she moved with exactly the steady grace of a dog sled on a level crust of snow his third sensation was an instantaneous conviction that he desired her greatly for his own this quickly do men from nome make up their minds besides he was going back to the north in a short time and to act quickly was no less necessary a thousand girls from the great department store of sieber mason flowed along the sidewalk making navigation dangerous to men whose feminine field of vision for three years has been chiefly limited to siwash and chilkat squaws but the man from nome loyal to her who had resurrected his long cached heart plunged into the stream of pulchritude and followed her down twenty third street she glided swiftly looking to neither side no more flirtatious than the bronze diana above the garden her fine brown hair was neatly braided her neat waist and unwrinkled black skirt were eloquent of the double virtues taste and economy ten yards behind followed the smitten man from nome miss claribel colby the girl from sieber mason s belonged to that sad company of mariners known as jersey commuters she walked into the waiting room of the ferry and up the stairs and by a marvellous swift little run caught the ferry boat that was just going out the man from nome closed up his ten yards in three jumps and gained the deck close beside her miss colby chose a rather lonely seat on the outside of the upper cabin the night was not cold and she desired to be away from the curious eyes and tedious voices of the passengers besides she was extremely weary and drooping from lack of sleep on the previous night she had graced the annual ball and oyster fry of the west side wholesale fish dealers assistants social club no thus reducing her usual time of sleep to only three hours and the day had been uncommonly troublous customers had been inordinately trying the buyer in her department had scolded her roundly for letting her stock run down her best friend mamie tuthill had snubbed her by going to lunch with that dockery girl the girl from sieber mason s was in that relaxed softened mood that often comes to the independent feminine wage earner it is a mood most propitious for the man who would woo her then she has yearnings to be set in some home and heart to be comforted and to hide behind some strong arm and rest rest but miss claribel colby was also very sleepy there came to her side a strong man browned and dressed carelessly in the best of clothes with his hat in his hand lady said the man from nome respectfully excuse me for speaking to you but i i i saw you on the street and and oh gee remarked the girl from sieber mason s glancing up with the most capable coolness ain t there any way to ever get rid of you mashers i ve tried everything from eating onions to using hatpins be on your way freddie i m not one of that kind lady said the man from nome honest i m not as i say i saw you on the street and i wanted to know you so bad i couldn t help followin after you i was afraid i wouldn t ever see you again in this big town unless i spoke and that s why i done so miss colby looked once shrewdly at him in the dim light on the ferry boat no he did not have the perfidious smirk or the brazen swagger of the lady killer sincerity and modesty shone through his boreal tan it seemed to her that it might be good to hear a little of what he had to say you may sit down she said laying her hand over a yawn with ostentatious politness and mind don t get fresh or i ll call the steward the man from nome sat by her side he admired her greatly he more than admired her she had exactly the looks he had tried so long in vain to find in a woman could she ever come to like him well that was to be seen he must do all in his power to stake his claim anyhow my name s blayden said he henry blayden are you real sure it ain t jones asked the girl leaning toward him with delicious knowing raillery i m down from nome he went on with anxious seriousness i scraped together a pretty good lot of dust up there and brought it down with me oh say she rippled pursuing persiflage with engaging lightness then you must be on the white wings force i thought i d seen you somewhere you didn t see me on the street to day when i saw you i never look at fellows on the street well i looked at you and i never looked at anything before that i thought was half as pretty shall i keep the change yes i reckon so i reckon you could keep anything i ve got i reckon i m what you would call a rough man but i could be awful good to anybody i liked i ve had a rough time of it up yonder but i beat the game nearly ounces of dust was what i cleaned um while i was there goodness exclaimed miss colby obligingly sympathetic it must be an awful dirty place wherever it is and then her eyes closed the voice of the man from nome had a monotony in its very earnestness besides what dull talk was this of brooms and sweeping and dust she leaned her head back against the wall miss said the man from nome with deeper earnestness and monotony i never saw anybody i liked as well as i do you i know you can t think that way of me right yet but can t you give me a chance won t you let me know you and see if i can t make you like me the head of the girl from sieber mason s slid over gently and rested upon his shoulder sweet sleep had won her and she was dreaming rapturously of the wholesale fish dealers assistants ball the gentleman from nome kept his arms to himself he did not suspect sleep and yet he was too wise to attribute the movement to surrender he was greatly and blissfully thrilled but he ended by regarding the head upon his shoulder as an encouraging preliminary merely advanced as a harbinger of his success and not to be taken advantage of one small speck of alloy discounted the gold of his satisfaction had he spoken too freely of his wealth he wanted to be liked for himself i want to say miss he said that you can count on me they know me in the klondike from juneau to circle city and down the whole length of the yukon many a night i ve laid in the snow up there where i worked like a slave for three years and wondered if i d ever have anybody to like me i didn t want all that dust just myself i thought i d meet just the right one some tine and i done it to day money s a mighty good thing to have but to have the love of the one you like best is better still if you was ever to marry a man miss which would you rather he d have cash the word came sharply and loudly from miss colby s lips giving evidence that in her dreams she was now behind her counter in the great department store of sieber mason her head suddenly bobbed over sideways she awoke sat straight and rubbed her eyes the man from nome was gone gee i believe i ve been asleep said miss colby wonder what became of the white wings the tale of a tainted tenner money talks but you may think that the conversation of a little old ten dollar bill in new york would be nothing more than a whisper oh very well pass up this sotto voce autobiography of an x if you like if you are one of the kind that prefers to listen to john d s checkbook roar at you through a megaphone as it passes by all right but don t forget that small change can say a word to the point now and then the next time you tip your grocer s clerk a silver quarter to give you extra weight of his boss s goods read the four words above the lady s head how are they for repartee i am a ten dollar treasury note series of you may have seen one in a friend s hand on my face in the centre is a picture of the bison americanus miscalled a buffalo by fifty or sixty millions of americans the heads of capt lewis and capt clark adorn the ends on my back is the graceful figure of liberty or ceres or maxine elliot standing in the centre of the stage on a conservatory plant my references is or are section revised statutes ten cold hard dollars i don t say whether silver gold lead or iron uncle sam will hand you over his counter if you want to cash me in i beg you will excuse any conversational breaks that i make thanks i knew you would got that sneaking little respect and agreeable feeling toward even an x haven t you you see a tainted bill doesn t have much chance to acquire a correct form of expression i never knew a really cultured and educated person that could afford to hold a ten spot any longer than it would take to do an arthur duffy to the nearest that s all sign or delicatessen store for a six year old i ve had a lively and gorgeous circulation i guess i ve paid as many debts as the man who dies i ve been owned by a good many kinds of people but a little old ragged damp dingy five dollar silver certificate gave me a jar one day i was next to it in the fat and bad smelling purse of a butcher hey you sitting bull says i don t scrouge so anyhow don t you think it s about time you went in on a customs payment and got reissued for a series of you re a sight oh don t get crackly just because you re a buffalo bill says the fiver you d be limp too if you d been stuffed down in a thick cotton and lisle thread under an elastic all day and the thermometer not a degree under in the store i never heard of a pocketbook like that says i who carried you a shopgirl says the five spot what s that i had to ask you ll never know till their millennium comes says the fiver just then a two dollar bill behind me with a george washington head spoke up to the fiver aw cut out yer kicks ain t lisle thread good enough for yer if you was under all cotton like i ve been to day and choked up with factory dust till the lady with the cornucopia on me sneezed half a dozen times you d have some reason to complain that was the next day after i arrived in new york i came in a package of tens to a brooklyn bank from one of its pennsylvania correspondents and i haven t made the acquaintance of any of the five and two spot s friends pocketbooks yet silk for mine every time i was lucky money i kept on the move sometimes i changed hands twenty times a day i saw the inside of every business i fought for my owner s every pleasure it seemed that on saturday nights i never missed being slapped down on a bar tens were always slapped down while ones and twos were slid over to the bartenders folded i got in the habit of looking for mine and i managed to soak in a little straight or some spilled martini or manhattan whenever i could once i got tied up in a great greasy roll of bills in a pushcart peddler s jeans i thought i never would get in circulation again for the future department store owner lived on eight cents worth of dog meat and onions a day but this peddler got into trouble one day on account of having his cart too near a crossing and i was rescued i always will feel grateful to the cop that got me he changed me at a cigar store near the bowery that was running a crap game in the back room so it was the captain of the precinct after all that did me the best turn when he got his he blew me for wine the next evening in a broadway restaurant and i really felt as glad to get back again as an astor does when he sees the lights of charing cross a tainted ten certainly does get action on broadway i was alimony once and got folded in a little dogskin purse among a lot of dimes they were bragging about the busy times there were in ossining whenever three girls got hold of one of them during the ice cream season but it s slow moving vehicles keep to the right for the little bok tips when you think of the way we bison plasters refuse to stick to anything during the rush lobster hour the first i ever heard of tainted money was one night when a good thing with a van to his name threw me over with some other bills to buy a stack of blues about midnight a big easy going man with a fat face like a monk s and the eye of a janitor with his wages raised tooks me and a lot of other notes and rolled us into what is termed a wad among the money tainters ticket me for five hundred said he to the banker and look out for everything charlie i m going out for a stroll in the glen before the moonlight fades from the brow of the cliff if anybody finds the roof in their way there s wrapped in a comic supplement in the upper left hand corner of the safe be bold everywhere be bold but be not bowled over night i found myself between two gold certificates one of em says to me well old shorthorn you re in luck to night you ll see something of life old jack s going to make the tenderloin look like a hamburg steak explain says i i m used to joints but i don t care for filet mignon with the kind of sauce you serve xcuse me said the twenty old jack is the proprietor of this gambling house he s going on a whiz to night because he offered to a church and it refused to accept it because they said his money was tainted what is a church i asked oh i forgot says the twenty that i was talking to a tenner of course you don t know you re too much to put into the contribution basket and not enough to buy anything at a bazaar a church is a large building in which penwipers and tidies are sold at each i don t care much about chinning with gold certificates there s a streak of yellow in em all is not gold that s quitters old jack certainly was a gild edged sport when it came his time to loosen up he never referred the waiter to an actuary by and by it got around that be was smiting the rock in the wilderness and all along broadway things with cold noses and hot gullets fell in on our trail the third jungle book was there waiting for somebody to put covers on it old jack s money may have had a taint to it but all the same he had orders for his camembert piling up on him every minute first his friends rallied round him and then the fellows that his friends knew by sight and then a few of his enemies buried the hatchet and finally he was buying souvenirs for so many neapolitan fisher maidens and butterfly octettes that the head waiters were phoning all over town for julian mitchell to please come around and get them into some kind of order at last we floated into an uptown cafe that i knew by heart when the hod carriers union in jackets and aprons saw us coming the chief goal kicker called out six eleven forty two nineteen twelve to his men and they put on nose guards till it was clear whether we meant port arthur or portsmouth but old jack wasn t working for the furniture and glass factories that night he sat down quiet and sang ramble in a half hearted way his feelings had been hurt so the twenty told me because his offer to the church had been refused but the wassail went on and brady himself couldn t have hammered the thirst mob into a better imitation of the real penchant for the stuff that you screw out of a bottle with a napkin old jack paid the twenty above me for a round leaving me on the outside of his roll he laid the roll on the table and sent for the proprietor mike says he here s money that the good people have refused will it buy of your wares in the name of the devil they say it s tainted i will says mike and i ll put it in the drawer next to the bills that was paid to the parson s daughter for kisses at the church fair to build a new parsonage for the parson s daughter to live in at o clock when the hod carriers were making ready to close up the front and keep the inside open a woman slips in the door of the restaurant and comes up to old jack s table you ve seen the kind black shawl creepy hair ragged skirt white face eyes a cross between gabriel s and a sick kitten s the kind of woman that s always on the lookout for an automobile or the mendicancy squad and she stands there without a word and looks at the money old jack gets up peels me off the roll and hands me to her with a bow madam says he just like actors i ve heard here is a tainted bill i am a gambler this bill came to me to night from a gentleman s son where he got it i do not know if you will do me the favor to accept it it is yours the woman took me with a trembling hand sir said she i counted thousands of this issue of bills into packages when they were virgin from the presses i was a clerk in the treasury department there was an official to whom i owed my position you say they are tainted now if you only knew but i won t say any more thank you with all my heart sir thank you thank you where do you suppose that woman carried me almost at a run to a bakery away from old jack and a sizzling good time to a bakery and i get changed and she does a sheridan twenty miles away with a dozen rolls and a section of jelly cake as big as a turbine water wheel of course i lost sight of her then for i was snowed up in the bakery wondering whether i d get changed at the drug store the next day in an alum deal or paid over to the cement works a week afterward i butted up against one of the one dollar bills the baker had given the woman for change hallo e says i weren t you in the change for me in a bakery last saturday night yep says the solitaire in his free and easy style how did the deal turn out i asked she blew e for mills and round steak says the one spot she kept me till the rent man came it was a bum room with a sick kid in it but you ought to have seen him go for the bread and tincture of formaldehyde half starved i guess then she prayed some don t get stuck up tenner we one spots hear ten prayers where you hear one she said something about who giveth to the poor oh let s cut out the slum talk i m certainly tired of the company that keeps me i wish i was big enough to move in society with you tainted bills shut up says i there s no such thing i know the rest of it there s a lendeth to the lord somewhere in it now look on my back and read what you see there this note is a legal tender at its face value for all debts public and private this talk about tainted money makes me tired says i elsie in new york no bumptious reader this story is not a continuation of the elsie series but if your elsie had lived over here in our big city there might have been a chapter in her books not very different from this especially for the vagrant feet of youth are the roads of manhattan beset with pitfall and with gin but the civic guardians of the young have made themselves acquainted with the snares of the wicked and most of the dangerous paths are patrolled by their agents who seek to turn straying ones away from the peril that menaces them and this will tell you how they guided my elsie safely through all peril to the goal that she was seeking elsie s father had been a cutter for fox otter cloaks and furs on lower broadway he was an old man with a slow and limping gait so a pot hunter of a newly licensed chauffeur ran him down one day when livelier game was scarce they took the old man home where he lay on his bed for a year and then died leaving in cash and a letter from mr otter offering to do anything he could to help his faithful old employee the old cutter regarded this letter as a valuable legacy to his daughter and he put it into her hands with pride as the shears of the dread cleaner and repairer snipped off his thread of life that was the landlord s cue and forth he came and did his part in the great eviction scene there was no snowstorm ready for elsie to steal out into drawing her little red woollen shawl about her shoulders but she went out regardless of the unities and as for the red shawl back to blaney with it elsie s fall tan coat was cheap but it had the style and fit of the best at fox otter s and her lucky stars had given her good looks and eyes as blue and innocent as the new shade of note paper and she had left of the and the letter from mr otter keep your eye on the letter from mr otter that is the clue i desire that everything be made plain as we go detective stories are so plentiful now that they do not sell and so we find elsie thus equipped starting out in the world to seek her fortune one trouble about the letter from mr otter was that it did not bear the new address of the firm which had moved about a month before but elsie thought she could find it she had heard that policemen when politely addressed or thumbscrewed by an investigation committee will give up information and addresses so she boarded a downtown car at one hundred and seventy seventh street and rode south to forty second which she thought must surely be the end of the island there she stood against the wall undecided for the city s roar and dash was new to her up where she had lived was rural new york so far out that the milkmen awaken you in the morning by the squeaking of pumps instead of the rattling of cans a kind faced sunburned young man in a soft brimmed hat went past elsie into the grand central depot that was hank ross of the sunflower ranch in idaho on his way home from a visit to the east hank s heart was heavy for the sunflower ranch was a lonesome place lacking the presence of a woman he had hoped to find one during his visit who would congenially share his prosperity and home but the girls of gotham had not pleased his fancy but as he passed in he noted with a jumping of his pulses the sweet ingenuous face of elsie and her pose of doubt and loneliness with true and honest western impulse he said to himself that here was his mate he could love her he knew and he would surround her with so much comfort and cherish her so carefully that she would be happy and make two sunflowers grow on the ranch where there grew but one before hank turned and went back to her backed by his never before questioned honesty of purpose he approached the girl and removed his soft brimmed hat elsie had but time to sum up his handsome frank face with one shy look of modest admiration when a burly cop hurled himself upon the ranchman seized him by the collar and backed him against the wall two blocks away a burglar was coming out of an apartment house with a bag of silverware on his shoulder but that is neither here nor there carry on yez mashin tricks right before me eyes will yez shouted the cop i ll teach yez to speak to ladies on me beat that ye re not acquainted with come along elsie turned away with a sigh as the ranchman was dragged away she had liked the effect of his light blue eyes against his tanned complexion she walked southward thinking herself already in the district where her father used to work and hoping to find some one who could direct her to the firm of fox otter but did she want to find mr otter she had inherited much of the old cutter s independence how much better it would be if she could find work and support herself without calling on him for aid elsie saw a sign employment agency and went in many girls were sitting against the wall in chairs several well dressed ladies were looking them over one white haired kind faced old lady in rustling black silk hurried up to elsie my dear she said in a sweet gentle voice are you looking for a position i like your face and appearance so much i want a young woman who will be half maid and half companion to me you will have a good home and i will pay you a month before elsie could stammer forth her gratified acceptance a young woman with gold glasses on her bony nose and her hands in her jacket pockets seized her arm and drew her aside i am miss ticklebaum said she of the association for the prevention of jobs being put up on working girls looking for jobs we prevented forty seven girls from securing positions last week i am here to protect you beware of any one who offers you a job how do you know that this woman does not want to make you work as a breaker boy in a coal mine or murder you to get your teeth if you accept work of any kind without permission of our association you will be arrested by one of our agents but what am i to do asked elsie i have no home or money i must do something why am i not allowed to accept this kind lady s offer i do not know said miss ticklebaum that is the affair of our committee on the abolishment of employers it is my duty simply to see that you do not get work you will give me your name and address and report to our secretary every thursday we have girls on the waiting list who will in time be allowed to accept positions as vacancies occur on our roll of qualified employers which now comprises twenty seven names there is prayer music and lemonade in our chapel the third sunday of every month elsie hurried away after thanking miss ticklebaum for her timely warning and advice after all it seemed that she must try to find mr otter but after walking a few blocks she saw a sign cashier wanted in the window of a confectionery store in she went and applied for the place after casting a quick glance over her shoulder to assure herself that the job preventer was not on her trail the proprietor of the confectionery was a benevolent old man with a peppermint flavor who decided after questioning elsie pretty closely that she was the very girl he wanted her services were needed at once so elsie with a thankful heart drew off her tan coat and prepared to mount the cashier s stool but before she could do so a gaunt lady wearing steel spectacles and black mittens stood before her with a long finger pointing and exclaimed young woman hesitate elsie hesitated do you know said the black and steel lady that in accepting this position you may this day cause the loss of a hundred lives in agonizing physical torture and the sending as many souls to perdition why no said elsie in frightened tones how could i do that ruin said the lady the demon rum do you know why so many lives are lost when a theatre catches fire brandy balls the demon rum lurking in brandy balls our society women while in theatres sit grossly intoxicated from eating these candies filled with brandy when the fire fiend sweeps down upon them they are unable to escape the candy stores are the devil s distilleries if you assist in the distribution of these insidious confections you assist in the destruction of the bodies and souls of your fellow beings and in the filling of our jails asylums and almshouses think girl ere you touch the money for which brandy balls are sold dear me said elsie bewildered i didn t know there was rum in brandy balls but i must live by some means what shall i do decline the position said the lady and come with me i will tell you what to do after elsie had told the confectioner that she had changed her mind about the cashiership she put on her coat and followed the lady to the sidewalk where awaited an elegant victoria seek some other work said the black and steel lady and assist in crushing the hydra headed demon rum and she got into the victoria and drove away i guess that puts it up to mr otter again said elsie ruefully turning down the street and i m sorry too for i d much rather make my way without help near fourteenth street elsie saw a placard tacked on the side of a doorway that read fifty girls neat sewers wanted immediately on theatrical costumes good pay she was about to enter when a solemn man dressed all in black laid his hand on her arm my dear girl he said i entreat you not to enter that dressing room of the devil goodness me exclaimed elsie with some impatience the devil seems to have a cinch on all the business in new york what s wrong about the place it is here said the solemn man that the regalia of satan in other words the costumes worn on the stage are manufactured the stage is the road to ruin and destruction would you imperil your soul by lending the work of your hands to its support do you know my dear girl what the theatre leads to do you know where actors and actresses go after the curtain of the playhouse has fallen upon them for the last time sure said elsie into vaudeville but do you think it would be wicked for me to make a little money to live on by sewing i must get something to do pretty soon the flesh pots of egypt exclaimed the reverend gentleman uplifting his hands i beseech you my child to turn away from this place of sin and iniquity but what will i do for a living asked elsie i don t care to sew for this musical comedy if it s as rank as you say it is but i ve got to have a job the lord will provide said the solemn man there is a free bible class every sunday afternoon in the basement of the cigar store next to the church peace be with you amen farewell elsie went on her way she was soon in the downtown district where factories abound on a large brick building was a gilt sign posey trimmer artificial flowers below it was hung a newly stretched canvas hearing the words five hundred girls wanted to learn trade good wages from the start apply one flight up elsie started toward the door near which were gathered in groups some twenty or thirty girls one big girl with a black straw hat tipped down over her eyes stepped in front of her say you se said the girl are you se goin in there after a job yes said elsie i must have work now don t do it said the girl i m chairman of our scab committee there s of us girls locked out just because we demanded cents a week raise in wages and ice water and for the foreman to shave off his mustache you re too nice a looking girl to be a scab wouldn t you please help us along by trying to find a job somewhere else or would you se rather have your face pushed in i ll try somewhere else said elsie she walked aimlessly eastward on broadway and there her heart leaped to see the sign fox otter stretching entirely across the front of a tall building it was as though an unseen guide had led her to it through the by ways of her fruitless search for work she hurried into the store and sent in to mr otter by a clerk her name and the letter he had written her father she was shown directly into his private office mr otter arose from his desk as elsie entered and took both hands with a hearty smile of welcome he was a slightly corpulent man of nearly middle age a little bald gold spectacled polite well dressed radiating well well and so this is beatty s little daughter your father was one of our most efficient and valued employees he left nothing well well i hope we have not forgotten his faithful services i am sure there is a vacancy now among our models oh it is easy work nothing easier mr otter struck a bell a long nosed clerk thrust a portion of himself inside the door send miss hawkins in said mr otter miss hawkins came miss hawkins said mr otter bring for miss beatty to try on one of those russian sable coats and let s see one of those latest model black tulle hats with white tips elsie stood before the full length mirror with pink cheeks and quick breath her eyes shone like faint stars she was beautiful alas she was beautiful i wish i could stop this story here confound it i will no it s got to run it out i didn t make it up i m just repeating it i d like to throw bouquets at the wise cop and the lady who rescues girls from jobs and the prohibitionist who is trying to crush brandy balls and the sky pilot who objects to costumes for stage people there are others and all the thousands of good people who are at work protecting young people from the pitfalls of a great city and then wind up by pointing out how they were the means of elsie reaching her father s benefactor and her kind friend and rescuer from poverty this would make a fine elsie story of the old sort i d like to do this but there s just a word or two to follow while elsie was admiring herself in the mirror mr otter went to the telephone booth and called up some number don t ask me what it was oscar said he i want you to reserve the same table for me this evening what why the one in the moorish room to the left of the shrubbery yes two yes the usual brand and the johannisburger with the roast if it isn t the right temperature i ll break your neck no not her no indeed a new one a peacherino oscar a peacherino tired and tiresome reader i will conclude if you please with a paraphrase of a few words that you will remember were written by him by him of gad s hill before whom if you doff not your hat you shall stand with a covered pumpkin aye sir a pumpkin lost your excellency lost associations and societies lost right reverends and wrong reverends of every order lost reformers and lawmakers born with heavenly compassion in your hearts but with the reverence of money in your souls and lost thus around us every day the voice of the city the voice of the city twenty five years ago the school children used to chant their lessons the manner of their delivery was a singsong recitative between the utterance of an episcopal minister and the drone of a tired sawmill i mean no disrespect we must have lumber and sawdust i remember one beautiful and instructive little lyric that emanated from the physiology class the most striking line of it was this the shin bone is the long est bone in the hu man bod y what an inestimable boon it would have been if all the corporeal and spiritual facts pertaining to man bad thus been tunefully and logically inculcated in our youthful minds but what we gained in anatomy music and philosophy was meagre the other day i became confused i needed a ray of light i turned back to those school days for aid but in all the nasal harmonies we whined forth from those bard benches i could not recall one that treated of the voice of agglomerated mankind in other words of the composite vocal message of massed humanity in other words of the voice of a big city now the individual voice is not lacking we can understand the song of the poet the ripple of the brook the meaning of the man who wants until next monday the inscriptions on the tombs of the pharaohs the language of flowers the step lively of the conductor and the prelude of the milk cans at a m certain large eared ones even assert that they are wise to the vibrations of the tympanum pro need by concussion of the air emanating from mr h james but who can comprehend the meaning of the voice of the city i went out for to see first i asked aurelia she wore white swiss and a bat with flowers on it and ribbons and ends of things fluttered here and there tell me i said stammeringly for i have no voice of my own what does this big er enormous er whopping city say it must have a voice of some kind does it ever speak to you how do you interpret its meaning it is a tremen dous mass but it must have a key like a saratoga trunk asked aurelia no said i please do not refer to the lid i have a fancy that every city has a voice each one has something to say to the one who can hear it what does the big one say to you all cities said aurelia judicially say the same thing when they get through saying it there is an echo from philadelphia so they are unanimous here are people said i scholastic ally compressed upon an island which is mostly lamb surrounded by wall street water the conjunc tion of so many units into so small a space must result in an identity or or rather a homogeneity that finds its oral expression through a common chan nel it is as you might say a consensus of transla tion concentrating in a crystallized general idea which reveals itself in what may be termed the voice of the city can you tell me what it is aurelia smiled wonderfully she sat on the high stoop a spray of insolent ivy bobbed against her right ear a ray of impudent moonlight flickered upon her nose but i was adamant nickel plated i must go and find out i said what is the voice of this city other cities have voices it is an assignment i must have it new york i con tinned in a rising tone had better not hand me a cigar and say old man i can t talk for publication no other city acts in that way chicago says unhes itatingly i will i philadelphia says i should new orleans says i used to louisville says don t care if i do st louis says excuse me pittsburg says smoke up now new york aurelia smiled very well said i i must go elsewhere and find out i went into a palace tile floored cherub ceilinged and square with the cop i put my foot on the brass rail and said to billy magnus the best bartender in the diocese billy you ve lived in new york a long time what kind of a song and dance does this old town give you what i mean is doesn t the gab of it seem to kind of bunch up and slide over the bar to you in a sort of amalgamated tip that bits off the burg in a kind of an epigram with a dash of bitters and a slice of excuse me a minute said billy somebody s punching the button at the side door he went away came back with an empty tin bucket again vanished with it full returned and said to me that was mame she rings twice she likes a glass of beer for supper her and the kid if you ever saw that little skeesicks of mine brace up in his high chair and take his beer and but say what was yours i get kind of excited when i bear them two rings was it the baseball score or gin fizz you asked for ginger ale i answered i walked up to broadway i saw a cop on the cor ner the cops take kids up women across and men in i went up to him if i m not exceeding the spiel limit i said let me ask you you see new york during its vocative hours it is the function of you and your brother cops to preserve the acoustics of the city there must be a civic voice that is intelligible to you at night during your lonely rounds you must have beard it what is the epitome of its turmoil and shouting what does the city say to you friend said the policeman spinning his club it don t say nothing i get my orders from the man higher up say i guess you re all right stand here for a few minutes and keep an eye open for the roundsman the cop melted into the darkness of the side street in ten minutes be had returned married last tuesday be said half gruffly you know bow they are she comes to that corner at nine every night for a comes to say hello i generally manage to be there say what was it you asked me a bit ago what s doing in the city oh there s a roof garden or two just opened twelve blocks up i crossed a crow s foot of street car tracks and skirted the edge of an umbrageous park an artificial diana gilded heroic poised wind ruled on the tower shimmered in the clear light of her namesake in the sky along came my poet hurry ing hatted haired emitting dactyls spondees and dactylis i seized him bill said i in the magazine he is cleon give me a lift i am on an assignment to find out the voice of the city you see it s a special order ordi narily a symposium comprising the views of henry clews john l sullivan edwin markham may ir win and charles schwab would be about all but this is a different matter we want a broad poetic mystic vocalization of the city s soul and meaning you are the very chap to give me a hint some years ago a man got at the niagara falls and gave us its pitch the note was about two feet below the lowest g on the piano now you can t put new york into a note unless it s better indorsed than that but give me an idea of what it would say if it should speak it is bound to be a mighty and far reaching utterance to arrive at it we must take the tremendous crash of the chords of the day s traffic the laughter and music of the night the solemn tones of dr parkhurst the rag time the weeping the stealthy bum of cab wbeels the shout of the press agent the tinkle of fountains on the roof gardens the hullabaloo of the strawberry vender and the covers of everybody s magazine the whispers of the lovers in the parks all these sounds must go into your voice not combined but mixed and of the mixture an essence made and of the es sence an extract an audible extract of which one drop shall form the thing we seek do you remember asked the poet with a chuckle that california girl we met at stiver s studio last week well i m on my way to see her she repeated that poem of mine the tribute of spring word for word she s the smartest proposi tion in this town just at present say how does this confounded tie look i spoiled four before i got one to set right and the voice that i asked you about i in quired oh she doesn t sing said cleon but you ought to bear her recite my angel of the inshore wind i passed on i cornered a newsboy and be flashed at me prophetic pink papers that outstripped the news by two revolutions of the clock s longest hand son i said while i pretended to chase coins in my penny pocket doesn t it sometimes seem to you as if the city ought to be able to talk all these ups and downs and funny business and queer things hap pening every daywhat would it say do you think if it could speak quit yer kiddin said the boy wot paper yer want i got no time to waste it s mag s birthday and i want thirty cents to git her a present here was no interpreter of the city s mouthpiece i bought a paper and consigned its undeclared treaties its premeditated murders and unfought bat tles to an ash can again i repaired to the park and sat in the moon shade i thought and thought and wondered why none could tell me what i asked for and then as swift as light from a fixed star the answer came to me i arose and hurried hurried as so many reasoners must back around my circle i knew the answer and i bugged it in my breast as i flew fearing lest some one would stop me and demand my secret aurelia was still on the stoop the moon was higher and the ivy shadows were deeper i sat at her side and we watched a little cloud tilt at the drifting moon and go asunder quite pale and discomfited and then wonder of wonders and delight of de lights our hands somehow touched and our fingers closed together and did not part after half an hour aurelia said with that smile of hers do you know you haven t spoken a word since you came back that said i nodding wisely is the voice of the city the complete life of john hopkins there is a saying that no man has tasted the full flavor of life until he has known poverty love and war the justness of this reflection commends it to the lover of condensed philosophy the three condi tions embrace about all there is in life worth knowing a surface thinker might deem that wealth should be added to the list not so when a poor man finds a long bidden quarter dollar that has slipped through a rip into his vest lining be sounds the pleasure of life with a deeper plummet than any millionaire can hope to cast it seems that the wise executive power that rules life has thought best to drill man in these three con ditions and none may escape all three in rural places the terms do not mean so much poverty is less pinching love is temperate war shrinks to con tests about boundary lines and the neighbors hens it is in the cities that our epigram gains in truth and vigor and it has remained for one john hopkins to crowd the experience into a rather small space of time the hopkins flat was like a thousand others there was a rubber plant in one window a flea bitten terrier sat in the other wondering when he was to have his day john hopkins was like a thousand others he worked at per week in a nine story red brick building at either insurance buckle s hoisting en gines chiropody loans pulleys boas renovated waltz guaranteed in five lessons or artificial limbs it is not for us to wring mr hopkins s avo cation from these outward signs that be mrs hopkins was like a thousand others the auriferous tooth the sedentary disposition the sun day afternoon wanderlust the draught upon the delicatessen store for home made comforts the furor for department store marked down sales the feeling of superiority to the lady in the third floor front who wore genuine ostrich tips and had two names over her bell the mucilaginous hours during which she remained glued to the window sill the vigi lant avoidance of the instalment man the tireless patronage of the acoustics of the dumb waiter shaft all the attributes of the gotham flat dweller were hers one moment yet of sententiousness and the story moves in the big city large and sudden things happen you round a corner and thrust the rib of your um brella into the eye of your old friend from kootenai falls you stroll out to pluck a sweet william in the park and lo bandits attack you you are am bulanced to the hospital you marry your nurse are divorced get squeezed while short on u p s and d w n s stand in the bread line marry an heiress take out your laundry and pay your club dues seemingly all in the wink of an eye you travel the streets and a finger beckons to you a handkerchief is dropped for you a brick is dropped upon you the elevator cable or your bank breaks a table d hote or your wife disagrees with you and fate tosses you about like cork crumbs in wine opened by an un feed waiter the city is a sprightly young ster and you are red paint upon its toy and you get licked off john hopkins sat after a compressed dinner in his glove fitting straight front flat he sat upon a hornblende couch and gazed with satiated eyes at art brought home to the people in the shape of the storm tacked against the wall mrs hop kins discoursed droningly of the dinner smells from the flat across the ball the flea bitten terrier gave hopkins a look of disgust and showed a man hating tooth here was neither poverty love nor war but upon such barren stems may be grafted those essentials of a complete life john hopkins sought to inject a few raisins of conversation into the tasteless dough of existence putting a new elevator in at the office he said discarding the nominative noun and the boss has turned out his whiskers you don t mean it commented mrs hopkins mr whipples continued john wore his new spring suit down to day i liked it fine it s a gray with he stopped suddenly stricken by a need that made itself known to him i believe i ll walk down to the corner and get a five cent cigar he concluded john hopkins took his bat aid picked his way down the musty halls and stairs of the flat house the evening air was mild and the streets shrill with the careless cries of children playing games con trolled by mysterious rhythms and phrases their elders held the doorways and steps with leisurely pipe and gossip paradoxically the fire escapes sup ported lovers in couples who made no attempt to fly the mounting conflagration they were there to fan the corner cigar store aimed at by john hopkins was kept by a man named freshmayer who looked upon the earth as a sterile promontory hopkins unknown in the store entered and called genially for his bunch of spinach car fare grade this imputation deepened the pessimism of fresh mayer but be set out a brand that came perilously near to filling the order hopkins bit off the roots of his purchase and lighted up at the swinging gas jet feeling in his pockets to make payment he found not a penny there say my friend he explained frankly i ve come out without any change hand you that nickel first time i pass joy surged in freshmayer s heart here was cor roboration of his belief that the world was rotten and man a peripatetic evil without a word he rounded the end of his counter and made earnest onslaught upon his customer hopkins was no man to serve as a punching bag for a pessimistic tobacconist he quickly bestowed upon freshmayer a colorado maduro eye in return for the ardent kick that be received from that dealer in goods for cash only the impetus of the enemy s attack forced the hopkins line back to the sidewalk there the con flict raged the pacific wooden indian with his carven smile was overturned and those of the street who delighted in carnage pressed round to view the zealous joust but then came the inevitable cop and imminent convenience for both the attacker and attacked john hopkins was a peaceful citizen who worked at rebuses of nights in a flat but be was not without the fundamental spirit of resistance that comes with the battle rage he knocked the policeman into a gro cer s sidewalk display of goods and gave freshmayer a punch that caused him temporarily to regret that he had not made it a rule to extend a five cent line of credit to certain customers then hopkins took spiritedly to his heels down the sidewalk closely fol lowed by the cigar dealer and the policeman whose uniform testified to the reason in the grocer s sign that read eggs cheaper than anywhere else in the city as hopkins ran he became aware of a big low red racing automobile that kept abreast of him in the street this auto steered in to the side of the sidewalk and the man guiding it motioned to hopkins to jump into it he did so without slackening his speed and fell into the turkey red upholstered seat beside the chauffeur the big machine with a dimin uendo cough flew away like an albatross down the avenue into which the street emptied the driver of the auto sped his machine without a word he was masked beyond guess in the goggles and diabolic garb of the chauffeur much obliged old man called hopkins grate fully i guess you ve got sporting blood in you all right and don t admire the sight of two men trying to soak one little more and i d have been pinched the chauffeur made no sign that he had heard hopkins shrugged a shoulder and chewed at his cigar to which his teeth had clung grimly through out the melee ten minutes and the auto turned into the open carriage entrance of a noble mansion of brown stone and stood still the chauffeur leaped out and said come quick the lady she will explain it is the great honor you will have monsieur ah that milady could call upon armand to do this thing but no i am only one chauffeur with vehement gestures the chauffeur conducted hopkins into the house he was ushered into a small but luxurious reception chamber a lady young and possessing the beauty of visions rose from a chair in her eyes smouldered a becoming anger her high arched threadlike brows were ruffled into a delicious frown milady said the chauffeur bowing low i have the honor to relate to you that i went to the house of monsieur long and found him to be not at home as i came back i see this gentleman in combat against bow you say greatest odds he is fighting with five ten thirty men gendarmes aussi yes milady he what you call swat one three eight policemans if that monsieur long is out i say to myself this

in this house who has treated me with insult and abuse i have complained to my aunt and she laughs at me ar mand says you are brave in these prosaic days men who are both brave and chivalrous are few may i count upon your assistance john hopkins thrust the remains of his cigar into his coat pocket he looked upon this winning creature and felt his first thrill of romance it was a knightly love and contained no disloyalty to the flat with the flea bitten terrier and the lady of his choice he bad married her after a picnic of the lady label stickers union lodge no on a dare and a bet of new hats and chowder all around with his friend billy mcmanus this angel who was begging him to come to her rescue was something too heavenly for chowder and as for hats golden jewelled crowns for her say said john hopkins just show me the guy that you ve got the grouch at i ve neglected my talents as a scrapper heretofore but this is my busy night he is in there said the lady pointing to a closed door come are you sure that you do not falter or fear me said john hopkins just give me one of those roses in the bunch you are wearing will you the lady gave him a red red rose john hopkins kissed it stuffed it into his vest pocket opened the door and walked into the room it was a handsome library softly but brightly lighted a young man was there reading books on etiquette is what you want to study said john hopkins abruptly get up here and i ll give you some lessors be rude to a lady will you the young man looked mildly surprised then he arose languidly dextrously caught the arms of john hopkins and conducted him irresistibly to the front door of the house beware ralph branscombe cried the lady who had followed what you do to the gallant man who has tried to protect me the young man shoved john hopkins gently out the door and then closed it bess he said calmly i wish you would quit reading historical novels how in the world did that fellow get in here armand brought him said the young lady i

or three people around the kennels come now let s go tell auntie we are in good humor again arm in arm they moved away john hopkins walked to his flat the janitor s five year old daughter was playing on the steps hopkins gave her a nice red rose and walked up stairs mrs hopkins was philandering with curl papers get your cigar she asked disinterestedly sure said hopkins and i knocked around a while outside it s a nice night he sat upon the hornblende sofa took out the stump of his cigar lighted it and gazed at the grace ful figures in the storm on the opposite wall i was telling you said he about mr whipple s suit it s a gray with an invisible check and it looks fine a lickpenny lover there were girls in the biggest store masie was one of them she was eighteen and a selleslady in the gents gloves here she became versed in two varieties of human beings the kind of gents who buy their gloves in department stores and the kind of women who buy gloves for unfortunate gents besides this wide knowledge of the human species masie had acquired other information she had listened to the promulgated wisdom of the other girls and had stored it in a brain that was as secretive and wary as that of a maltese cat per haps nature foreseeing that she would lack wise counsellors had mingled the saving ingredient of shrewdness along with her beauty as she has endowed the silver fox of the priceless fur above the other animals with cunning for masie was beautiful she was a deep tinted blonde with the calm poise of a lady who cooks butter cakes in a window she stood behind her counter in the biggest store and as you closed your band over the tape line for your glove measure you thought of hebe and as you looked again you wondered how she had come by minerva s eyes when the floorwalker was not looking masie chewed tutti frutti when he was looking she gazed up as if at the clouds and smiled wistfully that is the shopgirl smile and i enjoin you to shun it unless you are well fortified with callosity of the heart caramels and a congeniality for the capers of cupid this smile belonged to masie s recreation hours and not to the store but the floorwalker must have his own he is the shylock of the stores when be comes nosing around the bridge of his nose is a toll bridge it is goo goo eyes or git when be looks toward a pretty girl of course not all floor walkers are thus only a few days ago the papers printed news of one over eighty years of age one day irving carter painter millionaire trav eller poet automobilist happened to enter the big gest store it is due to him to add that his visit was not voluntary filial duty took him by the collar and dragged him inside while his mother philandered among the bronze and terra cotta statuettes carter strolled across to the glove counter in order to shoot a few minutes on the wing his need for gloves was genuine be had forgotten to bring a pair with him but his action hardly calls for apology be cause be had never heard of glove counter flirtations as he neared the vicinity of his fate be hesitated suddenly conscious of this unknown phase of cupid s less worthy profession three or four cheap fellows sonorously garbed were leaning over the counters wrestling with the mediatorial hand coverings while giggling girls played vivacious seconds to their lead upon the strident string of coquetry carter would have re treated but he had gone too far masie confronted him behind her counter with a questioning look in eyes as coldly beautifully warmly blue as the glint of summer sunshine on an iceberg drifting in southern seas and then irving carter painter millionaire etc felt a warm flush rise to his aristocratically pale face but not from diffidence the blush was intellectual in origin he knew in a moment that he stood in the ranks of the ready made youths who wooed the gig gling girls at other counters himself leaned against the oaken trysting place of a cockney cupid with a desire in his heart for the favor of a glove salesgirl he was no more than bill and jack and mickey and then be felt a sudden tolerance for them and an elating courageous contempt for the conventions upon which he had fed and an unhesitating deter mination to have this perfect creature for his own when the gloves were paid for and wrapped the carter lingered for a moment the dimples at corners of masie s damask mouth deepened all gen tlemen who bought gloves lingered in just that way she curved an arm showing like psyche s through her shirt waist sleeve and rested an elbow upon the show case edge carter had never before encountered a situation of which he had not been perfect master but now he stood far more awkward than bill or jack or mickey he had no chance of meeting this beautiful girl so cially his mind struggled to recall the nature and habits of shopgirls as be had read or heard of them somehow be had received the idea that they some times did not insist too strictly upon the regular channels of introduction his heart beat loudly at the thought of proposing an unconventional meeting with this lovely and virginal being but the tumult in his heart gave him courage after a few friendly and well received remarks on general subjects he laid his card by her hand on the counter will you please pardon me he said if i seem too bold but i earnestly hope you will allow me the pleasure of seeing you again there is my name i assure you that it is with the greatest respect that i ask the favor of becoming one of your acquaintances may i not hope for the privilege masie knew men especially men who buy gloves without hesitation she looked him frankly and smil ingly in the eyes and said sure i guess you re all right i don t usually go out with strange gentlemen though it ain t quite ladylike when should you want to see me again as soon as i may said carter if you would allow me to call at your home i masie laughed musically oh gee no she said emphatically if you could see our flat once there s five of us in three rooms i d just like to see ma s face if i was to bring a gentleman friend there anywhere then said the enamored carter that will be convenient to you say suggested masie with a bright idea look in her peach blow face i guess thursday night will about suit me suppose you come to the corner of eighth avenue and forty eighth street at i live right near the corner but i ve got to be back home by eleven ma never lets me stay out after eleven carter promised gratefully to keep the tryst and then hastened to his mother who was looking about for him to ratify her purchase of a bronze diana a salesgirl with small eyes and an obtuse nose strolled near masie with a friendly leer did you make a hit with his nobs mase she asked familiarly the gentleman asked permission to call an swered masie with the grand air as she slipped car ter s card into the bosom of her waist permission to call echoed small eyes with a snigger did he say anything about dinner in the waldorf and a spin in his auto afterward oh cheese it said masie wearily you ve been used to swell things i don t think you ve had a swelled bead ever since that hose cart driver took you out to a chop suey joint no be never mentioned the waldorf but there s a fifth avenue address on his card and if be buys the supper you can bet your life there won t be no pigtail on the waiter what takes the order as carter glided away from the biggest store with his mother in his electric runabout he bit his lip with a dull pain at his heart he knew that love had come to him for the first time in all the twenty nine years of his life and that the object of it should make so readily an appointment with him at a street corner though it was a step toward his desires tor tured him with misgivings carter did not know the shopgirl he did not know that her home is often either a scarcely habit able tiny room or a domicile filled to overflowing with kith and kin the street corner is her parlor the park is her drawing room the avenue is her garden walk yet for the most part she is as inviolate mis tress of herself in them as is my lady inside her tapestried chamber one evening at dusk two weeks after their first meeting carter and masie strolled arm in arm into a little dimly lit park they found a bench tree shadowed and secluded and sat there for the first time his arm stole gently around her her golden bronze head slid restfully against his shoulder gee sighed masie thankfully why didn t you ever think of that before masie said carter earnestly you surely know that i love you i ask you sincerely to marry me you know me well enough by this time to have no doubts of me i want you and i must have you i care nothing for the difference in our stations what is the difference asked masie curi ously well there isn t any said carter quickly ex cept in the minds of foolish people it is in my power to give you a life of luxury my social position is be yond dispute and my means are ample they all say that remarked masie it s the kid they all give you i suppose you really work in a delicatessen or follow the races i ain t as green as i look i can furnish you all the proofs you want said carter gently and i want you masie i loved you the first day i saw you they all do said masie with an amused laugh to hear em talk if i could meet a man that got stuck on me the third time he d seen me i think i d get mashed on him please don t say such things pleaded carter listen to me dear ever since i first looked into your eyes you have been the only woman in the world for me oh ain t you the kidder smiled masie how many other girls did you ever tell that but carter persisted and at length be reached the flimsy fluttering little soul of the shopgirl that existed somewhere deep down in her lovely bosom his words penetrated the heart whose very lightness was its safest armor she looked up at him with eyes that saw and a warm glow visited her cool cheeks tremblingly awfully her moth wings closed and she seemed about to settle upon the flower of love some faint glimmer of life and its possibilities on the other side of her glove counter dawned upon her carter felt the change and crowded the opportunity marry me masie be whispered softly and we will go away from this ugly city to beautiful ones we will forget work and business and life will be one long holiday i know where i should take you i have been there often just think of a shore where summer is eternal where the waves are always rip pling on the lovely beach and the people are happy and free as children we will sail to those shores and remain there as long as you please in one of those far away cities there are grand and lovely palaces and towers full of beautiful pictures and statues the streets of the city are water and one travels about in i know said masie sitting up suddenly gondolas yes smiled carter i thought so said masie and then continued carter we will travel on and see whatever we wish in the world after the european cities we will visit india and the ancient cities there and ride on elephants and see the wonder ful temples of the hindoos and brahmins and the japanese gardens and the camel trains and chariot races in persia and all the queer sights of foreign countries don t you think you would like it masie masie rose to her feet i think we had better be going home she said coolly it s getting late carter humored her he had come to know her varying thistle down moods and that it was useless to combat them but he felt a certain happy triumph he had held for a moment though but by a silken thread the soul of his wild psyche and hope was stronger within him once she had folded her wings and her cool band bad closed about his own at the biggest store the next day masie s chum lulu waylaid her in an angle of the counter how are you and your swell friend making it she asked oh him said masie patting her side curls he ain t in it any more say lu what do you think that fellow wanted me to do go on the stage guessed lulu breathlessly nit he s too cheap a guy for that he wanted me to marry him and go down to coney island for a wedding tour dougherty s eye opener big jim dougherty was a sport he belonged to that race of men in manhattan it is a distinct race they are the caribs of the north strong artful self sufficient clannish honorable within the laws of their race holding in lenient contempt neigh boring tribes who bow to the measure of society s tapeline i refer of course to the titled nobility of sportdom there is a class which bears as a qualify ing adjective the substantive belonging to a wind in strument made of a cheap and base metal but the tin mines of cornwall never produced the material for manufacturing descriptive nomenclature for big jim dougherty the habitat of the sport is the lobby or the outside corner of certain hotels and combination restaurants and cafes they are mostly men of different sizes running from small to large but they are unanimous in the possession of a recently shaven blue black cheek and chin and dark overcoats in season with black velvet collars of the domestic life of the sport little is known it has been said that cupid and hymen sometimes take a band in the game and copper the queen of hearts to lose daring theorists have averred not content with simply saying that a sport often contracts a spouse and even incurs descendants sometimes he sits in the game of politics and then at chowder picnics there is a revelation of a mrs sport and little sports in glazed hats with tin pails but mostly the sport is oriental he believes his women folk should not be too patent somewhere be bind grilles or flower ornamented fire escapes they await him there no doubt they tread on rugs from teheran and are diverted by the bulbul and play upon the dulcimer and feed upon sweetmeats but away from his home the sport is an integer he does not as men of other races in manhattan do become the convoy in his unoccupied hours of fluttering laces and high heels that tick off delectably the happy seconds of the evening parade he herds with his own race at corners and delivers a commentary in his carib lingo upon the passing show big jim dougherty had a wife but be did not wear a button portrait of her upon his lapel he bad a home in one of those brown stone iron railed streets on the west side that look like a recently ex cavated bowling alley of pompeii to this home of his mr dougherty repaired each night when the hour was so late as to promise no further diversion in the arch domains of sport by that time the occupant of the monogamistic harem would be in dreamland the bulbul silenced and the hour propitious for slumber big jim always arose at twelve meridian for breakfast and soon afterward he would return to the rendezvous of his crowd he was always vaguely conscious that there was a mrs dougherty he would have received without denial the charge that the quiet neat comfortable little woman across the table at home was his wife in fact he remembered pretty well that they bad been married for nearly four years she would often tell him about the cute tricks of spot the canary and the light haired lady that lived in the window of the flat across the street big jim dougherty even listened to this con versation of hers sometimes he knew that she would have a nice dinner ready for him every evening at seven when he came for it she sometimes went to matinees and she bad a talking machine with six dozen records once when her uncle amos blew in on a wind from up state she went with him to the eden musee surely these things were diversions enough for any woman one afternoon mr dougherty finished his break fast put on his bat and got away fairly for the door when his hand was on the knob be heard his wife s voice jim she said firmly i wish you would take me out to dinner this evening it has been three years since you have been outside the door with me big jim was astounded she bad never asked anything like this before it had the flavor of a totally new proposition but he was a game sport all right be said you be ready when i come at seven none of this wait two minutes till i primp an hour or two kind of business now dele i ll be ready said his wife calmly at seven she descended the stone steps in the pom peian bowling alley at the side of big jim dough erty she wore a dinner gown made of a stuff that the spiders must have woven and of a color that a twilight sky must have contributed a light coat with many admirably unnecessary capes and adorably inutile ribbons floated downward from her shoulders fine feathers do make fine birds and the only re proach in the saying is for the man who refuses to give up his earnings to the ostrich tip industry big jim dougherty was troubled there was a being at his side whom be did not know he thought of the sober hued plumage that this bird of paradise was accustomed to wear in her cage and this winged revelation puzzled him in some way she reminded him of the delia cullen that be had married four years before shyly and rather awkwardly he stalked at her right band after dinner i ll take you back home dele said mr dougherty and then i ll drop back up to selt zer s with the boys you can have swell chuck to night if you want it i made a winning on anaconda yesterday so you can go as far as you like mr dougherty had intended to make the outing with his unwonted wife an inconspicuous one uxori ousness was a weakness that the precepts of the caribs did not countenance if any of his friends of the track the billiard cloth or the square circle had wives they had never complained of the fact in public there were a number of table d hote places on the cross streets near the broad and shining way and to one of these he had purposed to escort her so that the bushel might not be removed from the light of his domesticity but while on the way mr dougherty altered those intentions he had been casting stealthy glances at his attractive companion and he was seized with the conviction that she was no selling plater he re solved to parade with his wife past seltzer s cafe where at this time a number of his tribe would be gathered to view the daily evening procession yes and he would take her to dine at hoogley s the swell est slow lunch warehouse on the line he said to himself the congregation of smooth faced tribal gentle men were on watch at seltzer s as mr dougherty and his reorganized delia passed they stared mo mentarily petrified and then removed their hats a performance as unusual to them as was the astonish ing innovation presented to their gaze by big jim on the latter gentleman s impassive face there ap peared a slight flicker of triumph a faint flicker no more to be observed than the expression called there by the draft of little casino to a four card spade flush hoogley s was animated electric lights shone as indeed they were expected to do and the napery the glassware and the flowers also meritoriously per formed the spectacular duties required of them the guests were numerous well dressed and gay a waiter not necessarily obsequious conducted big jim dougherty and his wife to a table play that menu straight across for what you like dele said big jim it s you for a trough of the gilded oats to night it strikes me that maybe we ve been sticking too fast to home fodder big jim s wife gave her order he looked at her with respect she had mentioned truffles and be bad not known that she knew what truffles were from the wine list she designated an appropriate and de sirable brand he looked at her with some admiration she was beaming with the innocent excitement that woman derives from the exercise of her gregarious ness she was talking to him about a hundred things with animation and delight and as the meal pro gressed her cheeks colorless from a life indoors took on a delicate flush big jim looked around the room and saw that none of the women there had her charm and then he thought of the three years she had suffered immurement uncomplaining and a flush of shame warmed him for he carried fair play as an item in his creed but when the honorable patrick corrigan leader in dougherty s district and a friend of his saw them and came over to the table matters got to the three quarter stretch the honorable patrick was a gal lant man both in deeds and words as for the blar ney stone his previous actions toward it must have been pronounced heavy damages for breach of promise could surely have been obtained had the blarney stone seen fit to sue the honorable patrick jimmy old man he called he clapped dough erty on the back be shone like a midday sun upon delia honorable mr corrigan mrs dougherty said big jim the honorable patrick became a fountain of en tertainment and admiration the waiter had to fetch a third chair for him he made another at the table and the wineglasses were refilled you selfish old rascal he exclaimed shaking an arch finger at big jim to have kept mrs dougherty a secret from us and then big jim dougherty who was no talker sat dumb and saw the wife who had dined every evening for three years at home blossom like a fairy flower quick witty charming full of light and ready talk she received the experienced attack of the honorable patrick on the field of repartee and surprised vanquished delighted him she unfolded her long closed petals and around her the room became a garden they tried to include big jim in the conversation but he was without a vocabulary and then a stray bunch of politicians and good fellows who lived for sport came into the room they saw big jim and the leader and over they came and were made acquainted with mrs dougherty and in a few minutes she was holding a salon half a dozen men surrounded her courtiers all and six found her capable of charming big jim sat grim and kept saying to himself three years three years the dinner came to an end the honorable pat rick reached for mrs dougherty s cloak but that was a matter of action instead of words and dough erty s big band got it first by two seconds while the farewells were being said at the door the honorable patrick smote dougherty mightily between the shoulders jimmy me boy he declared in a giant whis per the madam is a jewel of the first water ye re a lucky dog big jim walked homeward with his wife she seemed quite as pleased with the lights and show windows in the streets as with the admiration of the men in hoogley s as they passed seltzer s they heard the sound of many voices in the cafe the boys would be starting the drinks around now and discussing past performances at the door of their home delia paused the pleasure of the outing radiated softly from her countenance she could not hope for jim of evenings but the glory of this one would tighten her lonely hours for a long time thank you for taking me out jim she said gratefully you ll be going back up to seltzer s now of course to with seltzer s said big jim em emphatically and d pat corrigan does he think i haven t got any eyes and the door closed behind both of them little speck in garnered fruit the honeymoon was at its full there was a flat with the reddest of new carpets tasselled portieres and six steins with pewter lids arranged on a ledge above the wainscoting of the dining room the won der of it was yet upon them neither of them had ever seen a yellow primrose by the river s brim but if such a sight had met their eyes at that time it would have seemed like well whatever the poet expected the right kind of people to see in it besides a prim rose the bride sat in the rocker with her feet resting upon the world she was wrapt in rosy dreams and a kimono of the same hue she wondered what the peo ple in greenland and tasmania and beloochistan were saying one to another about her marriage to kid mcgarry not that it made any difference there was no welter weight from london to the southern cross that could stand up four hours no four rounds with her bridegroom and he had been hers for three weeks and the crook of her little finger could sway him more than the fist of any pounder in the world love when it is ours is the other name for self abnegation and sacrifice when it belongs to people across the airshaft it means arrogance and self con ceit the bride crossed her oxfords and looked thought fully at the distemper cupids on the ceiling precious said she with the air of cleopatra asking antony for rome done up in tissue paper and delivered at residence i think i would like a peach kid mcgarry arose and put on his coat and hat he was serious shaven sentimental and spry all right said he as coolly as though be were only agreeing to sign articles to fight the champion of england i ll step down and cop one out for you see don t be long said the bride i ll be lonesome without my naughty boy get a nice ripe one after a series of farewells that would have befitted an imminent voyage to foreign parts the kid went down to the street here he not unreasonably hesitated for the season was yet early spring and there seemed small chance of wresting anywhere from those chill streets and stores the coveted luscious guerdon of summer s golden prime at the italian s fruit stand on the corner be stopped and cast a contemptuous eye over the dis play of papered oranges highly polished apples and wan sun hungry bananas gotta da peach asked the kid in the tongue of dante the lover of lovers ah no sighed the vender not for one mont com a da peach too soon gotta da nice a orange like a da orange scornful the kid pursued his quest he entered the all night chop house cafe and bowling alley of his friend and admirer justus o callahan the o callahan was about in his institution looking for leaks i want it straight said the kid to him the old woman has got a hunch that she wants a peach now if you ve got a peach cal get it out quick i want it and others like it if you ve got em in plural quantities the house is yours said o callahan but there s no peach in it it s too soon i don t sup pose you could even find em at one of the broadway joints that s too bad when a lady fixes her mouth for a certain kind of fruit nothing else won t do it s too late now to find any of the first class fruiterers open but if you think the missis would like some nice oranges i ve just got a box of fine ones in that she might much obliged cal it s a peach proposition right from the ring of the gong i ll try further the time was nearly midnight as the kid walked down the west side avenue few stores were open and such as were practically hooted at the idea of a peach but in her moated flat the bride confidently awaited her persian fruit a champion welter weight not find a peach not stride triumphantly over the seasons and the zodiac and the almanac to fetch an amsden s june or a georgia cling to his owny own the kid s eye caught sight of a window that was lighted and gorgeous with nature s most entrancing colors the light suddenly went out the kid sprinted and caught the fruiterer locking his door peaches said he with extreme deliberation well no sir not for three or four weeks yet i haven t any idea where you might find some there may be a few in town from under the glass but they d be bard to locate maybe at one of the more expen sive hotels some place where there s plenty of money to waste i ve got some very fine oranges though from a shipload that came in to day the kid lingered on the corner for a moment and then set out briskly toward a pair of green lights that flanked the steps of a building down a dark side street captain around anywhere he asked of the desk sergeant of the police station at that moment the captain came briskly forward from the rear he was in plain clothes and had a busy air hello kid he said to the pugilist thought you were bridal touring got back yesterday i m a solid citizen now think i ll take an interest in municipal doings how would it suit you to get into denver dick s place to night cap past performances said the captain twisting his moustache denver was closed up two months ago correct said the kid rafferty chased him out of the forty third he s running in your pre cinct now and his game s bigger than ever i m down on this gambling business i can put you against his game in my precinct growled the captain are you sure kid i ll take it as a favor have you got the entree how is it to be done hammers said the kid they haven t got any steel on the doors yet you ll need ten men no they won t let me in the place denver has been trying to do me he thought i tipped him off for the other raid i didn t though you want to hurry i ve got to get back home the house is only three blocks from here before ten minutes had sped the captain with a dozen men stole with their guide into the hallway of a dark and virtuous looking building in which many businesses were conducted by day third floor rear said the kid softly i ll lead the way two axemen faced the door that he pointed out to them it seems all quiet said the captain doubtfully are you sure your tip is straight cut away said the kid it s on me if it ain t the axes crashed through the as yet unprotected door a blaze of light from within poured through the smashed panels the door fell and the raiders rang into the room with their guns handy the big room was furnished with the gaudy mag nificence dear to denver dick s western ideas vari ous well patronized games were in progress about fifty men who were in the room rushed upon the police in a grand break for personal liberty the plain clothes men had to do a little club swinging more than half the patrons escaped denver dick had graced his game with his own presence that night he led the rush that was in tended to sweep away the smaller body of raiders but when be saw the kid his manner became personal being in the heavyweight class be cast himself joy fully upon his slighter enemy and they rolled down a flight of stairs in each others arms on the land ing they separated and arose and then the kid was able to use some of his professional tactics which had been useless to him while in the excited clutch of a pound sporting gentleman who was about to lose worth of paraphernalia after vanquishing his adversary the kid hurried upstairs and through the gambling room into a smaller apartment connecting by an arched doorway here was a long table set with choicest chinaware and silver and lavishly furnished with food of that expensive and spectacular sort of which the devotees of sport are supposed to be fond here again was to be perceived the liberal and florid taste of the gen tleman with the urban cognomenal prefix a no patent leather shoe protruded a few of its inches outside the tablecloth along the floor the kid seized this and plucked forth a black man in a white tie and the garb of a servitor get up commanded the kid are you in charge of this free lunch yes sah i was has they done pinched us ag in boss looks that way listen to me are there any peaches in this layout if there ain t i ll have to throw up the sponge there was three dozen sah when the game opened this evenin but i reckon the gentlemen done eat em all up if you d like to eat a fust rate orange sah i kin find you some get busy ordered the kid sternly and move whatever peach crop you ve got quick or there ll be trouble if anybody oranges me again to night i ll knock his face off the raid on denver dick s high priced and prodi gal luncheon revealed one lone last peach that had escaped the epicurean jaws of the followers of chance into the kid s pocket it went and that in defatigable forager departed immediately with his prize with scarcely a glance at the scene on the sidewalk below where the officers were loading their prisoners into the patrol wagons be moved homeward with long swift strides his heart was light as be went so rode the knights back to camelot after perils and high deeds done for their ladies fair the kid s lady had com manded him and be had obeyed true it was but a peach that she had craved but it had been no small deed to glean a peach at midnight from that wintry city where yet the february snows lay like iron she had asked for a peach she was his bride in his pocket the peach was warming in his band that held it for fear that it might fall out and be lost on the way the kid turned in at an all night drug store and said to the spectacled clerk say sport i wish you d size up this rib of mine and see if it s broke i was in a little scrap and bumped down a flight or two of stairs the druggist made an examination it isn t broken was his diagnosis but you have a bruise there that looks like you d fallen off the flatiron twice that s all right said the kid let s have your clothesbrush please the bride waited in the rosy glow of the pink lamp shade the miracles were not all passed away by breathing a desire for some slight thing a flower a pomegranate a oh yes a peach she could send forth her man into the night into the world which could not withstand him and he would do her bidding and now be stood by her chair and laid the peach in her band naughty boy she said fondly did i say a peach i think i would much rather have had an orange blest be the bride the harbinger long before the springtide is felt in the dull bosom of the yokel does the city man know that the grass green goddess is upon her throne he sits at his breakfast eggs and toast begirt by stone walls opens his morning paper and sees journalism leave vernal ism at the post for whereas spring s couriers were once the evi dence of our finer senses now the associated press does the trick the warble of the first robin in hackensack the stirring of the maple sap in bennington the bud ding of the pussy willows along main street in syra cuse the first chirp of the bluebird the swan song of the blue point the annual tornado in st louis the plaint of the peach pessimist from pompton n j the regular visit of the tame wild goose with a broken leg to the pond near bilgewater junction the base attempt of the drug trust to boost the price of quinine foiled in the house by congressman jinks the first tall poplar struck by lightning and the usual stunned picknickers who had taken refuge the first crack of the ice jam in the allegheny river the finding of a violet in its mossy bed by the correspondent at round corners these are the advance signs of the burgeoning season that are wired into the wise city while the farmer sees nothing but winter upon his dreary fields but these be mere externals the true harbinger is the heart when strephon seeks his chloe and mike his maggie then only is spring arrived and the newspaper report of the five foot rattler killed in squire pettigrew s pasture confirmed ere the first violet blew mr peters mr ragsdale and mr kidd sat together on a bench in union square and conspired mr peters was the d artag nan of the loafers there he was the dingiest the laziest the sorriest brown blot against the green back ground of any bench in the park but just then he was the most important of the trio mr peters had a wife this had not heretofore affected his standing with ragsy and kidd but to day it invested him with a peculiar interest his friends having escaped matrimony had shown a disposition to deride mr peters for his venture on that troubled sea but at last they had been forced to acknowledge that either he had been gifted with a large foresight or that he was one of fortune s lucky sons for mrs peters had a dollar a whole dollar bill good and receivable by the government for customs taxes and all public dues how to get possession of that dollar was the question up for discussion by the three musty musketeers how do you know it was a dollar asked ragsy the immensity of the sum inclining him to scepticism the coalman seen her have it said mr peters she went out and done some washing yesterday and look what she give me for breakfast the heel of a loaf and a cup of coffee and her with a dollar it s fierce said ragsy say we go up and punch er and stick a towel in er mouth and cop the coin suggested kidd viciously y ain t afraid of a woman are you she might holler and have us pinched demurred ragsy i don t believe in slugging no woman in a houseful of people gent men said mr peters severely through his russet stubble remember that you are speaking of my wife a man who would lift his hand to a lady except in the way of maguire said ragsy pointedly has got his bock beer sign out if we had a dollar we could hush up said mr peters licking his lips we got to get that case note somehow boys ain t what s a man s wife s his leave it to me i ll go over to the house and get it wait here for me i ve seen em give up quick and tell you where it s hid if you kick em in the ribs said kidd no man would kick a woman said peters vir tuously a little choking just a touch on the windpipe that gets away with em and no marks left wait for me i ll bring back that dollar boys high up in a tenement house between second ave nue and the river lived the peterses in a back room so gloomy that the landlord blushed to take the rent for it mrs peters worked at sundry times doing odd jobs of scrubbing and washing mr peters had a pure unbroken record of five years without having earned a penny and yet they clung together shar ing each other s hatred and misery being creatures of habit of habit the power that keeps the earth from flying to pieces though there is some silly theory of gravitation mrs peters reposed her pounds on the safer of the two chairs and gazed stolidly out the one win dow at the brick wall opposite her eyes were red and damp the furniture could have been carried away on a pushcart but no pushcart man would have removed it as a gift the door opened to admit mr peters his fox terrier eyes expressed a wish his wife s diagnosis located correctly the seat of it but misread it hun ger instead of thirst you ll get nothing more to eat till night she said looking out of the window again take your hound dog s face out of the room mr peters s eye calculated the distance between them by taking her by surprise it might be pos sible to spring upon her overthrow her and apply the throttling tactics of which he had boasted to his waiting comrades true it had been only a boast never yet had be dared to lay violent bands upon her but with the thoughts of the delicious cool bock or culmbacher bracing his nerves he was near to upsetting his own theories of the treatment due by a gentleman to a lady but with his loafer s love for the more artistic and less strenuous way he chose diplomacy first the high card in the game the as sumed attitude of success already attained you have a dollar he said loftily but signifi cantly in the tone that goes with the lighting of a cigar when the properties are at hand i have said mrs peters producing the bill from her bosom and crackling it teasingly i am offered a position in a in a tea store said mr peters i am to begin work to morrow but it will be necessary for me to buy a pair of you are a liar said mrs peters reinterring the note no tea store nor no a b c store nor no junk shop would have you i rubbed the skin off both me hands washin jumpers and overalls to make that dollar do you think it come out of them suds to buy the kind you put into you skiddoo get your mind off of money evidently the poses of talleyrand were not worth one hundred cents on that dollar but diplomacy is dexterous the artistic temperament of mr peters lifted him by the straps of his congress gaiters and set him on new ground he called up a look of des perate melancholy to his eyes clara he said hollowly to struggle further is useless you have always misunderstood me heaven knows i have striven with all my might to keep my head above the waves of misfortune but cut out the rainbow of hope and that stuff about walkin one by one through the narrow isles of spain said mrs peters with a sigh i ve heard it so often there s an ounce bottle of carbolic on the shelf behind the empty coffee can drink hearty mr peters reflected what next the old ex pedients had failed the two musty musketeers were awaiting him hard by the ruined chateau that is to say on a park bench with rickety cast iron legs his honor was at stake he had engaged to storm the castle single handed and bring back the treas ure that was to furnish them wassail and solace and all that stood between him and the coveted dollar was his wife once a little girl whom he could aha why not again once with soft words he could as they say twist her around his little finger why not again not for years had he tried it grim poverty and mutual hatred had killed all that but ragsy and kidd were waiting for him to bring the dollar mr peters took a surreptitiously keen look at his wife her formless bulk overflowed the chair she kept her eyes fixed out the window in a strange kind of trance her eyes showed that she had been re cently weeping i wonder said mr peters to himself if there d be anything in it the window was open upon its outlook of brick walls and drab barren back yards except for the mildness of the air that entered it might have been midwinter yet in the city that turns such a frown ing face to besieging spring but spring doesn t come with the thunder of cannon she is a sapper and a miner and you must capitulate i ll try it said mr peters to himself making a wry face he went up to his wife and put his arm across her shoulders clara darling he said in tones that shouldn t have fooled a baby seal why should we have hard words ain t you my own tootsum wootsums a black mark against you mr peters in the sa red ledger of cupid charges of attempted graft are filed against you and of forgery and utterance of two of love s holiest of appellations but the miracle of spring was wrought into the back room over the back alley between the black walls had crept the harbinger it was ridiculous and yet well it is a rat trap and you madam and sir and all of us are in it red and fat and crying like niobe or niagara mrs peters threw her arms around her lord and dissolved upon him mr peters would have striven to extricate the dollar bill from its deposit vault but his arms were bound to his sides do you love me james asked mrs peters madly said james but you are ill exclaimed mrs peters why are you so pale and tired looking i feel weak said mr peters i oh wait i know what it is wait james i ll be back in a minutes with a parting bug that revived in mr peters recollections of the terrible turk his wife hurried out of the room and down the stairs mr peters hitched his thumbs under his sus penders all right he confided to the ceiling i ve got her going i hadn t any idea the old girl was soft any more under the foolish rib well sir ain t i the claude melnotte of the lower east side what it s a to shot that i get the dollar i wonder what she went out for i guess she s gone to tell mrs muldoon on the second floor that we re recon ciled i ll remember this soft soap and ragsy was talking about slugging her mrs peters came back with a bottle of sarsapa rilla i m glad i happened to have that dollar she said you re all run down boney mr peters had a tablespoonful of the stuff in serted into him then mrs peters sat on his lap and murmured call me tootsum wootsums again james he sat still held there by his materialized goddess of spring spring had come on the bench in union square mr ragsdale and mr kidd squirmed tongue parched awaiting d artagnan and his dollar i wish i had choked her at first said mr peters to himself while the auto waits promptly at the beginning of twilight came again to that quiet corner of that quiet small park the girl in gray she sat upon a bench and read a book for there was yet to come a half hour in which print could be accomplished to repeat her dress was gray and plain enough to mask its impeccancy of style and fit a large meshed veil imprisoned her turban hat and a face that shone through it with a calm and unconscious beauty she had come there at the same hour on the day previous and on the day before that and there was one who knew it the young man who knew it hovered near relying upon burnt sacrifices to the great joss luck his piety was rewarded for in turning a page her book slipped from her fingers and bounded from the bench a full yard away the young man pounced upon it with instant avid ity returning it to its owner with that air that seems to flourish in parks and public places a compound of gallantry and hope tempered with respect for the policeman on the beat in a pleasant voice be risked an inconsequent remark upon the weather that in troductory topic responsible for so much of the world s unhappiness and stood poised for a mo ment awaiting his fate the girl looked him over leisurely at his ordinary neat dress and his features distinguished by nothing particular in the way of expression you may sit down if you like she said in a full deliberate contralto really i would like to have you do so the light is too bad for reading i would prefer to talk the vassal of luck slid upon the seat by her side with complaisance do you know be said speaking the formula with which park chairmen open their meetings that you are quite the stunningest girl i have seen in a long time i had my eye on you yesterday didn t know somebody was bowled over by those pretty lamps of yours did you honeysuckle whoever you are said the girl in icy tones you must remember that i am a lady i will excuse the remark you have just made because the mistake was doubtless not an unnatural one in your circle i asked you to sit down if the invitation must con stitute me your honeysuckle consider it with drawn i earnestly beg your pardon pleaded the young ran his expression of satisfaction had changed to one of penitence and humility it was my fault you know i mean there are girls in parks you know that is of course you don t know but abandon the subject if you please of course i know now tell me about these people passing and crowding each way along these paths where are they going why do they hurry so are they happy the young man had promptly abandoned his air of coquetry his cue was now for a waiting part he could not guess the role be would be expected to play it is interesting to watch them he replied pos tulating her mood it is the wonderful drama of life some are going to supper and some to er other places one wonders what their histories are i do not said the girl i am not so inquisi tive i come here to sit because here only can i be tear the great common throbbing heart of hu manity my part in life is cast where its beats are never felt can you surmise why i spoke to you mr parkenstacker supplied the young man then be looked eager and hopeful no said the girl holding up a slender finger and smiling slightly you would recognize it im mediately it is impossible to keep one s name out of print or even one s portrait this veil and this hat of my maid furnish me with an incog you should have seen the chauffeur stare at it when he thought i did not see candidly there are five or six names that belong in the holy of holies and mine by the accident of birth is one of them i spoke to you mr stackenpot parkenstacker corrected the young man mod estly mr parkenstacker because i wanted to talk for once with a natural man one unspoiled by the despicable gloss of wealth and supposed social su periority oh you do not know how weary i am of it money money money and of the men who surround me dancing like little marionettes all cut by the same pattern i am sick of pleasure of jewels of travel of society of luxuries of all kinds i always had an idea ventured the young man hesitatingly that money must be a pretty good thing a competence is to be desired but when you leave so many millions that she concluded the sentence with a gesture of despair it is the mo otony of it she continued that palls drives dinners theatres balls suppers with the gilding of superfluous wealth over it all sometimes the very tinkle of the ice in my champagne glass nearly drives me mad mr parkenstacker looked ingenuously interested i have always liked he said to read and hear about the ways of wealthy and fashionable folks i suppose i am a bit of a snob but i like to have my information accurate now i had formed the opin ion that champagne is cooled in the bottle and not by placing ice in the glass the girl gave a musical laugh of genuine amuse ment you should know she explained in an indul gent tone that we of the non useful class depend for our amusement upon departure from precedent just now it is a fad to put ice in champagne the idea was originated by a visiting prince of tartary while dining at the waldorf it will soon give way to some other whim just as at a dinner party this week on madison avenue a green kid glove was laid by the plate of each guest to be put on and used while eating olives i see admitted the young man humbly these special diversions of the inner circle do not become familiar to the common public sometimes continued the girl acknowledging his confession of error by a slight bow i have thought that if i ever should love a man it would be one of lowly station one who is a worker and not a drone but doubtless the claims of caste and wealth will prove stronger than my inclination just now i am besieged by two one is a grand duke of a german principality i think he has or has bad a wife somewhere driven mad by his intemperance and cruelty the other is an english marquis so cold and mercenary that i even prefer the diabolism of the duke what is it that impels me to tell you these things mr packenstacker parkenstacker breathed the young man in deed you cannot know how much i appreciate your confidences the girl contemplated him with the calm imper sonal regard that befitted the difference in their sta tions what is your line of business mr parken stacker she asked a very humble one but i hope to rise in the world were you really in earnest when you said that you could love a man of lowly position indeed i was but i said might there is the grand duke and the marquis you know yes no calling could be too humble were the man what i would wish him to be i work declared mr parkenstacker in a res taurant the girl shrank slightly not as a waiter she said a little imploringly labor is noble but personal attendance you know valets and i am not a waiter i am cashier in on the street they faced that bounded the opposite side of the park was the brilliant electric sign restau rant i am cashier in that restaurant you am there the girl consulted a tiny watch set in a bracelet of rich design upon her left wrist and rose hurriedly she thrust her book into a glittering reticule sus pended from her waist for which however the book was too large why are you not at work she asked i am on the night turn said the young man it is yet an hour before my period begins may i not hope to see you again i do not know perhaps but the whim may not seize me again i must go quickly now there is a dinner and a box at the play and oh the same old round perhaps you noticed an automobile at the upper corner of the park as you came one with a white body and red running gear asked the young man knitting his brows reflectively yes i always come in that pierre waits for me there he supposes me to be shopping in the de partment store across the square conceive of the bondage of the life wherein we must deceive even our chauffeurs good night but it is dark now said mr parkenstacker and the park is full of rude men may i not walk if you have the slightest regard for my wishes said the girl firmly you will remain at this bench for ten minutes after i have left i do not mean to accuse you but you are probably aware that autos generally bear the monogram of their owner again good night swift and stately she moved away through the dusk the young man watched her graceful form as she reached the pavement at the park s edge and turned up along it toward the corner where stood the automobile then he treacherously and unhesitat ingly began to dodge and skim among the park trees and shrubbery in a course parallel to her route keep ing her well in sight when she reached the corner she turned her head to glance at the motor car and then passed it con tinuing on across the street sheltered behind a con venient standing cab the young man followed her movements closely with his eyes passing down the sidewalk of the street opposite the park she entered the restaurant with the blazing sign the place was one of those frankly glaring establishments all white paint and glass where one may dine cheaply and conspicuously the girl penetrated the restaurant to some retreat at its rear whence she quickly emerged without her bat and veil the cashier s desk was well to the front a red head girl an the stool climbed down glancing pointedly at the clock as she did so the girl in gray mounted in her place the young man thrust his hands into his pockets and walked slowly back along the sidewalk at the corner his foot struck a small paper covered volume lying there sending it sliding to the edge of the turf by its picturesque cover he recognized it as the book the girl had been reading he picked it up carelessly and saw that its title was new arabian nights the author being of the name of stevenson he dropped it again upon the grass and lounged irresolute for a minute then he stepped into the automobile reclined upon the cushions and said two words to the chauffeur club henri a comedy in rubber one may hope in spite of the metaphorists to avoid the breath of the deadly upas tree one may by great good fortune succeed in blacking the eye of the basilisk one might even dodge the attentions of cer berus and argus but no man alive or dead can es cape the gaze of the rubberer new york is the caoutchouc city there are many of course who go their ways making money without turning to the right or the left but there is a tribe abroad wonderfully composed like the martians solely of eyes and means of locomotion these devotees of curiosity swarm like flies in a moment in a struggling breathless circle about the scene of an unusual occurrence if a workman opens a manhole if a street car runs over a man from north tarrytown if a little boy drops an egg on his way home from the grocery if a casual house or two drops into the subway if a lady loses a nickel through a hole in the lisle thread if the police drag a telephone and a racing chart forth from an ibsen society reading room if senator depew or mr chuck connors walks out to take the air if any of these incidents or accidents takes place you will see the mad irresistible rush of the rubber tribe to the spot the importance of the event does not count they gaze with equal interest and absorption at a cho rus girl or at a man painting a liver pill sign they will form as deep a cordon around a man with a club foot as they will around a balked automobile they have the furor rubberendi they are optical glut tons feasting and fattening on the misfortunes of their fellow beings they gloat and pore and glare and squint and stare with their fishy eyes like goggle eyed perch at the book baited with calamity it would seem that cupid would find these ocular vampires too cold game for his calorific shafts but have we not yet to discover an immune even among the protozoa yes beautiful romance descended upon two of this tribe and love came into their hearts as they crowded about the prostrate form of a man who had been run over by a brewery wagon william pry was the first on the spot he was an expert at such gatherings with an expression of in tense happiness on his features be stood over the vic tim of the accident listening to his groans as if to the sweetest music when the crowd of spectators had swelled to a closely packed circle william saw a violent commotion in the crowd opposite him men were hurled aside like ninepins by the impact of some moving body that clove them like the rush of a tor nado with elbows umbrella hat pin tongue and fingernails doing their duty violet seymour forced her way through the mob of onlookers to the first row strong men who even had been able to secure a seat on the harlem express staggered back like chil dren as she bucked centre two large lady spectators who bad seen the duke of roxburgh married and had often blocked traffic on twenty third street fell back into the second row with ripped shirtwaists when violet had finished with them william pry loved her at first sight the ambulance removed the unconscious agent of cupid william and violet remained after the crowd had dispersed they were true rubberers people who leave the scene of an accident with the ambulance have not genuine caoutchouc in the cosmogony of their necks the delicate fine flavor of the affair is to be bad only in the after taste in gloating over the spot in gazing fixedly at the houses opposite in hovering there in a dream more exquisite than the opium eater s ecstasy william pry and violet sey mour were connoisseurs in casualties they knew bow to extract full enjoyment from every incident presently they looked at each other violet had a brown birthmark on her neck as large as a silver half dollar william fixed his eyes upon it william pry had inordinately bowed legs violet allowed her gaze to linger unswervingly upon them face to face they stood thus for moments each staring at the other etiquette would not allow them to speak but in the caoutchouc city it is permitted to gaze with out stint at the trees in the parks and at the physi cal blemishes of a fellow creature at length with a sigh they parted but cupid had been the driver of the brewery wagon and the wheel that broke a leg united two fond hearts the next meeting of the hero and heroine was in front of a board fence near broadway the day had been a disappointing one there had been no fights on the street children had kept from under the wheels of the street cars cripples and fat men in negligee shirts were scarce nobody seemed to be inclined to slip on banana peels or fall down with heart disease even the sport from kokomo ind who claims to be a cousin of ex mayor low and scatters nickels from a cab window had not put in his appearance there was nothing to stare at and william pry had premonitions of ennui but he saw a large crowd scrambling and pushing excitedly in front of a billboard sprinting for it he knocked down an old woman and a child carrying a bottle of milk and fought his way like a demon into the mass of spectators already in the inner line stood violet seymour with one sleeve and two gold fill ings gone a corset steel puncture and a sprained wrist but happy she was looking at what there was to see a man was painting upon the fence eat bricklets they fill your face violet blushed when she saw william pry william jabbed a lady in a black silk raglan in the ribs kicked a boy in the shin bit an old gentleman on the left ear and managed to crowd nearer to violet they stood for an hour looking at the man paint the letters then william s love could be repressed no longer he touched her on the arm come with me he said i know where there is a bootblack without an adam s apple she looked up at him shyly yet with unmistakable love transfiguring her countenance and you have saved it for me she asked trembling with the first dim ecstasy of a woman be loved together they hurried to the bootblack s stand an hour they spent there gazing at the malformed youth a window cleaner fell from the fifth story to the sidewalk beside them as the ambulance came clang ing up william pressed her hand joyously four ribs at least and a compound fracture he whispered swiftly you are not sorry that you met me are you dearest me said violet returning the pressure sure not i could stand all day rubbering with you the climax of the romance occurred a few days later perhaps the reader will remember the intense excitement into which the city was thrown when eliza jane a colored woman was served with a subpoena the rubber tribe encamped on the spot with his own hands william pry placed a board upon two beer kegs in the street opposite eliza jane s residence he and violet sat there for three days and nights then it occurred to a detective to open the door and serve the subpoena he sent for a kinetoscope and did so two souls with such congenial tastes could not long remain apart as a policeman drove them away with his night stick that evening they plighted their troth the seeds of love bad been well sown and had grown up hardy and vigorous into a let us call it a rub ber plant the wedding of william pry and violet seymour was set for june the big church in the middle of the block was banked high with flowers the populous tribe of rubberers the world over is ram pant over weddings they are the pessimists of the pews they are the guyers of the groom and the banterers of the bride they come to laugh at your marriage and should you escape from hymen s tower on the back of death s pale steed they will come to the funeral and sit in the same pew and cry over your luck rubber will stretch the church was lighted a grosgrain carpet lay over the asphalt to the edge of the sidewalk brides maids were patting one another s sashes awry and speaking of the bride s freckles coachmen tied white ribbons on their whips and bewailed the space of time between drinks the minister was musing over his possible fee essaying conjecture whether it would suffice to purchase a new broadcloth suit for himself and a photograph of laura jane libbey for his wife yea cupid was in the air and outside the church oh my brothers surged and heaved the rank and file of the tribe of rubberers in two bodies they were with the grosgrain carpet and cops with clubs between they crowded like cattle they fought they pressed and surged and swayed and trampled one another to see a bit of a girl in a white veil acquire license to go through a man s pockets while be sleeps but the hour for the wedding came and went and the bride and bridegroom came not and impatience gave way to alarm and alarm brought about search and they were not found and then two big police men took a band and dragged out of the furious mob of onlookers a crushed and trampled thing with a wedding ring in its vest pocket and a shredded and hysterical woman beating her way to the carpet s edge ragged bruised and obstreperous william pry and violet seymour creatures of habit had joined in the seething game of the specta tors unable to resist the overwhelming desire to gaze upon themselves entering as bride and bridegroom the rose decked church rubber will out one thousand dollars one thousand dollars repeated lawyer tolman solemnly and severely and here is the money young gillian gave a decidedly amused laugh as he fingered the thin package of new fifty dollar notes it s such a confoundedly awkward amount he explained genially to the lawyer if it had been ten thousand a fellow might wind up with a lot of fireworks and do himself credit even fifty dollars would have been less trouble you heard the reading of your uncle s will con tinued lawyer tolman professionally dry in his tones i do not know if you paid much attention to its details i must remind you of one you are required to render to us an account of the manner of expenditure of this as soon as you have dis posed of it the will stipulates that i trust that you will so far comply with the late mr gillian s wishes you may depend upon it said the young man politely in spite of the extra expense it will entail i may have to engage a secretary i was never good at accounts gillian went to his club there be hunted out one whom he called old bryson old bryson was calm and forty and sequestered he was in a corner reading a book and when he saw gillian approaching he sighed laid down his book and took off his glasses old bryson wake up said gillian i ve a funny story to tell you i wish you would tell it to some one in the billiard room said old bryson you know how i hate your stories this is a better one than usual said gillian rolling a cigarette and i m glad to tell it to you it s too sad and funny to go with the rattling of billiard bars i ve just come from my late uncle s firm of legal corsairs he leaves me an even thou sand dollars now what can a man possibly do with a thousand dollars i thought said old bryson showing as much interest as a bee shows in a vinegar cruet that the late septimus gillian was worth something like half a million he was assented gillian joyously and that s where the joke comes in he s left his whole cargo of doubloons to a microbe that is part of it goes to the man who invents a new bacillus and the rest to es tablish a hospital for doing away with it again there are one or two trifling bequests on the side the butler and the housekeeper get a seal ring and each his nephew gets you ve always had plenty of money to spend observed old bryson tons said gillian uncle was the fairygod mother as far as an allowance was concerned any other heirs asked old bryson none gillian frowned at his cigarette and kicked the upholstered leather of a divan uneasily there is a miss hayden a ward of my uncle who lived in his house she s a quiet thing musical the daughter of somebody who was unlucky enough to be his friend i forgot to say that she was in on the seal ring and joke too i wish i had been then i could have had two bottles of brut tipped the waiter with the ring and had the whole business off my bands don t be superior and insulting old bry son tell me what a fellow can do with a thousand dollars old bryson rubbed his glasses and smiled and when old bryson smiled gillian knew that be in tended to be more offensive than ever a thousand dollars lie said means much or little one man may buy a happy home with it and laugh at rockefeller another could send his wife south with it and save her life a thousand dollars would buy pure milk for one hundred babies during june july and august and save fifty of their lives you could count upon a half hour s diversion with it at faro in one of the fortified art galleries it would furnish an education to an ambitious boy i am told that a genuine corot was secured for that

and then take yourself off to idaho and inflict your presence upon a ranch i advise a sheep ranch as i have a particular dislike for sheep thanks said gillian rising i thought i could depend upon you old bryson you ve hit on the very scheme i wanted to chuck the money in a lump for i ve got to turn in an account for it and i hate itemizing gillian phoned for a cab and said to the driver the stage entrance of the columbine theatre miss lotta lauriere was assisting nature with a powder puff almost ready for her call at a crowded matinee when her dresser mentioned the name of mr gillian let it in said miss lauriere now what is it bobby i m going on in two minutes rabbit foot your right ear a little suggested gillian critically that s better it won t take two minutes for me what do you say to a

stacey had on the other night twenty two hundred dollars it cost at tiffany s but of course pull my sash a little to the left adams miss lauriere for the opening chorus cried the call boy without gillian strolled out to where his cab was waiting what would you do with a thousand dollars if you had it be asked the driver open a s loon said the cabby promptly and huskily i know a place i could take money in with both hands it s a four story brick on a corner i ve got it figured out second story chinks and chop suey third floor manicures and foreign mis sions fourth floor poolroom if you was think of putting up the capital oh no said gillian i merely asked from cu riosity i take you by the hour drive til i tell you to stop eight blocks down broadway gillian poked up the trap with his cane and got out a blind man sat upon a stool on the sidewalk selling pencils gillian went out and stood before him excuse me he said but would you mind tell ing me what you would do if you bad a thousand dollars you got out of that cab that just drove up didn t you asked the blind man i did said gillian guess you are all right said the pencil dealer to ride in a cab by daylight take a look at that if you like he drew a small book from his coat pocket and held it out gillian opened it and saw that it was a bank deposit book it showed a balance of to the blind man s credit gillian returned the book and got into the cab i forgot something be said you may drive to the law offices of tolman sharp at broad way lawyer tolman looked at him hostilely and in quiringly through his gold rimmed glasses i beg your pardon said gillian cheerfully but may i ask you a question it is not an im pertinent one i hope was miss hayden left any thing by my uncle s will besides the ring and the nothing said mr tolman i thank you very much sir said gillian and on he went to his cab he gave the driver the ad dress of his late uncle s home miss hayden was writing letters in the library she was small and slender and clothed in black but you would have noticed her eyes gillian drifted in with his air of regarding the world as inconsequent i ve just come from old tolman s he explained they ve been going over the papers down there they found a gillian searched his memory for a legal term they found an amendment or a post script or something to the will it seemed that the old boy loosened up a little on second thoughts and willed you a thousand dollars i was driving up this way and tolman asked me to bring you the money here it is you d better count it to see if it s right gillian laid the money beside her hand on the desk miss hayden turned white oh she said and again oh gillian half turned and looked out the window i suppose of course be said in a low voice that you know i love you i am sorry said miss hayden taking up her money there is no use asked gillian almost light heartedly i am sorry she said again may i write a note asked gillian with a smile i re seated himself at the big library table she sup plied him with paper and pen and then went back to her secretaire gillian made out his account of his expenditure of the thousand dollars i i these words paid by the black sheep robert gillian on account of the eternal happiness owed by heaven to the best and dearest woman on earth gillian slipped his writing into an envelope bowed and went his way his cab stopped again at the offices of tolman sharp i have expended the thousand dollars he said cheerily to tolman of the gold glasses and i have come to render account of it as i agreed there is quite a feeling of summer in the air do you not think so mr tolman he tossed a white envelope on the lawyer s table you will find there a memo randum sir of the modus operandi of the vanishing of the dollars without touching the envelope mr tolman went to a door and called his partner sharp together they explored the caverns of an immense safe forth they dragged as trophy of their search a big envelope sealed with wax this they forcibly invaded and wagged their venerable heads together over its con tents then tolman became spokesman mr gillian he said formally there was a codicil to your uncle s will it was intrusted to us privately with instructions that it be not opened until you had furnished us with a full account of your handling of the bequest in the will as you have fulfilled the conditions my partner and i have read the codicil i do not wish to encumber your understanding with its legal phraseology but i will acquaint you with the spirit of its contents in the event that your disposition of the demonstrates that you possess any of the qualifica tions that deserve reward much benefit will accrue to you mr sharp and i are named as the judges and i assure you that we will do our duty strictly according to justice with liberality we are not at all unfavorably disposed toward you mr gillian but let us return to the letter of the codicil if your disposal of the money in question has been prudent wise or unselflish it is in our power to hand you over bonds to the value of which have been placed in our hands for that purpose but if as our client the late mr gillian explicitly provides you have used this money as you have money in the past i quote the late mr gillian in reprehensible dissipation among disreputable associates the is to be paid to miriam hayden ward of the late mr gillian without delay now mr gillian mr sharp and i will examine your account in regard to the you submit it in writing i believe i hope you will repose confidence in our decision mr tolman reached for the envelope gillian was a little the quicker in taking it up he tore the account and its cover leisurely into strips and dropped them into his pocket it s all right he said smilingly there isn t a bit of need to bother you with this i don t suppose you d understand these itemized bets anyway i lost the thousand dollars on the races good day to you gentlemen tolman sharp shook their beads mournfully at each other when gillian left for they heard him whis tling gayly in the hallway as he waited for the elevator the defeat of the city robert walmsley s descent upon the city resulted in a kilkenny struggle he came out of the fight victor by a fortune and a reputation on the other band he was swallowed up by the city the city gave him what he demanded and then branded him with its brand it remodelled cut trimmed and stamped him to the pattern it approves it opened its social gates to him and shut him in on a close cropped formal lawn with the select herd of rumi nants in dress habits manners provincialism routine and narrowness he acquired that charming in solence that irritating completeness that sophisti cated crassness that overbalanced poise that makes the manhattan gentleman so delightfully small in his greatness one of the up state rural counties pointed with pride to the successful young metropolitan lawyer as a product of its soil six years earlier this county had removed the wheat straw from between its huckle berry stained teeth and emitted a derisive and bucolic laugh as old man walmsley s freckle faced bob abandoned the certain three per diem meals of the one horse farm for the discontinuous quick lunch counters of the three ringed metropolis at the end of the six years no murder trial coaching party au tomobile accident or cotillion was complete in which the name of robert walmsley did not figure tailors waylaid him in the street to get a new wrinkle from the cut of his unwrinkled trousers hyphenated fel lows in the clubs and members of the oldest subpoenaed families were glad to clap him on the back and allow him three letters of his name but the matterhorn of robert walmsley s success was not scaled until be married alicia van der pool i cite the matterhorn for just so high and cool and white and inaccessible was this daughter of the old burghers the social alps that ranged about her over whose bleak passes a thousand climbers struggled reached only to her knees she towered in her own atmosphere serene chaste prideful wading in no fountains dining no monkeys breeding no dogs for bench shows she was a van der pool fountains were made to play for her monkeys were made for other people s ancestors dogs she understood were created to be companions of blind persons and objec tionable characters who smoked pipes this was the matterhorn that robert walmsley accomplished if he found with the good poet with the game foot and artificially curled hair that he who ascends to mountain tops will find the loftiest peaks most wrapped in clouds and snow he concealed his chilblains beneath a brave and smiling exterior he was a lucky man and knew it even though he were imitating the spartan boy with an ice cream freezer beneath his doublet frappeeing the region of his heart after a brief wedding tour abroad the couple re turned to create a decided ripple in the calm cistern so placid and cool and sunless it is of the best so ciety they entertained at their red brick mausoleum of ancient greatness in an old square that is a ceme tery of crumbled glory and robert walmsley was proud of his wife although while one of his hands shook his guests the other held tightly to his alpen stock and thermometer one day alicia found a letter written to robert by his mother it was an unerudite letter full of crops and motherly love and farm notes it chronicled the health of the pig and the recent red calf and asked concerning robert s in return it was a letter direct from the soil straight from home full of biographies of bees tales of turnips peaans of new laid eggs neg lected parents and the slump in dried apples why have i not been shown your mother s let ters asked alicia there was always something in her voice that made you think of lorgnettes of ac counts at tiffany s of sledges smoothly gliding on the trail from dawson to forty mile of the tinkling of pendant prisms on your grandmothers chandeliers of snow lying on a convent roof of a police sergeant refusing bail your mother continued alicia invites us to make a visit to the farm i have never seen a farm we will go there for a week or two robert we will said robert with the grand air of an associate supreme justice concurring in an opinion i did not lay the invitation before you because i thought you would not care to go i am much pleased at your decision i will write to her myself answered alicia with a faint foreshadowing of enthusiasm felice shall pack my trunks at once seven i think will be enough i do not suppose that your mother entertains a great deal does she give many house parties robert arose and as attorney for rural places filed a demurrer against six of the seven trunks he en deavored to define picture elucidate set forth and describe a farm his own words sounded strange in his ears he had not realized how thoroughly urbsi dized he had become a week passed and found them landed at the little country station five hours out from the city a grin ning stentorian sarcastic youth driving a mule to a spring wagon hailed robert savagely hallo mr walmsley found your way back at last have you sorry i couldn t bring in the auto mobile for you but dad s bull tonguing the ten acre clover patch with it to day guess you ll excuse my not wearing a dress suit over to meet you it ain t six o clock yet you know i m glad to see you tom said robert grasp ing his brother s band yes i ve found my way at last you ve a right to say at last it s been over two years since the last time but it will be oftener after this my boy alicia cool in the summer beat as an arctic wraith white as a norse snow maiden in her flimsy muslin and fluttering lace parasol came round the corner of the station and tom was stripped of his assurance he became chiefly eyesight clothed in blue jeans and on the homeward drive to the mule alone did he confide in language the inwardness of his thoughts they drove homeward the low sun dropped a spendthrift flood of gold upon the fortunate fields of wheat the cities were far away the road lay curl ing around wood and dale and bill like a ribbon lost from the robe of careless summer the wind followed like a whinnying colt in the track of phoebus s steeds by and by the farmhouse peeped gray out of its faithful grove they saw the long lane with its convoy of walnut trees running from the road to the house they smelled the wild rose and the breath of cool damp willows in the creek s bed and then in unison all the voices of the soil began a chant addressed to the soul of robert walmsley out of the tilted aisles of the dim wood they came hollowly they chirped and buzzed from the parched grass they trilled from the ripples of the creek ford they floated up in clear pan s pipe notes from the dimming meadows the whippoorwills joined in as they pursued midges in the upper air slow going cow bells struck out a homely accompaniment and this was what each one said you ve found your way back at last have you the old voices of the soil spoke to him leaf and bud and blossom conversed with him in the old vocabu lary of his careless youth the inanimate things the familiar stones and rails the gates and furrows and roofs and turns of the road had an eloquence too and a power in the transformation the country had smiled and he had felt the breath of it and his heart was drawn as if in a moment back to his old love the city was far away this rural atavism then seized robert walmsley and possessed him a queer thing he noticed in con nection with it was that alicia sitting at his side suddenly seemed to him a stranger she did not be long to this recurrent phase never before had she seemed so remote so colorless and high so intan gible and unreal and yet he had never admired her more than when she sat there by him in the rickety spring wagon chiming no more with his mood and with her environment than the matterhorn chimes with a peasant s cabbage garden that night when the greetings and the supper were over the entire family including buff the yellow dog bestrewed itself upon the front porch alicia not haughty but silent sat in the shadow dressed in an exquisite pale gray tea gown robert s mother dis coursed to her happily concerning marmalade and lumbago tom sat on the top step sisters millie and pam on the lowest step to catch the lightning bugs mother had the willow rocker father sat in the big armchair with one of its arms gone buff sprawled in the middle of the porch in everybody s way the twilight pixies and pucks stole forth un seen and plunged other poignant shafts of memory into the heart of robert a rural madness entered his soul the city was far away father sat without his pipe writhing in his heavy boots a sacrifice to rigid courtesy robert shouted no you don t he fetched the pipe and lit it he seized the old gentleman s boots and tore them off the last one slipped suddenly and mr robert walmsley of washington square tumbled off the porch backward with buff on top of him bowling fearfully tom laughed sarcastically robert tore off his coat and vest and hurled them into a lilac bush come out here you landlubber be cried to tom and i ll put grass seed on your back i think you called me a dude a while ago come along and cut your capers tom understood the invitation and accepted it with delight three times they wrestled on the grass side holds even as the giants of the mat and twice was tom forced to bite grass at the hands of the distinguished lawyer dishevelled panting each still boasting of his own prowess they stumbled back to the porch millie cast a pert reflection upon the qualities of a city brother in an instant robert had secured a horrid katydid in his fingers and bore down upon her screaming wildly she fled up the lane pursued by the avenging glass of form a quarter of a mile and they returned she full of apology to the victorious dude the rustic mania possessed him unabatedly i can do up a cowpenful of you slow hayseeds he proclaimed vaingloriously bring on your bull dogs your hired men and your log rollers he turned handsprings on the grass that prodded tom to envious sarcasm and then with a whoop he clattered to the rear and brought back uncle like a battered colored retainer of the family with his banjo and strewed sand on the porch and danced chicken in the bread tray and did buck and wing wonders for half an hour longer incredibly wild and boisterous things he did he sang he told stories that set all but one shrieking he played the yokel the humorous clodhopper he was mad and with the revival of the old life in his blood he became so extravagant that once his mother sought gently to reprove him then alicia moved as though she were about to speak but she did not through it all she sat immovable a slim white spirit in the dusk that no man might question or read by and by she asked permission to ascend to her room saying that she was tired on her way she passed robert he was standing in the door the figure of vulgar comedy with ruffled hair reddened face and unpardonable confusion of attire no trace there of the immaculate robert walmsley the courted clubman and ornament of select circles he was do ing a conjuring trick with some household utensils and the family now won over to him without excep tion was beholding him with worshipful admiration as alicia passed in robert started suddenly he had forgotten for the moment that she was present without a glance at him she went on upstairs after that the fun grew quiet an hour passed in talk and then robert went up himself she was standing by the window when he entered their room she was still clothed as when they were on the porch outside and crowding against the window was a giant apple tree full blossomed robert sighed and went near the window he was ready to meet his fate a confessed vulgarian he foresaw the verdict of justice in the shape of that whiteclad form he knew the rigid lines that a van der pool would draw he was a peasant gam bolling indecorously in the valley and the pure cold white unthawed summit of the matterhorn could not but frown on him he had been unmasked by his own actions all the polish the poise the form that the city had given him had fallen from him like an ill fitting mantle at the first breath of a country breeze dully be awaited the approaching condemna tion robert said the calm cool voice of his judge i thought i married a gentleman yes it was coming and yet in the face of it robert walmsley was eagerly regarding a certain branch of the apple tree upon which be used to climb out of that very window he believed he could do it now he wondered bow many blossoms there were on the tree ten millions but here was some one speaking again i thought i married a gentleman the voice went on but why had she come and was standing so close by his side but i find that i have married was this alicia talking something better a man bob dear kiss me won t you the city was far away the shocks of doom here is an aristocracy of the public parks and even of the vagabonds who use them for their private apartments vallance felt rather than knew this but when he stepped down out of his world into chaos his feet brought him directly to madison square raw and astringent as a schoolgirl of the old order young may breathed austerely among the budding trees vallance buttoned his coat lighted his last cigarette and took his seat upon a bench for three minutes be mildly regretted the last hundred of his last thousand that it had cost him when the bicycle cop put an end to his last automobile ride then he felt in every pocket and found not a single penny he had given up his apartment that morning his furniture had gone toward certain debts his clothes save what were upon him had descended to his man servant for back wages as he sat there was not in the whole city for him a bed or a broiled lobster or a street car fare or a carnation for buttonhole unless be should obtain them by spong on his friends or by false pretenses therefore lie had chosen the park and all this was because an uncle had disinherited him and cut down his allowance from liberality to nothing and all that was because his nephew had disobeyed him concerning a certain girl who comes not into this story therefore all readers who brush their hair toward its roots may be warned to read no further there was another nephew of a different branch who had once been the prospective heir and favorite being without grace or hope he had long ago disappeared in the mire now drag nets were out for him he was to be rehabilitated and restored and so vallance fell grandly as lucifer to the lowest pit joining the tattered ghosts in the little park sitting there he leaned far back on the hard bench and laughed a jet of cigarette smoke up to the lowest tree branches the sudden severing of all his life s ties had brought him a free thrilling almost joyous elation he felt precisely the sensation of the aero naut when he cuts loose his parachute and lets his balloon drift away the hour was nearly ten not many loungers were on the benches the park dweller though a stubborn fighter against autumnal coolness is slow to attack the advance line of spring s chilly cohorts then arose one from a seat near the leaping foun tain and came and sat himself at vallance s side he was either young or old cheap lodging houses had flavored him mustily razors and combs had passed him by in him drink had been bottled and sealed in the devil s bond he begged a match which is the form of introduction among park benchers and then he began to talk you re not one of the regulars he said to val lance i know tailored clothes when i see em you just stopped for a moment on your way through the park don t mind my talking to you for a while i ve got to be with somebody i m afraid i m afraid i ve told two or three of those bummers over about it they think i m crazy say let tell you all i ve had to eat to day was a couple pretzels and an apple to morrow i ll stand in to inherit three millions and that restaurant you ee over there with the autos around it will be too for me to eat in don t believe it do you without the slightest trouble said vallance with a laugh i lunched there yesterday to night i couldn t buy a five cent cup of coffee you don t look like one of us well i guess those things happen i used to be a high flyer myself years ago what knocked you out of the game i oh i lost my job said vallance it s undiluted hades this city went on the other one day you re eating from china the next you are eating in china a chop suey joint i ve had more than my share of hard luck for five years i ve been little better than a panhandler i was raised up to live expensively and do nothing say i don t mind telling you i ve got to talk to somebody you see because i m afraid i m afraid my name s ide you wouldn t think that old paulding one of the millionaires on riverside drive was my uncle would you well he is i lived in his house once and had all the money i wanted say haven t you got the price of a couple of drinks about you er what s your name dawson said vallance no i m sorry to say that i m all in financially i ve been living for a week in a coal cellar on division street went on ide with a crook they called blinky morris i didn t have anywhere else to go while i was out to day a chap with some pa pers in his pocket was there asking for me i didn t know but what he was a fly cop so i didn t go around again till after dark there was a letter there be had left for me say dawson it was from a big downtown lawyer mead i ve seen his sign on ann street paulding wants me to play the prodigal nephew wants me to come back and be his heir again and blow in his money i m to call at the lawyer s office at ten to morrow and step into my old shoes again heir to three million dawson and a year pocket money and i m afraid i m afraid the vagrant leaped to his feet and raised both trembling arms above his bead he caught his breath and moaned hysterically vallance seized his arm and forced him back to the bench be quiet he commanded with something like disgust in his tones one would think you had lost a fortune instead of being about to acquire one of what are you afraid ide cowered and shivered on the bench he clung to vallance s sleeve and even in the dim glow of the broadway lights the latest disinherited one could see drops on the other s brow wrung out by some strange terror why i m afraid something will happen to me be fore morning i don t know what something to keep me from coming into that money i m afraid a tree will fall on me i m afraid a cab will run over me or a stone drop on me from a housetop or some thing i never was afraid before i ve sat in this park a hundred nights as calm as a graven image without knowing where my breakfast was to come from but now it s different i love money daw son i m happy as a god when it s trickling through my fingers and people are bowing to me with the music and the flowers and fine clothes all around as long as i knew i was out of the game i didn t mind i was even happy sitting here ragged and hungry listening to the fountain jump and watching the carriages go up the avenue but it s in reach of my hand again now almost and i can t stand it to wait twelve hours dawson i can t stand it there are fifty things that could happen to me i could go blind i might be attacked with heart disease the world might come to an end before i could ide sprang to his feet again with a shriek peo ple stirred on the benches and began to look val lance took his arm come and walk he said soothingly and try to calm yourself there is no need to become ex cited or alarmed nothing is going to happen to you one night is like another that s right said ide stay with me daw son that s a good fellow walk around with me awhile i never went to pieces like this before and i ve had a good many hard knocks do you think you could hustle something in the way of a little lunch old man i m afraid my nerve s too far gone to try any panhandling vallance led his companion up almost deserted fifth avenue and then westward along the thirties toward broadway wait here a few minutes he said leaving ide in a quiet and shadowed spot he entered a familiar hotel and strolled toward the bar quite in his old assured way there s a poor devil outside jimmy he said to the bartender who says he s hungry and looks it you know what they do when you give them money fix up a sandwich or two for him and i ll see that he doesn t throw it away certainly mr vallance said the bartender they ain t all fakes don t like to see anybody go hungry ide folded a liberal supply of the free lunch into a napkin vallance went with it and joined his com panion ide pounced upon the food ravenously i haven t had any free lunch as good as this in a year be said aren t you going to eat any dawson i m not hungry thanks said vallance we ll go back to the square said ide the cops won t bother us there i ll roll up the rest of this ham and stuff for our breakfast i won t eat any more i m afraid i ll get sick suppose i d die of cramps or something to night and never get to touch that money again it s eleven hours yet till time to see that lawyer you won t leave me will you dawson i m afraid something might happen you haven t any place to go have you no said vallance nowhere to night i ll have a bench with you you take it cool said ide if you ve told it to me straight i should think a man put on the bum from a good job just in one day would be tearing his hair i believe i ve already remarked said vallance laughing that i would have thought that a man who was expecting to come into a fortune on the next day would be feeling pretty easy and quiet it s funny business philosophized ide about the way people take things anyhow here s your bench dawson right next to mine the light don t shine in your eyes here say dawson i ll get the old man to give you a letter to somebody about a job when i get back home you ve helped me a lot to night i don t believe i could have gone through the night if i hadn t struck you thank you said vallance do you lie down or sit up on these when you sleep for hours vallance gazed almost without winking at the stars through the branches of the trees and listened to the sharp slapping of horses hoofs on the sea of asphalt to the south his mind was active but his feelings were dormant every emotion seemed to have been eradicated ide felt no regrets no fears no pain or discomfort even when be thought of the girl it was as of an inhabitant of one of those remote stars at which be gazed he re membered the absurd antics of his companion and laughed softly yet without a feeling of mirth soon the daily army of milk wagons made of the city a roaring drum to which they marched vallance fell asleep on his comfortless bench at ten o clock on the next day the two stood at the door of lawyer mead s office in ann street ide s nerves fluttered worse than ever when the hour approached and vallance could not decide to leave him a possible prey to the dangers he dreaded when they entered the office lawyer mead looked at them wonderingly he and vallance were old friends after his greeting he turned to ide who stood with white face and trembling limbs before the expected crisis i sent a second letter to your address last night mr ide he said i learned this morning that you were not there to receive it it will inform you that mr paulding has reconsidered his offer to take you back into favor he has decided not to do so and desires you to understand that no change will be made in the relations existing between you and him ide s trembling suddenly ceased the color came back to his face and be straightened his back his jaw went forward half an inch and a gleam came into his eye he pushed back his battered bat with one hand and extended the other with levelled fin gers toward the lawyer he took a long breath and then laughed sardonically tell old paulding he may go to the devil he said loudly and clearly and turned and walked out of the office with a firm and lively step lawyer mead turned on his heel to vallance and smiled i am glad you came in he said genially your uncle wants you to return home at once he is reconciled to the situation that led to his hasty action and desires to say that all will be as hey adams cried lawyer mead breaking his sentence and calling to his clerk bring a glass of water mr vallance has fainted the plutonian fire there are a few editor men with whom i am privi leged to come in contact it has not been long since it was their habit to come in contact with me there is a difference they tell me that with a large number of the manuscripts that are submitted to them come advices in the way of a boost from the author asseverating that the incidents in the story are true the des tination of such contributions depends wholly upon the question of the enclosure of stamps some are returned the rest are thrown on the floor in a corner on top of a pair of gum shoes an overturned statu ette of the winged victory and a pile of old maga zines containing a picture of the editor in the act of reading the latest copy of le petit journal right side up you can tell by the illustrations it is only a legend that there are waste baskets in editors offices thus is truth held in disrepute but in time truth and science and nature will adapt themselves to art things will happen logically and the villain be dis comfited instead of being elected to the board of directors but in the meantime fiction must not only be divorced from fact but must pay alimony and be awarded custody of the press despatches this preamble is to warn you off the grade cross ing of a true story being that it shall be told sim ply with conjunctions substituted for adjectives wherever possible and whatever evidences of style may appear in it shall be due to the linotype man it is a story of the literary life in a great city and it should be of interest to every author within a mile radius of gosport ind whose desk holds a ms story beginning thus while the cheers following his nomination were still ringing through the old courthouse harwood broke away from the congrat ulating handclasps of his henchmen and hurried to judge creswell s house to find ida pettit came up out of alabama to write fiction the southern papers had printed eight of his stories under an editorial caption identifying the author as the son of the gallant major pettingill pettit our former county attorney and hero of the battle of lookout mountain pettit was a rugged fellow with a kind of shame faced culture and my good friend his father kept a general store in a little town called hosea pettit had been raised in the pine woods and broom sedge fields adjacent thereto he had in his gripsack two manuscript novels of the adventures in picardy of one gaston laboulaye vicompte de montrepos in the year that s nothing we all do that and some day when we make a hit with the little sketch about a newsy and his lame dog the editor prints the other one for us or on us as the say ing is and then and then we have to get a big valise and peddle those patent air draft gas burners at everybody should have em i took pettit to the red brick house which was to appear in an article entitled literary landmarks of old new york some day when we got through with it he engaged a room there drawing on the general store for his expenses i showed new york to him and he did not mention how much narrower broadway is than lee avenue in hosea this seemed a good sign so i put the final test suppose you try your band at a descriptive arti cle i suggested giving your impressions of new york as seen from the brooklyn bridge the fresh point of view the don t be a fool said pettit let s go have some beer on the whole i rather like the city we discovered and enjoyed the only true bohemia every day and night we repaired to one of those palaces of marble and glass and tilework where goes on a tremendous and sounding epic of life valhalla itself could not be more glorious and sonorous the classic marble on which we ate the great light flooded vitreous front adorned with snow white scrolls the grand wagnerian din of clanking cups and bowls the flashing staccato of brandishing cut lery the piercing recitative of the white aproned grub maidens at the morgue like banquet tables the recurrent lied motif of the cash register it was a gigantic triumphant welding of art and sound a deafening soul uplifting pageant of heroic and em blematic life and the beans were only ten cents we wondered why our fellow artists cared to dine at sad little tables in their so called bohemian restau rants and we shuddered lest they should seek out our resorts and make them conspicuous with their pres ence pettit wrote many stories which the editors re turned to him he wrote love stories a thing i have always kept free from holding the belief that the well known and popular sentiment is not properly a matter for publication but something to be privately handled by the alienists and florists but the editors had told him that they wanted love stories because they said the women read them now the editors are wrong about that of course women do not read the love stories in the magazines they read the poker game stories and the recipes for cucumber lotion the love stories are read by fat cigar drummers and little ten year old girls i am not criticising the judgment of editors they are mostly very fine men but a man can be but one man with individual opinions and tastes i knew two associate editors of a magazine who were won derfully alike in almost everything and yet one of them was very fond of flaubert while the other preferred gin pettit brought me his returned manuscripts and we looked them over together to find out why they were not accepted they seemed to me pretty fair stories written in a good style and ended as they should at the bottom of the last page they were well constructed and the events were marshalled in orderly and logical sequence but i thought i detected a lack of living substance it was much as if i gazed at a symmetrical array of presentable clamshells from which the succulent and vital inhabitants had been removed i intimated that the author might do well to get better acquainted with his theme you sold a story last week said pettit about a gun fight in an arizona mining town in which the hero drew his colt s and shot seven bandits as fast as they came in the door now if a six shooter could oh well said i that s different arizona is a long way from new york i could have a man stabbed with a lariat or chased by a pair of chap arreras if i wanted to and it wouldn t be noticed until the usual error sharp from around mcadams junction isolates the erratum and writes in to the pa pers about it but you are up against another proposition this thing they call love is as common around new york as it is in sheboygan during the young onion season it may be mixed here with a little commercialism they read byron but they look up bradstreet s too while they re among the b s and brigham also if they have time but it s pretty much the same old internal disturbance every where you can fool an editor with a fake picture of a cowboy mounting a pony with his left hand on the saddle horn but you can t put him up a tree with a love story so you ve got to fall in love and then write the real thing pettit did i never knew whether he was taking my advice or whether be fell an accidental victim there was a girl be had met at one of these studio contrivances a glorious impudent lucid open minded girl with hair the color of culmbacher and a good natured way of despising you she was a new york girl well as the narrative style permits us to say in frequently pettit went to pieces all those pains those lover s doubts those heart burnings and tremors of which be had written so unconvincingly were his talk about shylock s pound of flesh twenty five pounds cupid got from pettit which is the usurer one night pettit came to my room exalted pale and haggard but exalted she had given him a jonquil old hoss said he with a new smile flickering around his mouth i believe i could write that story to night the one you know that is to win out i can feel it i don t know whether it will come out or not but i can feel it i pushed him out of my door go to your room and write it i ordered else i can see your fin ish i told you this must come first write it to night and put it under my door when it is done put it under my door to night when it is finished don t keep it until to morrow i was reading my bully old pal montaigne at two o clock when i beard the sheets rustle under my door i gathered them up and read the story the hissing of geese the languishing cooing of doves the braying of donkeys the chatter of irre sponsible sparrows these were in my mind s ear as i read suffering sappho i exclaimed to myself is this the divine fire that is supposed to ignite genius and make it practicable and wage earning the story was sentimental drivel full of whim pering softheartedness and gushing egoism all the art that pettit had acquired was gone a pe rusal of its buttery phrases would have made a cynic of a sighing chambermaid in the morning pettit came to my room i read him his doom mercilessly he laughed idiotically all right old hoss he said cheerily make cigar lighters of it what s the difference i m going to take her to lunch at claremont to day there was about a month of it and then pettit came to me bearing an invisible mitten with the forti tude of a dish rag he talked of the grave and south america and prussic acid and i lost an after noon getting him straight i took him out and saw that large and curative doses of whiskey were ad ministered to him i warned you this was a true story ware your white ribbons if only follow this tale for two weeks i fed him whiskey and omar and read to him regularly every evening the column in the evening paper that reveals the secrets of fe male beauty i recommend the treatment after pettit was cured be wrote more stories he recovered his old time facility and did work just short of good enough then the curtain rose on the third act a little dark eyed silent girl from new hamp shire who was studying applied design fell deeply in love with him she was the intense sort but ex ternally glace such as new england sometimes fools us with pettit liked her mildly and took her about a good deal she worshipped him and now and then ignored him there came a climax when she tried to jump out of a window and he had to save her by some perfunc tary unmeant wooing even i was shaken by the depths of the absorbing affection she showed home friends traditions creeds went up like thistle down in the scale against her love it was really discom posing one night again pettit sauntered in yawning as he had told me before he said he felt that he could do a great story and as before i hunted him to his room and saw him open his inkstand at one o clock the sheets of paper slid under my door i read that story and i jumped up late as it was with a whoop of joy old pettit had done it just as though it lay there red and bleeding a woman s heart was written into the lines you couldn t see the joining but art exquisite art and pulsing na ture had been combined into a love story that took you by the throat like the quinsy i broke into pettit s room and beat him on the back and called him name names high up in the galaxy of the im mortals that we admired and pettit yawned and begged to be allowed to sleep on the morrow i dragged him to an editor the great man read and rising gave pettit his hand that was a decoration a wreath of bay and a guar antee of rent and then old pettit smiled slowly i call him gen tleman pettit now to myself it s a miserable name to give a man but it sounds better than it looks in print i see said old pettit as he took up his story and began tearing it into small strips i see the game now you can t write with ink and you can t write with your own heart s blood but you can write with the heart s blood of some one else you have to be a cad before you can be an artist well i am for old alabam and the major s store have you got a light old hoss i went with pettit to the depot and died hard shakespeare s sonnets i blurted making a last stand how about him a cad said pettit they give it to you and you sell it love you know i d rather sell ploughs for father but i protested you are reversing the de cision of the world s greatest good by old hoss said pettit critics i continued but say if the major can use a fairly good salesman and book keeper down there in the store let me know will you nemesis and the candy man we sail at eight in the morning on the celtic said honoria plucking a loose thread from her lace sleeve i heard so said young ives dropping his hat and muffing it as he tried to catch it and i came around to wish you a pleasant voyage of course you heard it said honoria coldly sweet since we have had no opportunity of inform ing you ourselves ives looked at her pleadingly but with little hope outside in the street a high pitched voice chanted not unmusically a commercial gamut of cand de ee ee s nice fresh cand ee ee ee ees d it s our old candy man said honoria leaning out the window and beckoning i want some of his motto kisses there s nothing in the broadway shops half so good the candy man stopped his pushcart in front of the old madison avenue home he had a holiday and festival air unusual to street peddlers his tie was new and bright red and a horseshoe pin almost life size glittered speciously from its folds his brown thin face was crinkled into a semi foolish smile striped cuffs with dog head buttons covered the tan on his wrists i do believe he s going to get married said honoria pityingly i never saw him taken that way before and to day is the first time in months that he has cried his wares i am sure ives threw a coin to the sidewalk the candy man knows his customers he filled a paper bag climbed the old fashioned stoop and banded it in i remember said ives wait said honoria she took a small portfolio from the drawer of a writing desk and from the portfolio a slip of flimsy paper one quarter of an inch by two inches in size this said honoria inflexibly was wrapped about the first one we opened it was a year ago apologized ives as he held out his hand for it as long as skies above are blue to you my love i will be true this he read from the slip of flimsy paper we were to have sailed a fortnight ago said honoria gossipingly it has been such a warm summer the town is quite deserted there is no where to go yet i am told that one or two of the roof gardens are amusing the singing and the dancing on one or two seem to have met with ap proval ives did not wince when you are in the ring you are not surprised when your adversary taps you on the ribs i followed the candy man that time said ives irrelevantly and gave him five dollars at the corner of broadway he reached for the paper bag in honoria s lap took out one of the square wrapped confections and slowly unrolled it sara chillingworth s father said honoria has given her an automobile read that said ives handing over the slip that had been wrapped around the square of candy life teaches us how to live love teaches us to forgive honoria s checks turned pink honoria cried ives starting up from his chair miss clinton corrected honoria rising like venus from the head on the surf i warned you not to speak that name again honoria repeated ives you must bear me i know i do not deserve your forgiveness but i must have it there is a madness that possesses one some times for which his better nature is not responsible i throw everything else but you to the winds i strike off the chains that have bound me i re nounce the siren that lured me from you let the bought verse of that street peddler plead for me it is you only whom i can love let your love forgive and i swear to you that mine will be true as long as skies above are blue on the west side between sixth and seventh ave nues an alley cuts the block in the middle it per ishes in a little court in the centre of the block the district is theatrical the inhabitants the bubbling froth of half a dozen nations the atmosphere is bohemian the language polyglot the locality pre carious in the court at the rear of the alley lived the candy man at seven o clock be pushed his cart into the narrow entrance rested it upon the irregular stone slats and sat upon one of the handles to cool himself there was a great draught of cool wind through the alley there was a window above the spot where be al ways stopped his pushcart in the cool of the after noon mlle adele drawing card of the aerial roof garden sat at the window and took the air gen erally her ponderous mass of dark auburn hair was down that the breeze might have the felicity of aid ing sidonie the maid in drying and airing it about her shoulders the point of her that the pho tographers always made the most of was loosely draped a heliotrope scarf her arms to the elbow were bare there were no sculptors there to rave over them but even the stolid bricks in the walls of the alley should not have been so insensate as to disapprove while she sat thus fe ice another maid anointed and bathed the small feet that twinkled and so charmed the nightly aerial audiences gradually mademoiselle began to notice the candy man stopping to mop his brow and cool himself be neath her window in the hands of her maids she was deprived for the time of her vocation the charming and binding to her chariot of man to lose time was displeasing to mademoiselle here was the candy man no fit game for her darts truly but of the sex upon which she had been born to make war after casting upon him looks of unseeing coldness for a dozen times one afternoon she suddenly thawed and poured down upon him a smile that put to shame the sweets upon his cart candy man she said cooingly while sidonie followed her impulsive dive brushing the heavy auburn hair don t you think i am beautiful the candy man laughed harshly and looked up with his thin jaw set while he wiped his forehead with a red and blue handkerchief yer d make a dandy magazine cover he said grudgingly beautiful or not is for them that cares it s not my line if yer lookin for bou quets apply elsewhere between nine and twelve i think we ll have rain truly fascinating a candy man is like killing rab bits in a deep snow but the hunter s blood is widely diffused mademoiselle tugged a great coil of hair from sidonie s bands and let it fall out the window candy man have you a sweetheart anywhere with hair as long and soft as that and with an arm so round she flexed an arm like galatea s after the miracle across the window sill the candy man cackled shrilly as he arranged a stock of butter scotch that had tumbled down smoke up said he vulgarly nothin doin in the complimentary line i m too wise to be bam boozled by a switch of hair and a newly massaged arm oh i guess you ll make good in the calcium all right with plenty of powder and paint on and the orchestra playing under the old apple tree but don t put on your hat and chase downstairs to fly to the little church around the corner with me i ve been up against peroxide and make up boxes be fore say all joking aside don t you think we ll have rain candy man said mademoiselle softly with her lips curving and her chin dimpling don t you think i m

his pipe well said be i must be goin in there is a story in the evenin paper that i am readin men are divin in the seas for a treasure and pirates are watchin them from behind a reef and there ain t a woman on land or water or in the air good evenin and he trundled his pushcart down the alley and back to the musty court where he lived incredibly to him who has not learned woman mademoiselle sat at the window each day and spread her nets for the ignominious game once she kept a grand cavalier waiting in her reception chamber for half an hour while she battered in vain the candy man s tough philosophy his rough laugh chafed her vanity to its core daily he sat on his cart in the breeze of the alley while her hair was being ministered to and daily the shafts of her beauty rebounded from his dull bosom pointless and ineffectual un worthy pique brightened her eyes pride hurt she glowed upon him in a way that would have sent her higher adorers into an egoistic paradise the candy man s hard eyes looked upon her with a half con cealed derision that urged her to the use of the sharp est arrow in her beauty s quiver one afternoon she leaned far over the sill and she did not challenge and torment him as usual candy man said she stand up and look into my eyes he stood up and looked into her eyes with his harsh laugh like the sawing of wood he took out his pipe fumbled with it and put it back into big pocket with a trembling band that will do said mademoiselle with a slow smile i must go now to my masseuse good evening the next evening at seven the candy man came and rested his cart under the window but was it the candy man his clothes were a bright new check his necktie was a flaming red adorned by a glit tering horseshoe pin almost life size his shoes were polished the tan of his cheeks had paled his hands had been washed the window was empty and he waited under it with his nose upward like a hound hoping for a bone mademoiselle came with sidonie carrying her load of hair she looked at the candy man and smiled a slow smile that faded away into ennui instantly she knew that the game was bagged and so quickly she wearied of the chase she began to talk to sidonie been a fine day said the candy man hollowly first time in a month i ve felt first class hit it up down old madison hollering out like i useter think it ll rain to morrow mademoiselle laid two round arms on the cushion on the window sill and a dimpled chin upon them candy man said she softly do you not love me the candy man stood up and leaned against the brick wall lady said be chokingly i ve got saved up did i say you wasn t beautiful take it every bit of it and buy a collar for your dog with it a sound as of a hundred silvery bells tinkled in the room of mademoiselle the laughter filled the alley and trickled back into the court as strange a thing to enter there as sunlight itself mademoiselle was amused sidonie a wise echo added a sepulchral but faithful contralto the laughter of the two seemed at last to penetrate the candy man he fumbled with his horseshoe pin at length mademoiselle ex hausted turned her flushed beautiful face to the win dow candy man said she go away when i laugh sidonie pulls my hair i can but laugh while you remain there here is a note for mademoiselle said fe ice coming to the window in the room there is no justice said the candy man lift ing the handle of his cart and moving away three yards he moved and stopped loud shriek after shriek came from the window of mademoiselle quickly he ran back he heard a body thumping upon the floor and a sound as though heels beat alter nately upon it what is it be called sidonie s severe head came into the window mademoiselle is overcome by bad news she said one whom she loved with all her soul has gone you may have beard of him he is monsieur ives he sails across the ocean to morrow oh you men squaring the circle at the hazard of wearying you this tale of vehe ment emotions must be prefaced by a discourse on geometry nature moves in circles art in straight lines the natural is rounded the artificial is made up of angles a man lost in the snow wanders in spite of himself in perfect circles the city man s feet denaturalized by rectangular streets and floors carry him ever away from himself the round eyes of childhood typify innocence the narrowed line of the flirt s optic proves the in vasion of art the horizontal mouth is the mark of determined cunning who has not read nature s most spontaneous lyric in lips rounded for the candid kiss beauty is nature in perfection circularity is its chief attribute behold the full moon the enchant ing golf ball the domes of splendid temples the huckleberry pie the wedding ring the circus ring the ring for the waiter and the round of drinks on the other hand straight lines show that na ture has been deflected imagine venus s girdle transformed into a straight front when we begin to move in straight lines and turn sharp corners our natures begin to change the consequence is that nature being more adaptive than art tries to conform to its sterner regulations the result is often a rather curious product for in stance a prize chrysanthemum wood alcohol whis key a republican missouri cauliflower au gratin and a new yorker nature is lost quickest in a big city the cause is geometrical not moral the straight lines of its streets and architecture the rectangularity of its laws and social customs the undeviating pavements the hard severe depressing uncompromising rules of all its ways even of its recreation and sports coldly exhibit a sneering defiance of the curved line of nature wherefore it may be said that the big city has demonstrated the problem of squaring the circle and it may be added that this mathematical intro duction precedes an account of the fate of a kentucky feud that was imported to the city that has a habit of making its importations conform to its angles the feud began in the cumberland mountains be tween the folwell and the harkness families the first victim of the homespun vendetta was a possum dog belonging to bill harkness the harkness family evened up this dire loss by laying out the chief of the folwell clan the folwells were prompt at repartee they oiled up their squirrel rifles and made it feasible for bill harkness to follow his dog to a land where the possums come down when treed without the stroke of an ax the feud flourished for forty years harknesses were shot at the plough through their lamp lit cabin windows coming from camp meeting asleep in duello sober and otherwise singly and in family groups prepared and unprepared folwells had the branches of their family tree lopped off in similar ways as the traditions of their country prescribed and authorized by and by the pruning left but a single member of each family and then cal harkness probably reasoning that further pursuance of the controversy would give a too decided personal flavor to the feud suddenly disappeared from the relieved cumberlands baulking the avenging hand of sam the ultimate op posing folwell a year afterward sam folwell learned that his hereditary unsuppressed enemy was living in new york city sam turned over the big iron wash pot in the yard scraped off some of the soot which he mixed with lard and shined his boots with the com pound he put on his store clothes of butternut dyed black a white shirt and collar and packed a carpet sack with spartan lingerie he took his squirrel rifle from its hooks but put it back again with a sigh however ethical and plausible the habit might be in the cumberlands perhaps new york would not swallow his pose of hunting squirrels among the skyscrapers along broadway an ancient but reliable colt s revolver that he resurrected from a bureau drawer seemed to proclaim itself the pink of weapons for metropolitan adventure and vengeance this and a hunting knife in a leather sheath sam packed in the carpet sack as he started muleback for the lowland railroad station the last folwell turned in his saddle and looked grimly at the little cluster of white pine slabs in the clump of cedars that marked the folwell burying ground sam folwell arrived in new york in the night still moving and living in the free circles of nature he did not perceive the formidable pitiless restless fierce angles of the great city waiting in the dark to close about the rotundity of his heart and brain and mould him to the form of its millions of re shaped victims a cabby picked him out of the whirl as sam himself had often picked a nut from a bed of wind tossed autumn leaves and whisked him away to a hotel commensurate to his boots and carpet sack on the next morning the last of the folwells made his sortie into the city that sheltered the last hark ness the colt was thrust beneath his coat and se cured by a narrow leather belt the hunting knife hung between his shoulder blades with the haft an inch below his coat collar he knew this much that cal harkness drove an express wagon some where in that town and that he sam folwell had come to kill him and as he stepped upon the side walk the red came into his eye and the feud hate into his heart the clamor of the central avenues drew him thith erward he had half expected to see cal coming down the street in his shirt sleeves with a jug and a whip in his hand just as he would have seen him in frankfort or laurel city but an hour went by and cal did not appear perhaps he was waiting in ambush to shoot him from a door or a window sam kept a sharp eye on doors and windows for a while about noon the city tired of playing with its mouse and suddenly squeezed him with its straight lines sam folwell stood where two great rectangular arteries of the city cross he looked four ways and saw the world burled from its orbit and reduced by spirit level and tape to an edged and cornered plane all life moved on tracks in grooves accord ing to system within boundaries by rote the root of life was the cube root the measure of existence was square measure people streamed by in straight rows the horrible din and crash stupefied him sam leaned against the sharp corner of a stone building those faces passed him by thousands and none of them were turned toward him a sudden fool ish fear that he had died and was a spirit and that they could not see him seized him and then the city smote him with loneliness a fat man dropped out of the stream and stood a few feet distant waiting for his car sam crept to his side and shouted above the tumult into his ear the rankinses hogs weighed more n ourn a whole passel but the mast in thar neighborhood was a fine chance better than what it was down the fat man moved away unostentatiously and bought roasted chestnuts to cover his alarm sam felt the need of a drop of mountain dew across the street men passed in and out through swinging doors brief glimpses could be had of a glistening bar and its bedeckings the feudist crossed and essayed to enter again had art eliminated the familiar circle sam s hand found no door knob it slid in vain over a rectangular brass plate and polished oak with nothing even so large as a pin s head upon which his fingers might close abashed reddened heartbroken he walked away from the bootless door and sat upon a step a locust club tickled him in the ribs take a walk for yourself said the policeman you ve been loafing around here long enough at the next corner a shrill whistle sounded in sam s ear he wheeled around and saw a black browed vil lain scowling at him over peanuts heaped on a steam ing machine he started across the street an im mense engine running without mules with the voice of a bull and the smell of a smoky lamp whizzed past grazing his knee a cab driver bumped him with a hub and explained to him that kind words were in vented to be used on other occasions a motorman clanged his bell wildly and for once in his life cor roborated a cab driver a large lady in a changeable silk waist dug an elbow into his back and a newsy pensively pelted him with banana rinds murmuring i hates to do it but if anybody seen me let it pass cal harkness his day s work over and his express wagon stabled turned the sharp edge of the build ing that by the cheek of architects is modelled upon a safety razor out of the mass of hurrying people his eye picked up three yards away the surviving bloody and implacable foe of his kith and kin he stopped short and wavered for a moment be ing unarmed and sharply surprised but the keen mountaineer s eye of sam folwell had picked him out there was a sudden spring a ripple in the stream of passersby and the sound of sam s voice crying howdy cal i m durned glad to see ye and in the angles of broadway fifth avenue and twenty third street the cumberland feudists shook hands roses ruses and romance ravenel ravenel the traveller artist and poet threw his magazine to the floor sammy brown broker s clerk who sat by the window jumped what is it ravvy he asked the critics been hammering your stock down romance is dead said ravenel lightly when ravenel spoke lightly be was generally serious he picked up the magazine and fluttered its leaves even a philistine like you sammy said rave nel seriously a tone that insured him to be speak ing lightly ought to understand now here is a magazine that once printed poe and lowell and whitman and bret harte and du maurier and lanier and well that gives you the idea the current number has this literary feast to set before you an article on the stokers and coal bunkers of battleships an expose of the methods employed in making liver wurst a continued story of a standard preferred international baking powder deal in wall street a poem on the bear that the president missed an other story by a young woman who spent a week as a spy making overalls on the east side another fiction story that reeks of the garage and a cer tain make of automobile of course the title contains the words cupid and chauffeur an article on naval strategy illustrated with cuts of the spanish armada and the new staten island ferry boats an other story of a political boss who won the love of a fifth avenue belle by blackening her eye and refusing to vote for an iniquitous ordinance it doesn t say whether it was in the street cleaning department or congress and nineteen pages by the editors brag ging about the circulation the whole thing sammy is an obituary on romance sammy brown sat comfortably in the leather arm chair by the open window his suit was a vehement brown with visible checks beautifully matched in shade by the ends of four cigars that his vest pocket poorly concealed light tan were his shoes gray his socks sky blue his apparent linen snowy and high and adamantine his collar against which a black but terfly had alighted and spread his wings sammy s face least important was round and pleasant and pinkish and in his eyes you saw no haven for fleeing romance that window of ravenel s apartment opened upon an old garden full of ancient trees and shrubbery the apartment house towered above one side of it a high brick wall fended it from the street oppo site ravenel s window an old old mansion stood half hidden in the shade of the summer foliage the house was a castle besieged the city howled and roared and shrieked and beat upon its double doors and shook white fluttering checks above the wall offering terms of surrender the gray dust settled upon the trees the siege was pressed hotter but the draw bridge was not lowered no further will the language of chivalry serve inside lived an old gentleman who loved his home and did not wish to sell it that is all the romance of the besieged castle three or four times every week came sammy brown to ravenel s apartment he belonged to the poet s club for the former browns had been con spicuous though sammy bad been vulgarized by business he had no tears for departed romance the song of the ticker was the one that reached his heart and when it came to matters equine and batting scores he was something of a pink edition he loved to sit in the leather armchair by ravenel s window and ravenel didn t mind particularly sammy seemed to enjoy his talk and then the broker s clerk was such a perfect embodiment of modernity and the day s sordid practicality that ravenel rather liked to use him as a scapegoat i ll tell you what s the matter with you said sammy with the shrewdness that business had taught him the magazine has turned down some of your poetry stunts that s why you are sore at it that would be a good guess in wall street or in a campaign for the presidency of a woman s club said ravenel quietly now there is a poem if you will allow me to call it that of my own in this number of the magazine read it to me said sammy watching a cloud of pipe smoke be had just blown out the window ravenel was no greater than achilles no one is there is bound to be a spot the somebody or other must take bold of us somewhere when she dips us in the something or other that makes us invulnerable he read aloud this verse in the magazine the four roses one rose i twined within your hair white rose that spake of worth and one you placed upon your breast red rose love s seal of birth you plucked another from its stem tea rose that means for aye and one you gave that bore for me the thorns of memory that s a crackerjack said sammy admiringly there are five more verses said ravenel pa tiently sardonic one naturally pauses at the end of each of course oh let s have the rest old man shouted sammy contritely i didn t mean to cut you off i m not much of a poetry expert you know i never saw a poem that didn t look like it ought to have terminal facilities at the end of every verse reel off the rest of it ravenel sighed and laid the magazine down all right said sammy cheerfully we ll have it next time i ll be off now got a date at five o clock he took a last look at the shaded green garden and left whistling in an off key an untuneful air from a roofless farce comedy the next afternoon ravenel while polishing a ragged line of a new sonnet reclined by the window overlooking the besieged garden of the unmercenary baron suddenly he sat up spilling two rhymes and a syllable or two through the trees one window of the old mansion could be seen clearly in its window draped in flow ing white leaned the angel of all his dreams of ro mance and poesy young fresh as a drop of dew graceful as a spray of clematis conferring upon the garden hemmed in by the roaring traffic the air of a princess s bower beautiful as any flower sung by poet thus ravenel saw her for the first time she lingered for a while and then disappeared within leaving a few notes of a birdlike ripple of song to reach his entranced ears through the rattle of cabs and the snarling of the electric cars thus as if to challenge the poet s flaunt at ro mance and to punish him for his recreancy to the undying spirit of youth and beauty this vision bad dawned upon him with a thrilling and accusive power and so metabolic was the power that in an instant the atoms of ravenel s entire world were redistrib uted the laden drays that passed the house in which she lived rumbled a deep double bass to the tune of love the newsboys shouts were the notes of singing birds that garden was the pleasance of the capulets the janitor was an ogre himself a knight ready with sword lance or lute thus does romance show herself amid forests of brick and stone when she gets lost in the city and there has to be sent out a general alarm to find her again at four in the afternoon ravenel looked out across the garden in the window of his hopes were set four small vases each containing a great full blown rose red and white and as he gazed she leaned above them shaming them with her loveliness and seeming to direct her eyes pensively toward his own window and then as though she had caught his respectful but ardent regard she melted away leaving the fragrant emblems on the window sill yes emblems he would be unworthy if be had not understood she had read his poem the four roses it had reached her heart and this was its romantic answer of course she must know that ravenel the poet lived there across her garden his picture too she must have seen in the magazines the delicate tender modest flattering message could not be ignored ravenel noticed beside the roses a small flowering pot containing a plant without shame be brought his opera glasses and employed them from the cover of his window curtain a nutmeg geranium with the true poetic instinct be dragged a book of useless information from his shelves and tore open the leaves at the language of flowers geranium nutmeg i expect a meeting so romance never does things by halves if she comes back to you she brings gifts and her knitting and will sit in your chimney corner if you will let her and now ravenel smiled the lover smiles when be thinks he has won the woman who loves ceases to smile with victory he ends a battle she begins hers what a pretty idea to set the four roses in her window for him to see she must have a sweet poetic soul and now to contrive the meeting a whistling and slamming of doors preluded the coming of sammy brown ravenel smiled again even sammy brown was shone upon by the far flung rays of the renaissance sammy with his ultra clothes his horseshoe pin his plump face his trite slang his uncomprehending admiration of ravenel the broker s clerk made an excellent foil to the new bright unseen visitor to the poet s sombre apartment sammy went to his old seat by the window and looked out over the dusty green foliage in the garden then he looked at his watch and rose hastily by grabs he exclaimed twenty after four i can t stay old man i ve got a date at why did you come then asked ravenel with sarcastic jocularity if you had an engagement at that time i thought you business men kept better account of your minutes and seconds than that sammy hesitated in the doorway and turned pinker fact is ravvy be explained as to a customer whose margin is exhausted i didn t know i had it till i came i ll tell you old man there s a dandy girl in that old house next door that i m dead gone on i put it straight we re engaged the old man says nit but that don t go he keeps her pretty close i can see edith s window from yours here she gives me a tip when she s going shopping and i meet her it s to day maybe i ought to have explained sooner but i know it s all right with you so long how do you get your tip as you call it asked ravenel losing a little spontaneity from his smile roses said sammy briefly four of em to day means four o clock at the corner of broadway and twenty third but the geranium persisted ravenel clutch ing at the end of flying romance s trailing robe means half past shouted sammy from the hall see you to morrow the city of dreadful night during the recent warmed over spell said my friend

parks that be long to em there was a general exodus into central park by the communities existing along its borders in ten minutes after sundown you d have thought that there was an undress rehearsal of a potato famine in ireland and a kishineff massacre they come by families gangs clambake societies clans clubs and tribes from all sides to enjoy a cool sleep on the grass them that didn t have oil stoves brought along plenty of blankets so as not to be upset with the cold and discomforts of sleeping outdoors by building fires of the shade trees and huddling together in the bridle paths and burrowing under the grass where the ground was soft enough the likes of head of people successfully battled against the night air in central park alone ye know i live in the elegant furnished apart ment house called the beersheba flats over against the elevated portion of the new york central rail road when the order come to the flats that all hands must turn out and sleep in the park according to the instructions of the consulting committee of the city club and the murphy draying returfing and sod ding company there was a look of a couple of fires and an eviction all over the place the tenants began to pack up feather beds rub ber boots strings of garlic hot water bags porta ble canoes and scuttles of coal to take along for the sake of comfort the sidewalk looked like a russian camp in oyama s line of mareb there was waiting and lamenting up and down stairs from danny geog hegan s flat on the top floor to the apartments of missis goldsteinupski on the first for why says danny coming down and raging in his blue yarn socks to the janitor should i be turned out of me comfortable apartments to lay in the dirty grass like a rabbit tis like jerome to stir up trouble wid small matters like this instead of whist says officer reagan on the sidewalk rapping with his club tis not jerome tis by order of the polis commissioner turn out every one of yez and hike yerselves to the park now twas a peaceful and happy home that all of us had in them same beersheba flats the o dowds and the steinowitzes and the callahans and the cohens and the spizzinellis and the mcmanuses and the spiegelmayers and the joneses all nations of us we lived like one big family together and when the hot nights come along we kept a line of children reaching from the front door to kelly s on the corner passing along the cans of beer from one to another without the trouble of running after it and with no more clothing on than is provided for in the statutes sitting in all the windies with a cool growler in every one and your feet out in the air and the rosenstein girls singing on the fire escape of the sixth floor and patsy rourke s flute going in the eighth and the ladies calling each other synonyms out the win dies and now and then a breeze sailing in over mister depew s central i tell you the beersheba flats was a summer resort that made the catskills look like a bole in the ground with his person full of beer and his feet out the windy and his old woman frying pork chops over a charcoal furnace and the children dancing in cotton slips on the sidewalk around the organ grinder and the rent paid for a week what does a man want better on a hot night than that and then comes this ruling of the polis driving people out o their comfortable homes to sleep in parks twas for all the world like a ukase of them rus sians twill be heard from again at next election time well then officer reagan drives the whole lot of us to the park and turns us in by the nearest gate tis dark under the trees and all the children sets up to howling that they want to go home ye ll pass the night in this stretch of woods and scenery says officer reagan twill be fine and imprisonment for insoolting the park commis sioner and the chief of the weather bureau if ye re fuse i m in charge of thirty acres between here and the agyptian monument and i advise ye to give no trouble tis sleeping on the grass yez all have been condemned to by the authorities yez ll be permitted to leave in the morning but ye must retoorn be night me orders was silent on the subject of bail but i find out if tis required and there ll be bondsmen at the gate there being no lights except along the automo bile drives us tenants of the beersheba flats prepared to spend the night as best we could in the raging forest them that brought blankets and kin dling wood was best off they got fires started and wrapped the blankets round their heads and laid down cursing in the grass there was nothing to see nothing to drink nothing to do in the dark we had no way of telling friend or foe except by feeling the noses of em i brought along me last winter overcoat me toothbrush some quinine pills and the red quilt off the bed in me flat three times during the night somebody rolled on me quilt and stuck his knees against the adam s apple of me and three times i judged his character by running me hand over his face and three times i rose up and kicked the in truder down the hill to the gravelly walk below and then some one with a flavor of kelly s whiskey snug gled up to me and i found his nose turned up the right way and i says is that you then patsey and he says it is carney how long do you think it ll last i m no weather prophet says i but if they bring out a strong anti tammany ticket next fall it ought to get us home in time to sleep on a bed once or twice before they line us up at the polls a playing of my flute into the airshaft i says patsey rourke and a perspiring in me own windy to the joyful noise of the passing trains and the smell of liver and onions and a reading of the latest mur der in the smoke of the cooking is well enough for me says he what is this herding us in grass for not to mention the crawling things with legs that walk up the trousers of us and the jersey snipes that peck at us masquerading under the name and denom ination of mosquitoes what is it all for carney and the rint going on just the same over at the flats tis the great annual municipal free night outing lawn party says i given by the polis hetty green and the drug trust during the heated season they hold a week of it in the principal parks tis a scheme to reach that portion of the people that s not worth taking up to north beach for a fish fry i can t sleep on the ground says patsey wid any benefit i have the hay fever and the rheuma tism and me car is full of ants well the night goes on and the ex tenants of the flats groans and stumbles around in the dark trying to find rest and recreation in the forest the children is screaming with the coldness and the jan itor makes hot tea for em and keeps the fires going with the signboards that point to the tavern and the casino the tenants try to lay down on the grass by families in the dark but you re lucky if you can sleep next to a man from the same floor or believing in the same religion now and then a murpby acci dental rolls over on the grass of a rosenstein or a cohen tries to crawl under the o grady bush and then there s a feeling of noses and somebody is rolled down the hill to the driveway and stays there there is some hair pulling among the women folks and everybody spanks the nearest howling kid to him by the sense of feeling only regardless of its parentage and ownership tis hard to keep up the social dis tinctions in the dark that flourish by daylight in the beersheba flats mrs rafferty that despises the asphalt that a dago treads on wakes up in the morn ing with her feet in the bosom of antonio spizzinelli and mike o dowd that always threw peddlers down stairs as fast as he came upon em has to unwind old isaacstein s whiskers from around his neck and wake up the whole gang at daylight but here and there some few got acquainted and overlooked the discom forts of the elements there was five engagements to be married announced at the flats the next morning about midnight i gets up and wrings the dew out of my hair and goes to the side of the driveway and sits down at one side of the park i could see the lights in the streets and houses and i was thinking how happy them folks was who could chase the duck and smoke their pipes at their windows and keep cool and pleasant like nature intended for em to just then an automobile stops by me and a fine looking well dressed man steps out me man says he can you tell me why all these people are lying around on the grass in the park i thought it was against the rules twas an ordinance says i just passed by the polis department and ratified by the turf cut ters association providing that all persons not car rying a license number on their rear axles shall keep in the public parks until further notice fortu nately the orders comes this year during a spell of fine weather and the mortality except on the borders of the lake and along the automobile drives will not be any greater than usual who are these people on the side of the bill asks the man sure says i none others than the tenants of the beersheba flats a fine home for any man especially on hot nights may daylight come soon they come here be night says be and breathe in the pure air and the fragrance of the flowers and trees they do that says be coming every night from the burning beat of dwellings of brick and stone and wood says i and marble and plaster and iron the matter will be attended to at once says the man putting up his book are ye the park commissioner i asks i own the beersheba flats says he god bless the grass and the trees that give extra benefits to a man s tenants the rents shall be raised fifteen per cent to morrow good night says he the easter of the soul it is hardly likely that a goddess may die then eastre the old saxon goddess of spring must be laughing in her muslin sleeve at people who believe that easter her namesake exists only along certain strips of fifth avenue pavement after church service aye it belongs to the world the ptarmigan in chilkoot pass discards his winter white feathers for brown the patagonian beau brummell oils his chi gnon and clubs him another sweetheart to drag to his skull strewn flat and down in chrystie street mr tiger mcquirk arose with a feeling of disquiet that be did not understand with a prac tised foot be rolled three of his younger brothers like logs out of his way as they lay sleeping on the floor before a foot square looking glass hung by the win dow he stood and shaved himself if that may seem to you a task too slight to be thus impressively chron icled i bear with you you do not know of the areas to be accomplished in traversing the cheek and chin of mr mcquirk mcquirk senior had gone to work long before the big son of the house was idle he was a marble cutter and the marble cutters were out on a strike what ails ye asked his mother looking at him curiously are ye not feeling well the morning maybe now he s thinking along of annie maria doyle im pudently explained younger brother tim ten years old tiger reached over the hand of a champion and swept the small mcquirk from his chair i feel fine said he beyond a touch of the i don t know wbat you call its i feel like there was going to be earthquakes or music or a trifle of chills and fever or maybe a picnic i don t know how i feel i feel like knocking the face off a policeman or else maybe like playing coney island straight across the board from pop corn to the elephant boudabs it s the spring in yer bones said mrs mcquirk it s the sap risin time was when i couldn t keep me feet still nor me head cool when the earthworms began to crawl out in the dew of the mornin tis a bit of tea will do ye good made from pipsissewa and gentian bark at the druggist s back up said mr mcquirk impatiently there s no spring in sight there s snow yet on the shed in donovan s backyard and yesterday they puts open cars on the sixth avenue lines and the janitors have quit ordering coal and that means six weeks more of winter by all the signs that be after breakfast mr mcquirk spent fifteen minutes before the corrugated mirror subjugating his hair and arranging his green and purple ascot with its amethyst tombstone pin eloquent of his chosen calling since the strike had been called it was this par ticular striker s habit to hie himself each morning to the corner saloon of flaherty brothers and there establish himself upon the sidewalk with one foot resting on the bootblack s stand observing the panorama of the street until the pace of time brought twelve o clock and the dinner hour and mr tiger mcquirk with his athletic seventy inches well trained in sport and battle his smooth pale solid amiable face blue where the razor had trav elled his carefully considered clothes and air of capa bility was himself a spectacle not displeasing to the eye but on this morning mr mcquirk did not hasten immediately to his post of leisure and observation something unusual that he could not quite grasp was in the air something disturbed his thoughts ruffled his senses made him at once languid irritable elated dissastisfied and sportive he was no diagnostician and he did not know that lent was breaking up physiologically in his system mrs mcquirk had spoken of spring sceptically tiger looked about him for signs few they were the organ grinders were at work but they were always precocious harbingers it was near enough spring for them to go penny hunting when the skating ball dropped at the park in the milliners windows easter hats grave gay and jubilant blos somed there were green patches among the side walk debris of the grocers on a third story window sill the first elbow cushion of the season old gold stripes on a crimson ground supported the kimo noed arms of a pensive brunette the wind blew cold from the east river but the sparrows were fly ing to the eaves with straws a second hand store combining foresight with faith had set out an ice chest and baseball goods and then tiger s eye discrediting these signs fell upon one that bore a bud of promise from a bright new lithograph the head of capricornus con fronted him betokening the forward and heady brew mr mcquirk entered the saloon and called for his glass of bock he threw his nickel on the bar raised the glass set it down without tasting it and strolled toward the door wot s the matter lord bolinbroke inquired the sarcastic bartender want a chiny vase or a gold lined epergne to drink it out of hey say said mr mcquirk wheeling and shooting out a horizontal hand and a forty five degree chin you know your place only when it comes for givin titles i ve changed me mind about drinkin see you got your money ain t you wait till you get stung before you get the droop to your lip will you thus mr quirk added mutability of desires to the strange humors that had taken possession of him leaving the saloon he walked away twenty steps and leaned in the open doorway of lutz the barber he and lutz were friends masking their sentiments behind abuse and bludgeons of repartee irish loafer roared lutz how do you do so not yet haf der bolicemans or der catcher of dogs done deir duty hello dutch said mr mcquirk can t get your mind off of frankfurters can you bah exclaimed the german coming and lean ing in the door i haf a soul above frankfurters to day dere is springtime in der air i can feel it coming in ofer der mud of der streets and das ice in der river soon will dere be bienics in der islands mit kegs of beer under der trees say said mr mcquirk setting his bat on one side is everybody

no boetry said lutz true it is yedt cold und in der city we haf not many of der signs but dere are dree kinds of beoble dot should always feel der approach of spring first dey are boets lovers and poor vidows mr mcquirk went on his way still possessed by the strange perturbation that he did not understand something was lacking to his comfort and it made him half angry because be did not know what it was two blocks away he came upon a foe one conover whom he was bound in honor to engage in combat mr mcquirk made the attack with the charac teristic suddenness and fierceness that had gained for him the endearing sobriquet of tiger the de fence of mr conover was so prompt and admirable that the conflict was protracted until the onlookers un selfishly gave the warning cry of cheese it the cop the principals escaped easily by running through the nearest open doors into the communi cating backyards at the rear of the houses mr mcquirk emerged into another street he stood by a lamp post for a few minutes engaged in thought and then he turned and plunged into a small notion and news shop a red haired young woman eating gum drops came and looked freezingly at him across the ice bound steppes of the counter say lady he said have you got a song book with this in it let s see bow it leads off when the springtime comes well wander in the dale love and whisper of those days of yore i m having a friend explained mr mcquirk laid up with a broken leg and he sent me after it he s a devil for songs and poetry when he can t get out to drink we have not replied the young woman with un concealed contempt but there is a new song out that begins this way let us sit together in the old armchair and while the firelight flickers we ll be comfortable there there will be no profit in following mr tiger mcquirk through his further vagaries of that day until he comes to stand knocking at the door of annie maria doyle the goddess eastre it seems had guided his footsteps aright at last is that you now jimmy mcquirk she cried smiling through the opened door annie maria had never accepted the tiger well whatever come out in the ball said mr mcquirk i want to ask yer opinion of the weather on the level are you crazy sure said annie maria i am said the tiger they ve been telling me all day there was spring in the air were they liars or am i dear me said annie maria haven t you no ticed it i can almost smell the violets and the green grass of course there ain t any yet it s just a kind of feeling you know that s what i m getting at said mr mcquirk i ve had it i didn t

and it s you i want i go to work next monday and i make four dollars a day spiel up old girl do we make a team jimmy sighed annie maria suddenly disap pearing in his overcoat don t you see that spring is all over the world right this minute but you yourself remember how that day ended beginning with so fine a promise of vernal things late in the afternoon the air chilled and an inch of snow fell even so late in march on fifth ave nue the ladies drew their winter furs close about them only in the florists windows could be per ceived any signs of the morning smile of the coming goddess eastre at six o clock herr lutz began to close his shop he beard a well known shout hello dutch tiger mcquirk in his shirt sleeves with his hat on the back of his bead stood outside in the whirling snow puffing at a black cigar donnerwetter shouted lutz der vinter he has gome back again yet yer a liar dutch called back mr mcquirk with friendly geniality it s springtime by the watch the fool killer down south whenever any one perpetrates some particularly monumental piece of foolishness every body says send for jesse holmes jesse holmes is the fool killer of course he is a myth like santa claus and jack frost and general prosperity and all those concrete conceptions that are supposed to represent an idea that nature has failed to embody the wisest of the southrons can not tell you whence comes the fool killer s name but few and happy are the households from the ro anoke to the rio grande in which the name of jesse holmes has not been pronounced or invoked always with a smile and often with a tear is he summoned to his official duty a busy man is jesse holmes i remember the clear picture of him that hung on the walls of my fancy during my barefoot days when i was dodging his oft threatened devoirs to me be was a terrible old man in gray clothes with a long ragged gray beard and reddish fierce eyes i looked to see him come stumping up the road in a cloud of dust with a white oak staff in his hand and his shoes tied with leather thongs i may yet but this is a story not a sequel i have taken notice with regret that few stories worth reading have been written that did not con tain drink of some sort down go the fluids from arizona dick s three fingers of red pizen to the in efficacious oolong that nerves lionel montressor to repartee in the dotty dialogues so in such good company i may introduce an absinthe drip one absinthe drip dripped through a silver dripper orderly opalescent cool green eyed deceptive kerner was a fool besides that he was an artist and my good friend now if there is one thing on earth utterly despicable to another it is an artist in the eyes of an author whose story he has illus trated just try it once write a story about a mining camp in idiho sell it spend the money and then six months later borrow a quarter or a dime and buy the magazine containing it you find a full page wash drawing of your hero black bill the cowboy somewhere in your story you em ployed the word horse aha the artist has grasped the idea black bill has on the regulation trousers of the m f h of the westchester county hunt he carries a parlor rifle and wears a mon ocle in the distance is a section of forty second street during a search for a lost gas pipe and the taj mahal the famous mausoleum in india enough i hated kerner and one day i met him and we became friends he was young and glori ously melancholy because his spirits were so high and life bad so much in store for him yes he was almost riotously sad that was his youth when a man begins to be hilarious in a sorrowful way you can bet a million that he is dyeing his hair ker ner s hair was plentiful and carefully matted as an artist s thatch should be he was a cigaretteur and be audited his dinners with red wine but most of all be was a fool and wisely i envied him and listened patiently while he knocked velasquez and tintoretto once he told me that he liked a story of mine that he bad come across in an anthology he described it to me and i was sorry that mr fitz james o brien was dead and could not learn of the eulogy of his work but mostly kerner made few breaks and was a consistent fool i d better explain what i mean by that there was a girl now a girl as far as i am concerned is a thing that belongs in a seminary or an album but i conceded the existence of the animal in order to retain kerner s friendship he showed me her picture in a locket she was a blonde or a brunette i have forgotten which she worked in a factory for eight dollars a week lest factories quote this wage by way of vindication i will add that the girl bad worked for five years to reach that supreme ele vation of remuneration beginning at per week kerner s father was worth a couple of millions he was willing to stand for art but he drew the line at the factory girl so kerner disinherited his father and walked out to a cheap studio and lived on sausages for breakfast and on farroni for dinner farroni had the artistic soul and a line of credit for painters and poets nicely adjusted sometimes ker rier sold a picture and bought some new tapestry a ring and a dozen silk cravats and paid farroni two dollars on account one evening kerner had me to dinner with himself and the factory girl they were to be married as soon as kerner could slosh paint profitably as for the ex father s two millions pouf she was a wonder small and half way pretty and as much at her ease in that cheap cafe as though she were only in the palmer house chicago with a souvenir spoon already safely hidden in her shirt waist she was natural two things i noticed about her especially her belt buckle was exactly in the middle of her back and she didn t tell us that a large man with a ruby stick pin had followed her up all the way from fourteenth street was kerner such a fool i wondered and then i thought of the quantity of striped cuffs and blue glass beads that can buy for the heathen and i said to myself that he was and then elise certainly that was her name told us merrily that the brown spot on her waist was caused by her landlady knocking at the door while she the girl confound the english language was heating an iron over the gas jet and she hid the iron under the bedclothes until the coast was clear and there was the piece of chewing gum stuck to it when she began to iron the waist and well i wondered bow in the world the chewing gum came to be there don t they ever stop chewing it a while after that don t be impatient the ab sinthe drip is coming now kerner and i were dining at farroni s a mandolin and a guitar were being attacked the room was full of smoke in nice long crinkly layers just like the artists draw the steam from a plum pudding on christmas posters and a lady in a blue silk and gasolined gauntlets was be ginning to bum an air from the catskills kerner said i you are a fool of course said kerner i wouldn t let her go on working not my wife what s the use to wait she s willing i sold that water color of the pali sades yesterday we could cook on a two burner gas stove you know the ragouts i can throw together yes i think we will marry next week kerner said i you are a fool have an absinthe drip said kerner grandly to night you are the guest of art in paying quan tities i think we will get a flat with a bath i never tried one i mean an absinthe drip said i the waiter brought it and poured the water slowly over the ice in the dripper it looks exactly like the mississippi river water in the big bend below natchez said i fascinated gazing at the be muddled drip there are such flats for eight dollars a week said kerner you are a fool said i and began to sip the filtration what you need i continued is the official attention of one jesse holmes kerner not being a southerner did not compre hend so he sat sentimental figuring on his flat in his sordid artistic way while i gazed into the green eyes of the sophisticated spirit of wormwood presently i noticed casually that a procession of bacchantes limned on the wall immediately below the ceiling bad begun to move traversing the room from right to left in a gay and spectacular pilgrimage i did not confide my discovery to kerner the artistic temperament is too high strung to view such devia tions from the natural laws of the art of kalsomining i sipped my absinthe drip and sawed wormwood one absinthe drip is not much but i said again to kerner kindly you are a fool and then in the vernacular jesse holmes for yours and then i looked around and saw the fool killer as he had always appeared to my imagination sitting at a nearby table and regarding us with his reddish fatal relentless eyes he was jesse holmes from top to toe he had the long gray ragged beard the gray clothes of ancient cut the executioner s look and the dusty shoes of one who bad been called from afar his eyes were turned fixedly upon kerner i shuddered to think that i bad invoked him from his assiduous southern duties i thought of flying and then i kept my seat reflecting that many men bad es caped his ministrations when it seemed that nothing short of an appointment as ambassador to spain could save them from him i had called my brother kerner a fool and was in danger of hell fire that was nothing but i would try to save him from jesse holmes the fool killer got up from his table and came over to ours he rested his hands upon it and turned his burning vindictive eyes upon kerner ig noring me you are a hopeless fool be said to the artist haven t you had enough of starvation yet i of fer you one more opportunity give up this girl and come back to your home refuse and you must take the consequences the fool killer s threatening face was within a foot of his victim s but to my horror kerner made not the slightest sign of being aware of his presence we will be married next week be muttered ab sent mindedly with my studio furniture and some second hand stuff we can make out you have decided your own fate said the fool killer in a low but terrible voice you may con sider yourself as one dead you have had your last chance in the moonlight went on kerner softly we will sit under the skylight with our guitar and sing away the false delights of pride and money on your own head be it hissed the fool killer and my scalp prickled when i perceived that neither kerner s eyes nor his ears took the slightest cog nizance of jesse holmes and then i knew that for some reason the veil had been lifted for me alone and that i bad been elected to save my friend from de struction at the fool killer s bands something of the fear and wonder of it must have showed itself in my face excuse me said kerner with his wan amiable smile was i talking to myself i think it is getting to be a habit with me the fool killer turned and walked out of far ronils wait here for me said i rising i must speak to that man had you no answer for him because you are a fool must you die like a mouse under his foot could you not utter one squeak in your own defence you are drunk said kerner heartlessly no one addressed me the destroyer of your mind said i stood above you just now and marked you for his victim you are not blind or deaf i recognized no such person said kerner i have seen no one but you at this table sit down hereafter you shall have no more absinthe drips wait here said i furious if you don t care for your own life i will save it for you i hurried out and overtook the man in gray half way down the block he looked as i bad seen him in my fancy a thousand times truculent gray and awful he walked with the white oak staff and but for the street sprinkler the dust would have been fly ing under his tread i caught him by the sleeve and steered him to a dark angle of a building i knew he was a myth and i did not want a cop to see me conversing with va cancy for i might land in bellevue minus my silver matchbox and diamond ring jesse holmes said i facing him with apparent bravery i know you i have heard of you all my life i know now what a scourge you have been to your country instead of killing fools you have been murdering the youth and genius that are necessary to make a people live and grow great you are a fool yourself holmes you began killing off the brightest and best of our countrymen three generations ago when the old and obsolete standards of society and honor and orthodoxy were narrow and bigoted you proved that when you put your murderous mark upon my friend kerner the wisest chap i ever knew in my life the fool killer looked at me grimly and closely you ve a queer jag said he curiously oh yes i see who you are now you were sitting with him at the table well if i m not mistaken i heard you call him a fool too i did said i i delight in doing so it is from envy by all the standards that you know he is the most egregious and grandiloquent and gorgeous fool in all the world that s why you want to kill him would you mind telling me who or what you think i am asked the old man i laughed boisterously and then stopped suddenly for i remembered that it would not do to be seen so hilarious in the company of nothing but a brick wall you are jesse holmes the fool killer i said solemnly and you are going to kill my friend ker ner i don t know who rang you up but if you do kill him i ll see that you get pinched for it that is i added despairingly if i can get a cop to see you they have a poor eye for mortals and i think it would take the whole force to round up a myth mur derer well said the fool killer briskly i must be going you had better go home and sleep it off good night at this i was moved by a sudden fear for kerner to a softer and more pleading mood i leaned against the gray man s sleeve and besought him good mr fool killer please don t kill little ker ner why can t you go back south and kill con gressmen and clay caters and let us alone why don t you go up on fifth avenue and kill millionaires that keep their money locked up and won t let young fools marry because one of em lives on the wrong street come and have a drink jesse will you never get on to your job do you know this girl that your friend has made himself a fool about asked the fool killer i have the honor said i and that s why i called kerner a fool he is a fool because he has waited so long before marrying her he is a fool because be has been waiting in the hopes of getting the consent of some absurd two million dollar fool parent or something of the sort maybe said the fool killer maybe i i might have looked at it differently would you mind going back to the restaurant and bringing your friend kerner here oh what s the use jesse i yawned he can t see you he didn t know you were talking to him at the table you are a fictitious character you know maybe he can this time will you go fetch him all right said i but i ve a suspicion that you re not strictly sober jesse you seem to be wa vering and losing your outlines don t vanish before i get back i went back to kerner and said there s a man with an invisible homicidal mania waiting to see you outside i believe he wants to murder you come along you won t see him so there s nothing to be frightened about kerner looked anxious why said be i had no idea one absinthe would do that you d better stick to wurzburger i ll walk home with you i led him to jesse holmes s rudolf said the fool killer i ll give in bring her up to the house give me your hand boy good for you dad said kerner shaking hands with the old man you ll never regret it after you know her so you did see him when he was talking to you at the table i asked kerner we hadn t spoken to each other in a year said kerner it s all right now i walked away where are you going called kerner i am going to look for jesse holmes i an swered with dignity and reserve transients in arcadia there is a hotel on broadway that has escaped discovery by the summer resort promoters it is deep and wide and cool its rooms are finished in dark oak of a low temperature home made breezes and deep green shrubbery give it the delights without the inconveniences of the adirondacks one can mount its broad staircases or glide dreamily upward in its aerial elevators attended by guides in brass but tons with a serene joy that alpine climbers have never attained there is a chef in its kitchen who will prepare for you brook trout better than the white mountains ever served sea food that would turn old point comfort by gad sah green with envy and maine venison that would melt the official heart of a game warden a few have found out this oasis in the july desert of manhattan during that month you will see the hotel s reduced array of guests scattered luxuriously about in the cool twilight of its lofty dining room gazing at one another across the snowy waste of un occupied tables silently congratulatory superfluous watchful pneumatically moving wait ers hover near supplying every want before it is ex pressed the temperature is perpetual april the ceiling is painted in water colors to counterfeit a sum mer sky across which delicate clouds drift and do not vanish as those of nature do to our regret the pleasing distant roar of broadway is trans formed in the imagination of the happy guests to the noise of a waterfall filling the woods with its restful sound at every strange footstep the guests turn an anxious ear fearful lest their retreat be discovered and invaded by the restless pleasure seekers who are forever hounding nature to her deepest lairs thus in the depopulated caravansary the little band of connoisseurs jealously bide themselves during the heated season enjoying to the uttermost the de lights of mountain and seashore that art and skill have gathered and served to them in this july came to the hotel one whose card that she sent to the clerk for her name to be registered read mme he oise d arcy beaumont madame beaumont was a guest such as the hotel lotus loved she possessed the fine air of the e ite tempered and sweetened by a cordial graciousness that made the hotel employees her slaves bell boys fought for the honor of answering her ring the clerks but for the question of ownership would have deeded to her the hotel and its contents the other guests regarded her as the final touch of feminine exclusiveness and beauty that rendered the entourage perfect this super excellent guest rarely left the hotel her habits were consonant with the customs of the dis criminating patrons of the hotel lotus to enjoy that delectable hostelry one must forego the city as though it were leagues away by night a brief ex cursion to the nearby roofs is in order but during the torrid day one remains in the umbrageous fast nesses of the lotus as a trout hangs poised in the pel lucid sanctuaries of his favorite pool though alone in the hotel lotus madame beau mont preserved the state of a queen whose loneliness was of position only she breakfasted at ten a cool sweet leisurely delicate being who glowed softly in the dimness like a jasmine flower in the dusk but at dinner was madame s glory at its height she wore a gown as beautiful and immaterial as the mist from an unseen cataract in a mountain gorge the nomenclature of this gown is beyond the guess of the scribe always pale red roses reposed against its lace garnished front it was a gown that the bead waiter viewed with respect and met at the door you thought of paris when you saw it and maybe of mysterious countesses and certainly of versailles and rapiers and mrs fiske and rouge et noir there was an untraceable rumor in the hotel lotus that madame was a cosmopolite and that she was pulling with her slender white bands certain strings between the nations in the favor of russia being a citi zeness of the world s smoothest roads it was small wonder that she was quick to recognize in the refined purlieus of the hotel lotus the most desirable spot in america for a restful sojourn during the heat of mid summer on the third day of madame beaumont s residence in the hotel a young man entered and registered him self as a guest his clothing to speak of his points in approved order was quietly in the mode his features good and regular his expression that of a poised and sophisticated man of the world he in formed the clerk that he would remain three or four days inquired concerning the sailing of european steamships and sank into the blissful inanition of the nonpareil hotel with the contented air of a traveller in his favorite inn the young man not to question the veracity of the register was harold farrington he drifted into the exclusive and calm current of life in the lotus so tactfully and silently that not a ripple alarmed his fellow seekers after rest he ate in the lotus and of its patronym and was lulled into blissful peace with the other fortunate mariners in one day he acquired his table and his waiter and the fear lest the panting chasers after repose that kept broadway warm should pounce upon and destroy this contiguous but covert haven after dinner on the next day after the arrival of harold farrington madame beaumont dropped her handkerchief in passing out mr farrington recov ered and returned it without the effusiveness of a seeker after acquaintance perhaps there was a mystic freemasonry between the discriminating guests of the lotus perhaps they were drawn one to another by the fact of their common good fortune in discovering the acme of sum mer resorts in a broadway hotel words delicate in courtesy and tentative in departure from formality passed between the two and as if in the expedient atmosphere of a real summer resort an acquaintance grew flowered and fructified on the spot as does the mystic plant of the conjuror for a few moments they stood on a balcony upon which the corridor ended and tossed the feathery ball of conversation one tires of the old resorts said madame beau mont with a faint but sweet smile what is the use to fly to the mountains or the seashore to escape noise and dust when the very people that make both follow us there even on the ocean remarked farrington sadly the philistines be upon you the most exclusive steamers are getting to be scarcely more than ferry boats heaven help us when the summer resorter dis covers that the lotus is further away from broadway than thousand islands or mackinac i hope our secret will be safe for a week any how said madame with a sigh and a smile i do not know where i would go if they should descend upon the dear lotus i know of but one place so de lightful in summer and that is the castle of count polinski in the ural mountains i hear that baden baden and cannes are almost deserted this season said farrington year by year the old resorts fall in disrepute perhaps many others like ourselves are seeking out the quiet nooks that are overlooked by the majority i promise myself three days more of this delicious rest said madame beaumont on monday the cedric sails harold farrington s eyes proclaimed his regret i too must leave on monday he said but i do not go abroad madame beaumont shrugged one round shoulder in a foreign gesture one cannot bide here forever charming though it may be the chateau has been in preparation for me longer than a month those house parties that one must give what a nuisance but i shall never for get my week in the hotel lotus nor shall i said farrington in a low voice and i shall never forgive the cedric on sunday evening three days afterward the two sat at a little table on the same balcony a discreet waiter brought ices and small glasses of claret cup madame beaumont wore the same beautiful even ing gown that she had worn each day at dinner she seemed thoughtful near her hand on the table lay a small chatelaine purse after she had eaten her ice she opened the purse and took out a one dollar bill mr farrington she said with the smile that had won the hotel lotus i want to tell you some thing i m going to leave before breakfast in the morning because i ve got to go back to my work i m behind the hosiery counter at casey s mammoth store and my vacation s up at eight o clock to morrow that paper dollar is the last cent i ll see till i draw my eight dollars salary next saturday night you re a real gentleman and you ve been good to me and i wanted to tell you before i went i ve been saving up out of my wages for a year just for this vacation i wanted to spend one week like a lady if i never do another one i wanted to get up when i please instead of having to crawl out at seven every morning and i wanted to live on the best and be waited on and ring bells for things just like rich folks do now i ve done it and i ve had the happiest time i ever expect to have in my life i m going back to my work and my little hall bedroom satisfied for another year i wanted to tell you about it mr farrington because i i thought you kind of liked me and i i liked you but oh i couldn t help deceiving you up till now for it was all just like a fairy tale to me so i talked about europe and the things i ve read about in other countries and made you think i was a great lady this dress i ve got on it s the only one i have that s fit to wear i bought from o dowd levin sky on the instalment plan seventy five dollars is the price and it was made to measure i paid down and they re to collect a week till it s paid for that ll be about all i have to say mr farrington except that my name is mamie siviter instead of madame beaumont and i thank you for your attentions this dollar will pay the instalment due on the dress to morrow i guess i ll go up to my room now harold farrington listened to the recital of the lotus s loveliest guest with an impassive countenance when she had concluded he drew a small book like a checkbook from his coat pocket he wrote upon a blank form in this with a stub of pencil tore out the leaf tossed it over to his companion and took up the paper dollar i ve got to go to work too in the morning he said and i might as well begin now there s a receipt for the dollar instalment i ve been a col lector for o dowd levinsky for three years funny ain t it that you and me both had the same idea about spending our vacation i ve always wanted to put up at a swell hotel and i saved up out of my twenty per and did it say mame how about a trip to coney saturday night on the boat what the face of the pseudo madame heloise d arcy beaumont beamed oh you bet i ll go mr farrington the store closes at twelve on saturdays i guess coney ll be all right even if we did spend a week with the swells below the balcony the sweltering city growled and buzzed in the july night inside the hotel lotus the tempered cool shadows reigned and the solicitous waiter single footed near the low windows ready at a nod to serve madame and her escort at the door of the elevator farrington took his leave and madame beaumont made her last ascent but before they reached the noiseless cage be said just forget that harold farrington will you mcmanus is the name james mcmanus some call me jimmy good night jimmy said madame the rathskeller and the rose miss posie carrington had earned her suc cess she began life handicapped by the family name of boggs in the small town known as cranberry corners at the age of eighteen she had acquired the name of carrington and a position in the chorus of a metropolitan burlesque company thence upward she had ascended by the legitimate and delectable steps of broiler member of the famous dickey bird octette in the successful musical comedy fudge and fellows leader of the potato bug dance in fol de rol and at length to the part of the maid toinette in the king s bath robe which captured the critics and gave her her chance and when we come to consider miss carrington she is in the heydey of flattery fame and fizz and that astute manager herr timothy goldstein has her signature to iron clad papers that she will star the coming season in dyde rich s new play paresis by gaslight promptly there came to herr timothy a capable twentieth century young character actor by the name of highsmith who besought engagement as sol haytosser the comic and chief male character part in paresis by gaslight my boy said goldstein take the part if you can get it miss carrington won t listen to any of my suggestions she has turned down half a dozen of the best imitators of the rural dub in the city she declares she won t set a foot on the stage un less haytosser is the best that can be raked up she was raised in a village you know and when a broadway orchid sticks a straw in his hair and tries to call himself a clover blossom she s on all right i asked her in a sarcastic vein if she thought den man thompson would make any kind of a show in the part oh no says she i don t want him or john drew or jim corbett or any of these swell actors that don t know a turnip from a turnstile i want the real article so my boy if you want to play i sol haytosser you will have to convince miss carrington luck be with you highsmith took the train the next day for cran berry corners he remained in that forsaken and inanimate village three days he found the boggs family and corkscrewed their history unto the third and fourth generation he amassed the facts and the local color of cranberry corners the village had not grown as rapidly as had miss carrington the actor estimated that it had suffered as few actual changes since the departure of its solitary follower of thespis as had a stage upon which four years is supposed to have elapsed he absorbed cran berry corners and returned to the city of chameleon changes it was in the rathskeller that highsmith made the hit of his histrionic career there is no need to name the place there is but one rathskeller where you could hope to find miss posie carrington after a performance of the king s bath robe there was a jolly small party at one of the tables that drew many eyes miss carrington petite mar vellous bubbling electric fame drunken shall be named first herr goldstein follows sonorous curly haired heavy a trifle anxious as some bear that had caught somehow a butterfly in his claws next a man condemned to a newspaper sad courted armed analyzing for press agent s dross every sen tence that was poured over him eating his a la new burg in the silence of greatness to conclude a youth with parted hair a name that is ochre to red journals and gold on the back of a supper check these sat at a table while the musicians played while waiters moved in the mazy performance of their duties with their backs toward all who desired their service and all was bizarre and merry because it was nine feet below the level of the sidewalk at a being entered the rathskeller the first violin perceptibly flatted a c that should have been natural the clarionet blew a bubble instead of a grace note miss carrington giggled and the youth with parted hair swallowed an olive seed exquisitely and irreproachably rural was the new entry a lank disconcerted hesitating young man it was flaxen haired gaping of mouth awkward stricken to misery by the lights and company his clothing was butternut with bright blue tie showing four inches of bony wrist and white socked ankle he upset a chair sat in another one curled a foot around a table leg and cringed at the approach of a waiter you may fetch me a glass of lager beer he said in response to the discreet questioning of the servitor the eyes of the rathskeller were upon him he was as fresh as a collard and as ingenuous as a hay rake he let his eye rove about the place as one who re gards big eyed hogs in the potato patch his gaze rested at length upon miss carrington he rose and went to her table with a lateral shining smile and a blush of pleased trepidation how re ye miss posie he said in accents not to be doubted don t ye remember me bill sum mers the summerses that lived back of the black smith shop i reckon i ve growed up some since ye left cranberry corners liza perry lowed i might see ye in the city while i was here you know liza married benny stanfield and she says ah say interrupted miss carrington brightly lize perry is never married what oh the freckles of her married in june grinned the gossip and livin in the old tatum place ham riley perfessed reli gion old mrs blithers sold her place to cap n spooner the youngest waters girl run away with a music teacher the court house burned up last march your uncle wiley was elected constable matilda hos kins died from runnin a needle in her hand and tom beedle is courtin sallie lathrop they say he don t miss a night but what he s settin on their porch the wall eyed thing exclaimed miss carring ton with asperity why tom beedle once say you folks excuse me a while this is an old friend of mine mr what was it yes mr summers mr goldstein mr ricketts mr oh what s yours johnny ll do come on over here and tell me some more she swept him to an isolated table in a corner herr goldstein shrugged his fat shoulders and beck oned to the waiter the newspaper man brightened a little and mentioned absinthe the youth with parted hair was plunged into melancholy the guests of the rathskeller laughed clinked glasses and enjoyed the comedy that posie carrington was treat ing them to after her regular performance a few cynical ones whispered press agent and smiled wisely posie carrington laid her dimpled and desirable chin upon her hands and forgot her audience a faculty that had won her laurels for her i don t seem to recollect any bill summers she said thoughtfully gazing straight into the innocent blue eyes of the rustic young man but i know the summerses all right i guess there ain t many changes in the old town you see any of my folks lately and then highsmith played his trump the part of sol haytosser called for pathos as well as comedy miss carrington should see that he could do that as well miss posie said bill summers i was up to your folkeses house jist two or three days ago no there ain t many changes to speak of the lilac bush by the kitchen window is over a foot higher and the elm in the front yard died and had to be cut down and yet it don t seem the same place that it used to be how s ma asked miss carrington she was settin by the front door crocheting a lamp mat when i saw her last said bill she s older n she was miss posie but everything in the house looked jest the same your ma asked me to set down don t touch that willow rocker william says she it ain t been moved since posie left and that s the apron she was hemmin layin over the arm of it jist as she flung it i m in hopes she goes on that posie ll finish runnin out that hem some day miss carrington beckoned peremptorily to a waiter a pint of extra dry she ordered briefly and give the check to goldstein the sun was shinin in the door went on the chronicler from cranberry and your ma was settin right in it i asked her if she hadn t better move back a little william says she when i get sot down and lookin down the road i can t bear to move never a day says she but what i set here every minute that i can spare and watch over them palin s for posie she went away down that road in the night for we seen her little shoe tracks in the dust and somethin tells me she ll come back that way ag in when she s weary of the world and begins to think about her old mother when i was comin away concluded bill i pulled this off n the bush by the front steps i thought maybe i might see you in the city and i knowed you d like somethin from the old home he took from his coat pocket a rose a drooping yellow velvet odorous rose that hung its bead in the foul atmosphere of that tainted rathskeller like a virgin bowing before the hot breath of the lions in a roman arena miss carrington s penetrating but musical laugh rose above the orcbestra s rendering of bluebells oh say she cried with glee ain t those poky places the limit i just know that two hours at cranberry corners would give me the horrors now well i m awful glad to have seen you mr summers guess i ll bustle around to the hotel now and get my beauty sleep she thrust the yellow rose into the bosom of her wonderful dainty silken garments stood up and nodded imperiously at herr goldstein her three companions and bill summers at tended her to her cab when her flounces and streamers were all safely tucked inside she dazzled them with au revoirs from her shining eyes and teeth come around to the hotel and see me bill before you leave the city she called as the glittering cab rolled away highsmith still in his make up went with herr goldstein to a cafe booth bright idea eh asked the smiling actor ought to land sol haytosser for me don t you think the little lady never once tumbled i didn t bear your conversation said goldstein but your make up and acting was k here s to your success you d better call on miss carrington early to morrow and strike her for the part i don t see how she can keep from being satisfied with your exhibition of ability at a m on the next day highsmith hand some dressed in the latest mode confident with a fuchsia in his button bole sent up his card to miss carrington in her select apartment hotel he was shown up and received by the actress s french maid i am sorree said mlle hortense but i am to say this to all it is with great regret mees car rington have cancelled all engagements on the stage and have returned to live in that how you call that town cranberry cornaire the clarion call half of this story can be found in the records of the police department the other half belong behind the business counter of a newspaper office one afternoon two weeks after millionaire nor cross was found in his apartment murdered by a bur glar the murderer while strolling serenely down broadway ran plump against detective barney woods is that you johnny kernan asked woods who had been near sighted in public for five years no less cried kernan heartily if it isn t barney woods late and early of old saint jo you ll have to show me what are you doing east do the green goods circulars get out that far said woods i ve been in new york some years i m on the city detective force well well said kernan breathing smiling joy and patting the detective s arm come into muller s said woods and let s hunt a quiet table i d like to talk to you awhile it lacked a few minutes to the hour of four the tides of trade were not yet loosed and they found a quiet corner of the cafe kernan well dressed slightly swaggering self confident seated himself op posite the little detective with his pale sandy mus tache squinting eyes and ready made cheviot suit what business are you in now asked woods you know you left saint jo a year before i did i m selling shares in a copper mine said ker nan i may establish an office here well well and so old barney is a new york detective you always had a turn that way you were on the po lice in saint jo after i left there weren t you six months said woods and now there s one more question johnny i ve followed your record pretty close ever since you did that hotel job in sara toga and i never knew you to use your gun before why did you kill norcross kernan stared for a few moments with concen trated attention at the slice of lemon in his high ball and then be looked at the detective with a sudden crooked brilliant smile how did you guess it barney he asked ad miringly i swear i thought the job was as clean and as smooth as a peeled onion did i leave a string hanging out anywhere woods laid upon the table a small gold pencil in tended for a watch charm it s the one i gave you the last christmas we were in saint jo i ve got your shaving mug yet i found this under a corner of the rug in norcross s room i warn you to be careful what you say i ve got it put on to you johnny we were old friends once but i must do my duty you ll have to go to the chair for norcross kernan laughed my luck stays with me said be who d have thought old barney was on my trail he slipped one hand inside his coat in an instant woods had a revolver against his side put it away said kernan wrinkling his nose i m only investigating aha it takes nine tailors to make a man but one can do a man up there s a hole in that vest pocket i took that pencil off my chain and slipped it in there in case of a scrap put up your gun barney and i ll tell you why i had to shoot norcross the old fool started down the hall after me popping at the buttons on the back of my coat with a peevish little and i had to stop him the old lady was a darling she just lay in bed and saw her diamond necklace go with out a chirp while she begged like a panhandler to have back a little thin gold ring with a garnet worth about guess she married old norcross for his money all right don t they hang on to the little trinkets from the man who lost out though there were six rings two brooches and a chatelaine watch fifteen thousand would cover the lot i warned you not to talk said woods oh that s all right said kernan the stuff is in my suit case at the hotel and now i ll tell you why i m talking because it s safe i m talking to a man i know you owe me a thousand dollars bar ney woods and even if you wanted to arrest me your hand wouldn t make the move i haven t forgotten said woods you counted out twenty fifties without a word i ll pay it back some day that thousand saved me and well they were piling my furniture out on the sidewalk when i got back to the house and so continued kernan you being barney woods born as true as steel and bound to play a white man s game can t lift a finger to arrest the man you re indebted to oh i have to study men as well as yale locks and window fastenings in my business now keep quiet while i ring for the waiter i ve had a thirst for a year or two that wor ries me a little if i m ever caught the lucky sleuth will have to divide honors with old boy booze but i never drink during business hours after a job i can crook elbows with my old friend barney with a clear conscience what are you taking the waiter came with the little decanters and the siphon and left them alone again you ve called the turn said woods as he rolled the little gold pencil about with a thoughtful fore finger i ve got to pass you up i can t lay a hand on you if i d a paid that money back but i didn t and that settles it it s a bad break i m making johnny but i can t dodge it you helped me once and it calls for the same i knew it said kernan raising his glass with a flushed smile of self appreciation i can judge men here s to barney for he s a jolly good fellow i don t believe went on woods quietly as if be were thinking aloud that if accounts had been square between you and me all the money in all the banks in new york could have bought you out of my hands to night i know it couldn t said kernan that s why i knew i was safe with you most people continued the detective look side ways at my business they don t class it among the fine arts and the professions but i ve always taken a kind of fool pride in it and here is where i go busted i guess i m a man first and a detective afterward i ve got to let you go and then i ve got to resign from the force i guess i can drive an ex press wagon your thousand dollars is further off than ever johnny oh you re welcome to it said kernan with a lordly air i d be willing to call the debt off but i know you wouldn t have it it was a lucky day for me when you borrowed it and now let s drop the subject i m off to the west on a morning train i know a place out there where i can negotiate the norcross sparks drink up barney and forget your troubles we ll have a jolly time while the police are knocking their heads together over the case i ve got one of my sahara thirsts on to night but i m in the bands the unofficial bands of my old friend barney and i won t even dream of a cop and then as kernan s ready finger kept the but ton and the waiter working his weak point a tre mendous vanity and arrogant egotism began to show itself he recounted story after story of his suc cessful plunderings ingenious plots and infamous transgressions until woods with all his familiarity with evil doers felt growing within him a cold ab horrence toward the utterly vicious man who had once been his benefactor i m disposed of of course said woods at length but i advise you to keep under cover for a spell the newspapers may take up this norcross affair there has been an epidemic of burglaries and manslaughter in town this summer the word sent kernan into a high glow of sullen and vindictive rage to hell with the newspapers he growled what do they spell but brag and blow and boodle in box car letters suppose they do take up a case what does it amount to the police are easy enough to fool but what do the newspapers do they send a lot of pin head reporters around to the scene and they make for the nearest saloon and have beer while they take photos of the bartender s oldest daughter in evening dress to print as the fiancee of the young man in the tenth story who thought he heard a noise below on the night of the murder that s about as near as the newspapers ever come to running down mr burglar well i don t know said woods reflecting some of the papers have done good work in that line there s the morning mars for instance it warmed up two or three trails and got the man after the police had let em get cold i ll show you said tiernan rising and expand ing his chest i ll show you what i think of news papers in general and your morning mars in par ticular three feet from their table was the telephone booth kernan went inside and sat at the instrument leaving the door open he found a number in the book took down the receiver and made his demand upon central woods sat still looking at the sneer ing cold vigilant face waiting close to the trans mitter and listened to the words that came from the thin truculent lips curved into a contemptuous smile that the morning mars i want to speak to the managing editor why tell him it s some one who wants to talk to him about the norcross murder you the editor all right i am the man who killed old norcross wait hold the wire i m not the usual crank oh there isn t the slightest danger i ve just been dis cussing it with a detective friend of mine i killed the old man at a m two weeks ago to morrow have a drink with you now hadn t you better leave that kind of talk to your funny man can t you tell whether a man s guying you or whether you re being offered the biggest scoop your dull dishrag of a paper ever had well that s so it s a bobtail scoop but you can hardly expect me to phone in my name and address why oh because i beard you make a specialty of solving mysterious crimes that stump the police no that s not all i want to tell you that your rotten lying penny sheet is of no more use in tracking an intelligent murderer or highway man than a blind poodle would be what oh no this isn t a rival newspaper office you re getting it straight i did the norcross job and i ve got the jewels in my suit case at the name of the hotel could not be learned you recog nize that phrase don t you i thought so you ve used it often enough kind of rattles you doesn t it to have the mysterious villain call up your great big all powerful organ of right and justice and good government and tell you what a helpless old gas bag you are cut that out you re not that big a fool no you don t think i m a fraud i can tell it by your voice now listen and i ll give you a pointer that will prove it to you of course you ve had this murder case worked over by your staff of bright young blockheads half of the second but ton on old mrs norcross s nightgown is broken off i saw it when i took the garnet ring off her finger i thought it was a ruby stop that it won t work kernan turned to woods with a diabolic smile i ve got him going he believes me now he didn t quite cover the transmitter with his hand when he told somebody to call up central on another phone and get our number i ll give him just one more dig and then we ll make a get away hello yes i m here yet you didn t think i d run from such a little subsidized turn coat rag of a newspaper did you have me inside of forty eight hours say will you quit being funny now you let grown men alone and at tend to your business of hunting up divorce cases and street car accidents and printing the filth and scandal that you make your living by good by old boy sorry i haven t time to call on you i d feel perfectly safe in your sanctum asinorum tra la he s as mad as a cat that s lost a mouse said kernan hanging up the receiver and coming out and now barney my boy we ll go to a show and enjoy ourselves until a reasonable bedtime four hours sleep for me and then the west bound the two dined in a broadway restaurant kernan was pleased with himself he spent money like a prince of fiction and then a weird and gorgeous musical comedy engaged their attention afterward there was a late supper in a grillroom with champagne and kernan at the height of his com placency half past three in the morning found them in a corner of an all night cafe kernan still boasting in a vapid and rambling way woods thinking moodily over the end that had come to his usefulness as an upholder of the law but as he pondered his eye brightened with a speculative light i wonder if it s possible be said to himself i won der if it s pos si ble and then outside the cafe the comparative stillness of the early morning was punctured by faint uncer tain cries that seemed mere fireflies of sound some growing louder some fainter waxing and waning amid the rumble of milk wagons and infrequent cars shrill cries they were when near well known cries that conveyed many meanings to the ears of those of the slumbering millions of the great city who waked to hear them cries that bore upon their significant small volume the weight of a world s woe and laugh ter and delight and stress to some cowering be neath the protection of a night s ephemeral cover they brought news of the hideous bright day to others wrapped in happy sleep they announced a morning that would dawn blacker than sable night to many of the rich they brought a besom to sweep away what had been theirs while the stars shone to the poor they brought another day all over the city the cries were starting up keen and sonorous heralding the chances that the slip ping of one cogwheel in the machinery of time had made apportioning to the sleepers while they lay at the mercy of fate the vengeance profit grief reward and doom that the new figure in the calen dar had brought them shrill and yet plaintive were the cries as if the young voices grieved that so much evil and so little good was in their irresponsible hands thus echoed in the streets of the helpless city the transmission of the latest decrees of the gods the cries of the newsboys the clarion call of the press woods flipped a dime to the waiter and said get me a morning mars when the paper came he glanced at its first page and then tore a leaf out of his memorandum book and began to write on it with the little old pencil what s the news yawned kernan woods flipped over to him the piece of writing the new york morning mars please pay to the order of john kernan the one thousand dollars reward coming to me for his arrest and conviction barnard woods i kind of thought they would do that said woods when you were jollying them so hard now johnny you ll come to the police station with me extradited from bohemia from near the village of harmony at the foot of the green mountains came miss medora martin to new york with her color box and easel miss medora resembled the rose which the autum nal frosts had spared the longest of all her sister blossoms in harmony when she started alone to the wicked city to study art they said she was a mad reckless headstrong girl in new york when she first took her seat at a west side boardinghouse table the boarders asked who is the nice looking old maid medora took heart a cheap hall bedroom and two art lessons a week from professor angelini a retired barber who had studied his profession in a harlem dancing academy there was no one to set her right for here in the big city they do it unto all of us how many of us are badly shaved daily and taught the two step imperfectly by ex pupils of bastien le page and gerome the most pathetic sight in new york except the manners of the rush hour crowds is the dreary march of the hopeless army of me diocrity here art is no benignant goddess but a circe who turns her wooers into mewing toms and tabbies who linger about the doorsteps of her abode unmindful of the flying brickbats and boot jacks of the critics some of us creep back to our native vil lages to the skim milk of i told you so but most of us prefer to remain in the cold courtyard of our mistress s temple snatching the scraps that fall from her divine table d hote but some of us grow weary at last of the fruitless service and then there are two fates open to us we can get a job driving a grocer s wagon or we can get swallowed up in the vortex of bohemia the latter sounds good but the former really pans out better for when the grocer pays us off we can rent a dress suit and the cap italized system of humor describes it best get bo hemia on the run miss medora chose the vortex and thereby fur nishes us with our little story professor angelini praised her sketches excessively once when she had made a neat study of a horse chestnut tree in the park he declared she would be come a second rosa bonheur again a great art ist has his moods he would say cruel and cutting things for example medora had spent an after noon patiently sketching the statue and the archi tecture at columbus circle tossing it aside with a sneer the professor informed her that giotto had once drawn a perfect circle with one sweep of his hand one day it rained the weekly remittance from har mony was overdue medora had a headache the pro fessor had tried to borrow two dollars from her her art dealer had sent back all her water colors unsold and mr binkley asked her out to dinner mr binkley was the gay boy of the boarding house he was forty nine and owned a fishstall in a downtown market but after six o clock he wore an evening suit and whooped things up connected with the beaux arts the young men said he was an indian he was supposed to be an accomplished habitue of the inner circles of bohemia it was no secret that he had once loaned to a young man who had had a drawing printed in puck often has one thus obtained his entree into the charmed circle while the other obtained both his entree and roast the other boarders enviously regarded medora as she left at mr binkley s side at nine o clock she was as sweet as a cluster of dried autumn grasses in her pale blue oh er that very thin stuff in her pale blue comstockized silk waist and box pleated voile skirt with a soft pink glow on her thin cheeks and the tiniest bit of rouge powder on her face with her handkerchief and room key in her brown walrus pebble grain band bag and mr binkley looked imposing and dashing with his red face and gray mustache and his tight dress coat that made the back of his neck roll up just like a successful novelist s they drove in a cab to the cafe terence just off the most glittering part of broadway which as every one knows is one of the most popular and widely patronized jealously exclusive bohemian re sorts in the city down between the rows of little tables tripped medora of the green mountains after her escort thrice in a lifetime may woman walk upon clouds once when she trippeth to the altar once when she first enters bohemian halls the last when she marches back across her first garden with the dead hen of her neighbor in her band there was a table set with three or four about it a waiter buzzed around it like a bee and silver and glass shone upon it and preliminary to the meal as the prehistoric granite strata heralded the pro tozoa the bread of gaul compounded after the for mula of the recipe for the eternal bills was there set forth to the hand and tooth of a long suffering city while the gods lay beside their nectar and home made biscuits and smiled and the dentists leaped for joy in their gold leafy dens the eye of binkley fixed a young man at his table with the bobemian gleam which is a compound of the look of the basilisk the shine of a bubble of wurzburger the inspiration of genius and the plead ing of a panhandler the young man sprang to his feet hello bink old boy be shouted don t tell me you were go ing to pass our table join us unless you ve an other crowd on hand don t mind old chap said binkley of the fish stall you know how i like to butt up against the fine arts mr vandyke mr madder er miss martin one of the elect also in art er the introduction went around there were also miss elise and miss toinette perhaps they were models for they chattered of the st regis decora tions and henry james and they did it not badly medora sat in transport music wild intoxi eating music made by troubadours direct from a rear basement room in elysium set her thoughts to dancing here was a world never before penetrated by her warmest imagination or any of the lines con trolled by harriman with the green mountains external calm upon her she sat her soul flaming in her with the fire of andalusia the tables were filled with bohemia the room was full of the fragrance of flowers both mille and cauli questions and corks popped laughter and silver rang champagne flashed in the pail wit flashed in the pan vandyke ruffled his long black locks disarranged his careless tie and leaned over to madder say maddy he whispered feelingly some times i m tempted to pay this philistine his ten dol lars and get rid of him madder ruffled his long sandy locks and disar ranged his careless tie don t think of it vandy he replied we are short and art is long medora ate strange viands and drank elderberry wine that they poured in her glass it was just the color of that in the vermont home the waiter poured something in another glass that seemed to be boiling but when she tasted it it was not hot she had never felt so light hearted before she thought lovingly of the green mountain farm and its fauna she leaned smiling to miss elise if i were at home she said beamingly i could show you the cutest little calf nothing for you in the white lane said miss elise why don t you pad the orchestra played a wailing waltz that medora had learned from the hand organs she followed the air with nodding head in a sweet soprano hum madder looked across the table at her and wondered in what strange waters binkley had caught her in his seine she smiled at him and they raised glasses and drank of the wine that boiled when it was cold binkley had abandoned art and was prating of the unusual spring catch of shad miss elise arranged the palette and maul stick tie pin of mr vandyke a philistine at some distant table was maundering volubly either about jerome or gerome a famous actress was discoursing excitably about monogrammed hosiery a hose clerk from a department store was loudly proclaiming his opinions of the drama a writer was abusing dickens a magazine editor and a photographer were drinking a dry brand at a re served table a young lady was saying to an eminent sculptor fudge for your prax italys bring one of your venus anno dominis down to cohen s and see bow quick she d be turned down for a cloak model back to the quarries with your greeks and dagos thus went bohemia at eleven mr binkley took medora to the board ing bouse and left her with a society bow at the foot of the hall stairs she went up to her room and lit the gas and then as suddenly as the dreadful genie arose in vapor from the copper vase of the fisherman arose in that room the formidable shape of the new england conscience the terrible thing that medora had done was revealed to her in its full enormity she had sat in the presence of the un godly and looked upon the wine both when it was red and effervescent at midnight she wrote this letter mr berlah hoskins harmony vermont dear sir henceforth consider me as dead to you forever i have loved you too well to blight your career by bringing into it my guilty and sin stained life i have succumbed to the insidious wiles of this wicked world and have been drawn into the vortex of bohemia there is scarcely any depth of glittering iniquity that i have not sounded it is hopeless to combat my decision there is no rising from the depths to which i have sunk endeavor to forget me i am lost forever in the fair but brutal maze of awful bohemia farewell once your medora on the next day medora formed her resolutions beelzebub flung from heaven was no more cast down between her and the apple blossoms of harmony there was a fixed gulf flaming cherubim warded her from the gates of her lost paradise in one evening by the aid of binkley and mumm bohemia had gathered her into its awful midst there remained to her but one thing a life of brilliant but irremediable error vermont was a shrine that she never would dare to approach again but she would not sink there were great and com pelling ones in history upon whom she would model her meteoric career camille lola montez royal mary zaza such a name as one of these would that of medora martin be to future generations for two days medora kept her room on the third she opened a magazine at the portrait of the king of belgium and laughed sardonically if that far famed breaker of women s hearts should cross her path he would have to bow before her cold and im perious beauty she would not spare the old or the young all america all europe should do homage to her sinister but compelling charm as yet she could not bear to think of the life she had once desired a peaceful one in the shadow of the green mountains with beriah at her side and orders for expensive oil paintings coming in by each mail from new york her one fatal misstep had shattered that dream on the fourth day medora powdered her face and rouged her lips once she had seen carter in zaza she stood before the mirror in a reckless attitude and cried zut zut she rhymed it with nut but with the lawless word harmony seemed to pass away forever the vortex had her she belonged to bohemia for evermore and never would beriah the door opened and beriah walked in dory said he what s all that chalk and pink stuff on your face honey medora extended an arm too late she said solemnly the die is cast i belong in another world curse me if you will it is your right go and leave me in the path i have chosen bid them all at home never to men tion my name again and sometimes beriah pray for me when i am revelling in the gaudy but hol low pleasures of bohemia get a towel dory said beriah and wipe that paint off your face i came as soon as i got your letter them pictures of yours ain t amount ing to anything i ve got tickets for both of us back on the evening train hurry and get your things in your trunk fate was too strong for me beriah go while i am strong to bear it how do you fold this easel dory now begin to pack so we have time to eat before train time the maples is all out in full grown leaves dory you just ought to see em not this early beriah you ought to see em dory they re like an ocean of green in the morning sunlight oh beriah on the train she said to him suddenly i wonder why you came when you got my let ter oh shucks said beriah did you think you could fool me how could you be run away to that bohemia country like you said when your letter was postmarked new york as plain as day a philistine in bohemia george washington with his right arm upraised sits his iron horse at the lower corner of union square

unless his nerves are iron that rapid tran sit gloria mundi should the general raise his left hand as he has raised his right it would point to a quarter of the city that forms a haven for the

waiter who serves your table d hote for the other half perhaps if the barber shops had tongues and who will dispute it they could tell their share titles are as plentiful as finger rings among these

who en tertain these offshoots of nobility are not dazzled by coronets and crests they have doughnuts to sell instead of daughters with them it is a serious matter of trading in flour and sugar instead of pearl powder and bonbons these assertions are deemed fitting as an introduction to the tale which is of plebeians and contains no one with even the ghost of a title katy dempsey s mother kept a furnished room house in this oasis of the aliens the business was not profitable if the two scraped together enough to meet the landlord s agent on rent day and nego tiate for the ingredients of a daily irish stew they called it success often the stew lacked both meat and potatoes sometimes it became as bad as consomme with music in this mouldy old house katy waxed plump and pert and wholesome and as beautiful and freckled as a tiger lily she was the good fairy who was guilty of placing the damp clean towels and cracked pitchers of freshly laundered croton in the lodgers rooms you are informed by virtue of the privileges of astronomical discovery that the star lodger s name was mr brunelli his wearing a yellow tie and pay ing his rent promptly distinguished him from the other lodgers his raiment was splendid his com plexion olive his mustache fierce his manners a prince s his rings and pins as magnificent as those of a traveling dentist he had breakfast served in his room and he ate it in a red dressing gown with green tassels he left the house at noon and returned at midnight those were mysterious hours but there was nothing my terious about mrs dempsey s lodgers except the things that were not mysterious one of mr kip ling s poems is addressed to ye who hold the un written clue to all save all unwritten thing the same readers are invited to tackle the foregoing assertion mr brunelli being impressionable and a latin fell to conjugating the verb amare with katy in the objective case though not because of antipathy she talked it over with her mother

his grandfather s chat taw as security for tin weeks rint mr brunelli continued his calorific wooing katy continued to hesitate one day he asked her out to dine and she felt that a denouement was in the air while they are on their way with katy in her best muslin you must take as an entr acte a brief peep at new york s bohemia tonio s restaurant is in bohemia the very lo cation of it is secret if you wish to know where it is ask the first person you meet he will tell you in a whisper tonio discountenances custom he keeps his house front black and forbidding he gives you a pretty bad dinner he locks his door at the dining hour but he knows spaghetti as the boarding house knows cold veal and he has deposited many dol lars in a certain banco di something with many gold vowels in the name on its windows to this restaurant mr brunelli conducted katy the house was dark and the shades were lowered but mr brunelli touched an electric button by the base ment door and they were admitted along a long dark narrow hallway they went and then through a shining and spotless kitchen that opened directly upon a back yard the walls of houses hemmed three sides of the yard a high board fence surrounded by cats the other a wash of clothes was suspended high upon a line stretched from diagonal corners those were property clothes and were never taken in by tonio they were there that wits with defective pronuncia tion might make puns in connection with the ragout a dozen and a half little tables set upon the bare ground were crowded with bohemia hunters who flocked there because tonio pretended not to want them and pretended to give them a good dinner there was a sprinkling of real bohemians present who came for a change because they were tired of the real bohemia and a smart shower of the men who originate the bright sayings of congressmen and the little nephew of the well known general passen ger agent of the evansville and terre haute rail road company here is a bon mot that was manufactured at tonio s a dinner at tonio s said a bohemian always amounts to twice the price that is asked for it let us assume that an accommodating voice in quires how so the dinner costs you cents you give cents to the waiter and it makes you feel like cents most of the diners were confirmed table d hoters gastronomic adventuress forever seeking the el do rado of a good claret and consistently coming to grief in california mr brunelli escorted katy to a little table em bowered with shrubbery in tubs and asked her to excuse him for a while katy sat enchanted by a scene so brilliant to her the grand ladies in splendid dresses and plumes and sparkling rings the fine gentlemen who laughed so loudly the cries of garsong and we mon seer and hello mame that distinguish bo hemia the lively chatter the cigarette smoke the interchange of bright smiles and eye glances all this display and magnificence overpowered the daugh ter of mrs dempsey and held her motionless mr brunelli stepped into the yard and seemed to spread his smile and bow over the entire company and everywhere there was a great clapping of bands and a few cries of bravo and tonio tonio whatever those words might mean ladies waved their napkins at him gentlemen almost twisted their necks off trying to catch his nod when the ovation was concluded mr brunelli with a final bow stepped nimbly into the kitchen and flung off his coat and waistcoat flaherty the nimblest garsong among the waiters had been assigned to the special service of katy she was a little faint from hunger for the irish stew on the dempsey table had been particu larly weak that day delicious odors from unknown dishes tantalized her and flaherty began to bring to her table course after course of ambrosial food that the gods might have pronounced excellent but even in the midst of her lucullian repast katy laid down her knife and fork her heart sank as lead and a tear fell upon her filet mignon her haunting suspicions of the star lodger arose again fourfold thus courted and admired and smiled upon by that fashionable and gracious assembly what else could mr brunelli be but one of those dazzling titled patricians glorious of name but shy of rent money concerning whom experience had made her wise with a sense of his ineligibility growing within her there was mingled a torturing conviction that his personality was becoming more pleasing to her day by day and why had he left her to dine alone but here he was coming again now coatless his snowy shirt sleeves rolled high above his jeffries onian elbows a white yachting cap perched upon his jetty curls tonio tonio shouted many and the spaghetti the spaghetti shouted the rest never at tonio s did a waiter dare to serve a dish of spaghetti until tonio came to test it to prove the sauce and add the needful dash of seasoning that gave it perfection from table to table moved tonio like a prince in his palace greeting his guests white jewelled bands signalled him from every side a glass of wine with this one and that smiles for all a jest and repartee for any that might challenge truly few princes could be so agreeable a host and what artist could ask for further appreciation of his handiwork katy did not know that the proudest consummation of a new yorker s ambition is to shake bands with a spaghetti chef or to receive a nod from a broadway head waiter at last the company thinned leaving but a few couples and quartettes lingering over new wine and old stories and then came mr brunelli to katy s secluded table and drew a chair close to hers katy smiled at him dreamily she was eating the last spoonful of a raspberry roll with burgundy sauce you have seen said mr brunelli laying one hand upon his collar bone i am antonio brunelli yes i am the great tonio you have not suspect that i loave you katy and you shall marry with me is it not so call me antonio and say that you will be mine katy s head drooped to the shoulder that was now freed from all suspicion of having received the knightly accolade oh andy she sighed this is great sure i ll marry wid ye but why didn t ye tell me ye was the cook i was near turnin ye down for bein one of thim foreign counts from each according to his ability vuyning left his club cursing it softly without any particular anger from ten in the morning un til eleven it had bored him immeasurably kirk with his fish story brooks with his porto rico cigars old morrison with his anecdote about the widow hep burn with his invariable luck at billiards all these afflictions had been repeated without change of bill or scenery besides these morning evils miss allison had refused him again on the night before but that was a chronic trouble five times she had laughed at his offer to make her mrs vuyning he intended to ask her again the next wednesday evening vuyning walked along forty fourth street to broadway and then drifted down the great sluice that washes out the dust of the gold mines of gotham he wore a morning suit of light gray low dull kid shoes a plain finely woven straw hat and his visible linen was the most delicate possible shade of heliotrope his necktie was the blue gray of a november sky and its knot was plainly the outcome of a lordly carelessness combined with an accurate conception of the most recent dictum of fashion now to write of a man s haberdashery is a worse thing than to write a historical novel around paul jones or to pen a testimonial to a hay fever cure therefore let it be known that the description of vuyning s apparel is germane to the movements of the story and not to make room for the new fall stock of goods even broadway that morning was a discord in vuyning s ears and in his eyes it paralleled for a few dreamy dreary minutes a certain howling scorching seething malodorous slice of street that he remembered in morocco he saw the struggling mass of dogs beggars fakirs slave drivers and veiled women in carts without horses the sun blazing brightly among the bazaars the piles of rubbish from ruined temples in the street and then a lady passing jabbed the ferrule of a parasol in his side and brought him back to broadway five minutes of his stroll brought him to a certain corner where a number of silent pale faced men are accustomed to stand immovably for hours busy with the file blades of their penknives with their hat brims on a level with their eyelids wall street speculators driving home in their carriages love to point out these men to their visiting friends and tell them of this rather famous lounging place of the crooks on wall street the speculators never use the file blades of their knives vuyning was delighted when one of this company stepped forth and addressed him as he was passing he was hungry for something out of the ordinary and to be accosted by this smooth faced keen eyed low voiced athletic member of the under world with his grim yet pleasant smile had all the taste of an adventure to the convention weary vuyning excuse me friend said be could i have a few minutes talk with you on the level certainly said vuyning with a smile but suppose we step aside to a quieter place there is a divan a cafe over here that will do schrumm will give us a private corner schrumm established them under a growing palm with two seidls between them vuyning made a pleasant reference to meteorological conditions thus forming a binge upon which might be swung the door leading from the thought repository of the other in the first place said his companion with the air of one who presents his credentials i want you to understand that i am a crook out west i am known as rowdy the dude pickpocket supper man second story man yeggman boxman all round bur glar cardsharp and slickest con man west of the twenty third street ferry landing that s my his tory that s to show i m on the square with you my name s emerson confound old kirk with his fish stories said vuyning to himself with silent glee as he went through his pockets for a card it s pronounced vining he said as he tossed it over to the other and i ll be as frank with you i m just a kind of a loafer i guess living on my daddy s money at the club they call me left at the post i never did a day s work in my life and i haven t the heart to run over a chicken when i m motoring it s a pretty shabby record altogether there s one thing you can do said emerson admiringly you can carry duds i ve watched you several times pass on broadway you look the best dressed man i ve seen and i ll bet you a gold mine i ve got worth more gent s furnishings on my frame than you have that s what i wanted to see you about i can t do the trick take a look at me what s wrong stand up said vuyning emerson arose and slowly revolved you ve been outfitted declared the clubman some broadway window dresser has misused you that s an expensive suit though emerson a hundred dollars said emerson twenty too much said vuyning six months old in cut one inch too long and half an inch to much lapel your hat is plainly dated one year ago although there s only a sixteenth of an inch lacking in the brim to tell the story that english poke in your collar is too short by the distance between troy and london a plain gold link cuff button would take all the shine out of those pearl ones with dia mond settings those tan shoes would be exactly the articles to work into the heart of a brooklyn school ma am on a two weeks visit to lake ronkon koma i think i caught a glimpse of a blue silk sock embroidered with russet lilies of the valley when you improperly drew up your trousers as you sat down there are always plain ones to be had in the stores have i hurt your feelings emer son double the ante cried the criticised one greed ily give me more of it there s a way to tote the haberdashery and i want to get wise to it say you re the right kind of a swell anything else to the queer about me your tie said vuyning is tied with absolute precision and correctness thanks gratefully i spent over half an hour at it before i thereby interrupted vuyning completing your resemblance to a dummy in a broadway store window yours truly said emerson sitting down again it s bully of you to put me wise i knew there was something wrong but i couldn t just put my finger on it i guess it comes by nature to know how to wear clothes oh i suppose said vuyning with a laugh that my ancestors picked up the knack while they were peddling clothes from house to house a couple of hundred years ago i m told they did that and mine said emerson cheerfully were making their visits at night i guess and didn t have a chance to catch on to the correct styles i tell you what said vuyning whose ennui had taken wings i ll take you to my tailor he ll eliminate the mark of the beast from your exterior that is if you care to go any further in the way of expense play em to the ceiling said emerson with a boyish smile of joy i ve got a roll as big around as a barrel of black eyed peas and as loose as the wrapper of a two for fiver i don t mind telling you that i was not touring among the antipodes when the burglar proof safe of the farmers national bank of butterville ia flew open some moonless nights ago to the tune of aren t you afraid asked vuyning that i ll call a cop and hand you over you tell me said emerson coolly why i didn t keep them he laid vuyning s pocketbook and watch the vuyning year old family watch on the table man said vuyning revelling did you ever hear the tale kirk tells about the six pound trout and the old fisherman seems not said emerson politely i d like to but you won t said vuyning i ve heard it scores of times that s why i won t tell you i was just thinking how much better this is than a club now shall we go to my tailor boys and elderly gents said vuyning five days later at his club standing up against the window where his coterie was gathered and keeping out the breeze a friend of mine from the west will dine at our table this evening will he ask if we have heard the latest from denver said a member squirming in his chair will he mention the new twenty three story ma sonic temple in quincy ill inquired another dropping his nose glasses will he spring one of those western mississippi river catfish stories in which they use yearling calves for bait demanded kirk fiercely be comforted said vuyning he has none of the little vices he is a burglar and safe blower and a pal of mine oh mary ann said they must you always adorn every statement with your alleged humor it came to pass that at eight in the evening a calm smooth brilliant affable man sat at vuyning s right hand during dinner and when the ones who pass their lives in city streets spoke of skyscrapers or of the little czar on his far frozen throne or of insig nificant fish from inconsequential streams this big deep chested man faultlessly clothed and eyed like an emperor disposed of their lilliputian chatter with a wink of his eyelash and then he painted for them with hard broad strokes a marvellous lingual panorama of the west he stacked snow topped mountains on the table freezing the hot dishes of the waiting diners with a wave of his hand he swept the clubhouse into a pine crowned gorge turning the waiters into a grim posse and each listener into a blood stained fugitive climbing with torn fingers upon the ensanguined rocks he touched the table and spake and the five panted as they gazed on barren lava beds and each man took his tongue between his teeth and felt his mouth bake at the tale of a land empty of water and food as simply as homer sang while he dug a tine of his fork leisurely into the tablecloth he opened a new world to their view as does one who tells a child of the looking glass country as one of his listeners might have spoken of tea too strong at a madison square afternoon so he depicted the ravages of redeye in a border town when the caballeros of the lariat and forty five reduced ennui to a minimum and then with a sweep of his white unringed hands be dismissed melpomene and forthwith diana and amaryllis footed it before the mind s eyes of the clubmen the savannas of the continent spread before them the wind humming through a hundred leagues of sage brush and mesquite closed their ears to the city s staccato noises he told them of camps of ranches marooned in a sea of fragrant prairie blos soms of gallops in the stilly night that apollo would have forsaken his daytime steeds to enjoy he read them the great rough epic of the cattle and the hills that have not been spoiled by the band of man the mason his words were a telescope to the city men whose eyes had looked upon youngstown o and whose tongues had called it west in fact emerson had them going the next morning at ten he met vuyning by ap pointment at a forty second street cafe emerson was to leave for the west that day he wore a suit of dark cheviot that looked to have been draped upon him by an ancient grecian tailor who was a few thousand years ahead of the styles mr vuyning said he with the clear ingenuous smile of the successful crook it s up to me to go the limit for you any time i can do so you re the real thing and if i can ever return the favor you bet your life i ll do it what was that cow puncher s name asked vuyning who used to catch a mustang by the nose and mane and throw him till he put the bridle on bates said emerson thanks said vuyning i thought it was yates oh about that toggery business i d for gotten that i ve been looking for some guy to put me on the right track for years said emerson you re the goods duty free and half way to the warehouse in a red wagon bacon toasted on a green willow switch over red coals ought to put broiled lobsters out of business said vuyning and you say a horse at the end of a thirty foot rope can t pull a ten inch stake out of wet prairie well good bye old man if you must be off at one o clock vuyning had luncheon with miss allison by previous arrangement for thirty minutes be babbled to her unaccount ably of ranches horses cations cyclones round ups rocky mountains and beans and bacon she looked at him with wondering and half terrified eyes i was going to propose again to day said vuy ning cheerily but i won t i ve worried you often enough you know dad has a ranch in colorado what s the good of staying here jumping jon quils but it s great out there i m going to start next tuesday no you won t said miss allison what said vuyning not alone said miss allison dropping a tear upon her salad what do you think betty exclaimed vuyning what do you mean i ll go too said miss allison forcibly vuyning filled her glass with apollinaris here s to rowdy the dude he gave a toast mysterious don t know him said miss allison but if he s your friend jimmy here goes the memento miss lynnette d armande turned her back on broadway this was but tit for tat be cause broadway had often done the same thing to miss d armande still the tats seemed to have it for the ex leading lady of the reaping the whirlwind company had everything to ask of broadway while there was no vice versa so miss lynnette d armande turned the back of her chair to her window that overlooked broadway and sat down to stitch in time the lisle thread heel of a black silk stocking the tumult and glitter of the roaring broadway beneath her window had no charm for her what she greatly desired was the stifling air of a dressing room on that fairyland street and the roar of an audience gathered in that capricious quarter in the meantime those stock ings must not be neglected silk does wear out so but after all isn t it just the only goods there is the hotel thalia looks on broadway as marathon looks on the sea it stands like a gloomy cliff above the whirlpool where the tides of two great thorough fares clash here the player bands gather at the end of their wanderings to loosen the buskin and dust the sock thick in the streets around it are booking offices theatres agents schools and the lobster pal aces to which those thorny paths lead wandering through the eccentric halls of the dim and fusty thalia you seem to have found yourself in some great ark or caravan about to sail or fly or roll away on wheels about the house lingers a sense of unrest of expectation of transientness even of anxiety and apprehension the halls are a labyrinth without a guide you wander like a lost soul in a sam loyd puzzle turning any corner a dressing sack or a cul de sac may bring you up short you meet alarming tragedians stalking in bath robes in search of ru mored bathrooms from hundreds of rooms come the buzz of talk scraps of new and old songs and the ready laughter of the convened players summer has come their companies have disbanded and they take their rest in their favorite caravansary while they besiege the managers for engagements for the coming season at this hour of the afternoon the day s work of tramping the rounds of the agents offices is over past you as you ramble distractedly through the mossy halls flit audible visions of houris with veiled starry eyes flying tag ends of things and a swish of silk bequeathing to the dull hallways an odor of gaiety and a memory of frangipanni serious young comedians with versatile adam s apples gather in doorways and talk of booth far reaching from somewhere comes the smell of ham and red cabbage and the crash of dishes on the american plan the indeterminate hum of life in the thalia is enlivened by the discreet popping at reasonable and salubrious intervals of beer bottle corks thus punctuated life in the genial hostel scans easily the comma being the favorite mark semicolons frowned upon and periods barred miss d armannde s room was a small one there was room for her rocker between the dresser and the wash stand if it were placed longitudinally on the dresser were its usual accoutrements plus the ex lead ing lady s collected souvenirs of road engagements and photographs of her dearest and best professional friends at one of these photographs she looked twice or thrice as she darned and smiled friendlily i d like to know where lee is just this minute she said half aloud if you had been privileged to view the photograph thus flattered you would have thought at the first glance that you saw the picture of a many petalled white flower blown through the air by a storm but the floral kingdom was not responsible for that swirl of petalous whiteness you saw the filmy brief skirt of miss rosalie ray as she made a complete heels over head turn in her wistaria entwined swing far out from the stage high above the heads of the audience you saw the cam era s inadequate representation of the graceful strong kick with which she at this exciting moment sent flying high and far the yellow silk garter that each evening spun from her agile limb and descended upon the delighted audience below you saw too amid the black clothed mainly mas culine patrons of select vaudeville a hundred hands raised with the hope of staying the flight of the bril liant aerial token forty weeks of the best circuits this act had brought miss rosalie ray for each of two years she did other things during her twelve minutes a song and dance imitations of two or three actors who are but imitations of themselves and a balancing feat with a step ladder and feather duster but when the blossom decked swing was let down from the flies and miss rosalie sprang smiling into the seat with the golden circlet conspicuous in the place whence it was soon to slide and become a soaring and coveted guerdon then it was that the audience rose in its seat as a single man or presumably so and in dorsed the specialty that made miss ray s name a favorite in the booking offices at the end of the two years miss ray suddenly an nounced to her dear friend miss d armande that she was going to spend the summer at an antediluvian village on the north shore of long island and that the stage would see her no more seventeen minutes after miss lynnette d armande had expressed her wish to know the whereabouts of her old chum there were sharp raps at her door doubt not that it was rosalie ray at the shrill command to enter she did so with something of a tired flutter and dropped a heavy hand bag on the floor upon my word it was rosalie in a loose travel stained automobileless coat closely tied brown veil with yard long flying ends gray walking suit and tan oxfords with lavender overgaiters when she threw off her veil and hat you saw a pretty enough face now flushed and disturbed by some unusual emotion and restless large eyes with discontent marring their brightness a heavy pile of dull auburn hair hastily put up was escaping in crinkly waving strands and curling small locks from the confining combs and pins the meeting of the two was not marked by the effusion vocal gymnastical osculatory and catecheti cal that distinguishes the greetings of their unpro fessional sisters in society there was a brief clinch two simultaneous labial dabs and they stood on the same footing of the old days very much like the short salutations of soldiers or of travellers in for eign wilds are the welcomes between the strollers at the corners of their crisscross roads i ve got the hall room two flights up above yours said rosalie but i came straight to see you before going up i didn t know you were here till they told me i ve been in since the last of april said lyn nette and i m going on the road with a fatal inheritance company we open next week in eliz abeth i thought you d quit the stage lee tell me about yourself rosalie settled herself with a skilful wriggle on the top of miss d armande s wardrobe trunk and leaned her head against the papered wall from long habit thus can peripatetic leading ladies and their sisters make themselves as comfort able as though the deepest armchairs embraced them i m going to tell you lynn she said with a strangely sardonic and yet carelessly resigned look on her youthful face and then to morrow i ll strike the old broadway trail again and wear some more paint off the chairs in the agents offices if anybody had told me any time in the last three months up to four o clock this afternoon that i d ever listen to that leave your name and address rot of the booking bunch again i d have given em the real mrs fiske laugh loan me a handkerchief lynn gee but those long island trains are fierce i ve got enough soft coal cinders on my face to go on and play topsy without using the cork and speaking of corks got anything to drink lynn miss d armande opened a door of the wash stand and took out a bottle there s nearly a pint of manhattan there s a cluster of carnations in the drinking glass but oh pass the bottle save the glass for com pany thanks that hits the spot the same to you my first drink in three months yes lynn i quit the stage at the end of last season i quit it because i was sick of the life and especially because my heart and soul were sick of men of the kind of men we stage people have to be up against you know what the game is to us it s a fight against em all the way down the line from the manager who wants us to try his new motor car to the bill posters who want to call us by our front names and the men we have to meet after the show are the worst of all the stage door kind and the man ager s friends who take us to supper and show their diamonds and talk about seeing dan and dave and charlie for us they re beasts and i hate em i tell you lynn it s the girls like us on the stage that ought to be pitied it s girls from good homes that are honestly ambitious and work hard to rise in the profession but never do get there you bear a lot of sympathy sloshed around on chorus girls and their fifteen dollars a week piffle there ain t a sorrow in the chorus that a lobster cannot heal if there s any tears to shed let em fall for the actress that gets a salary of from thirty to forty five dollars a week for taking a leading part in a bum show she knows she ll never do any better but she hangs on for years hoping for the chance i that never comes and the fool plays we have to work in having another girl roll you around the stage by the hind legs in a wheelbarrow chorus in a musical comedy is dignified drama compared with the idiotic things i ve had to do in the thirty centers but what i hated most was the men the men leering and blathering at you across tables trying to buy you with wurzburger or extra dry accord ing to their estimate of your price and the men in the audiences clapping yelling snarling crowding writhing gloating like a lot of wild beasts with their eyes fixed on you ready to eat you up if you come in reach of their claws oh how i hate em well i m not telling you much about myself am i lynn i had two hundred dollars saved up and i cut the stage the first of the summer i went over on long island and found the sweetest little village that ever was called soundport right on the water i was going to spend the summer there and study up on elocution and try to get a class in the fall there was an old widow lady with a cottage near the beach who sometimes rented a room or two just for com pany and she took me in she had another boarder too the reverend arthur lyle yes he was the head liner you re on lynn i ll tell you all of it in a minute it s only a one act play the first time he walked on lynn i felt myself going the first lines he spoke he had me he was different from the men in audiences he was tall and slim and you never heard him come in the room but you felt him he had a face like a picture of a knight like one of that round table bunch and a voice like a cello solo and his manners lynn if you d take john drew in his best draw ing room scene and compare the two you d have john arrested for disturbing the peace i ll spare you the particulars but in less than a month arthur and i were engaged he preached at a little one night stand of a methodist church there was to be a parsonage the size of a lunch wagon and hens and honeysuckles when we were married ar thur used to preach to me a good deal about heaven but be never could get my mind quite off those honey suckles and hens no i didn t tell him i d been on the stage i hated the business and all that went with it i d cut it out forever and i didn t see any use of stirring things up i was a good girl and i didn t have any thing to confess except being an elocutionist and that was about all the strain my conscience would stand oh i tell you lynn i was happy i sang in the choir and attended the sewing society and re cited that annie laurie thing with the whistling stunt in it in a manner bordering upon the profes sional as the weekly village paper reported it and arthur and i went rowing and walking in the woods and clamming and that poky little village seemed to me the best place in the world i d have been happy to live there always too if but one morning old mrs gurley the widow lady got gossipy while i was helping her string beans on the back porch and began to gush information as folks who rent out their rooms usually do mr lyle was her idea of a saint on earth as he was mine too she went over all his virtues and graces and wound up by telling me that arthur had had an exremely romantic love affair not long before that had ended unhappily she didn t seem to be on to the details but she knew that he had been hit pretty hard he was paler and thinner she said and he had some kind of a remembrance or keepsake of the lady in a little rosewood box that he kept locked in his desk drawer in his study several times says she i ve seen him gloomerin over that box of evenings and he always locks it up right away if anybody comes into the room well you can imagine how long it was before i got arthur by the wrist and led him down stage and hissed in his ear that same afternoon we were lazying around in a boat among the water lilies at the edge of the bay arthur says i you never told me you d had another love affair but mrs gurley did i went on to let him know i knew i hate to bear a man lie before you came says he looking me frankly in the eye there was a previous affection a strong one since you know of it i will be perfectly candid with you i am waiting says i my dear ida says arthur of course i went by my real name while i was in soundport this former affection was a spiritual one in fact al though the lady aroused my deepest sentiments and was as i thought my ideal woman i never met her and never spoke to her it was an ideal love my love for you while no less ideal is different you wouldn t let that come between us was she pretty i asked she was very beautiful said arthur did you see her often i asked something like a dozen times says he always from a distance says i always from quite a distance says he and you loved her i asked she seemed my ideal of beauty and grace and soul says arthur and this keepsake that you keep under lock and key and moon over at times is that a remembrance from her a memento says arthur that i have treasured did she send it to you it came to me from her says be in a roundabout way i asked somewhat roundabout says he and yet rather direct why didn t you ever meet her i asked were your positions in life so different she was far above me says arthur now ida he goes on this is all of the past you re not going to be jealous are you jealous says i why man what are you talking about it makes me think ten times as much of you as i did before i knew about it and it did lynn if you can understand it that ideal love was a new one on me but it struck me as being the most beautiful and glorious thing i d ever heard of think of a man loving a woman he d never even spoken to and being faithful just to what his mind and heart pictured her oh it sounded great to me the men i d always known come at you with either diamonds knock out drops or a raise of salary and their ideals well we ll say no more yes it made me think more of arthur than i did before i couldn t be jealous of that far away divin ity that he used to worship for i was going to have him myself and i began to look upon him as a saint on earth just as old lady gurley did about four o clock this afternoon a man came to the house for arthur to go and see somebody that was sick among his church bunch old lady gurley was taking her afternoon snore on a couch so that left me pretty much alone in passing by arthur s study i looked in and saw his bunch of keys hanging in the drawer of his desk where he d forgotten em well i guess we re all to the mrs bluebeard now and then ain t we lynn i made up my mind i d have a look at that memento he kept so secret not that i cared what it was it was just curiosity while i was opening the drawer i imagined one or two things it might be i thought it might be a dried rosebud she d dropped down to him from a balcony or maybe a picture of her he d cut out of a magazine she being so high up in the world i opened the drawer and there was the rosewood casket about the size of a gent s collar box i found the little key in the bunch that fitted it and unlocked it and raised the lid i took one look at that memento and then i went to my room and packed my trunk i threw a few things into my grip gave my hair a flirt or two with a side comb put on my hat and went in and gave the old lady s foot a kick i d tried awfully hard to use proper and correct language while i was there for arthur s sake and i had the habit down pat but it left me then stop sawing gourds says i and sit up and take notice the ghost s about to walk i m going away from here and i owe you eight dollars the expressman will call for my trunk i handed her the money dear me miss crosby says she is any thing wrong i thought you were pleased here dear me young women are so hard to understand and so different from what you expect em to be you re damn right says i some of em are but you can t say that about men when you know one man you know em all that settles the human race question and then i caught the four thirty eight soft coal unlimited and here i am you didn t tell me what was in the box lee said miss d armande anxiously one of those yellow silk garters that i used to kick off my leg into the audience during that old vaudeville swing act of mine is there any of the cocktail left lynn waifs and strays the red roses of tonia a trestle burned down on the international railroad the south bound from san antonio was cut off for the next forty eight hours on that train was tonia weaver s easter hat espirition the mexican who had been sent forty miles in a buckboard from the espinosa ranch to fetch it returned with a shrugging shoulder and hands empty except for a cigarette at the small station nopal he had learned of the delayed train and having no commands to wait turned his ponies toward the ranch again now if one supposes that easter the goddess of spring cares any more for the after church parade on fifth avenue than she does for her loyal outfit of subjects that assemble at the meeting house at cactus tex a mistake has been made the wives and daughters of the ranchmen of the frio country put forth easter blossoms of new hats and gowns as faithfully as is done anywhere and the southwest is for one day a mingling of prickly pear paris and paradise and now it was good friday and tonia weaver s easter hat blushed unseen in the desert air of an impotent express car beyond the burned trestle on saturday noon the rogers girls from the shoestring ranch and ella reeves from the anchor o and mrs bennet and ida from green valley would convene at the espinosa and pick up tonia with their easter hats and frocks carefully wrapped and bundled against the dust the fair aggregation would then merrily jog the ten miles to cactus where on the morrow they would array themselves subjugate man do homage to easter and cause jealous agitation among the lilies of the field tonia sat on the steps of the espinosa ranch house flicking gloomily with a quirt at a tuft of curly mesquite she displayed a frown and a contumelious lip and endeavored to radiate an aura of disagreeableness and tragedy i hate railroads she announced positively and men men pretend to run them can you give any excuse why a trestle should burn ida bennet s hat is to be trimmed with violets i shall not go one step toward cactus without a new hat if i were a man i would get one two men listened uneasily to this disparagement of their kind one was wells pearson foreman of the mucho calor cattle ranch the other was thompson burrows the prosperous sheepman from the quintana valley both thought tonia weaver adorable especially when she railed at railroads and menaced men either would have given up his epidermis to make for her an easter hat more cheerfully than the ostrich gives up his tip or the aigrette lays down its life neither possessed the ingenuity to conceive a means of supplying the sad deficiency against the coming sabbath pearson s deep brown face and sunburned light hair gave him the appearance of a schoolboy seized by one of youth s profound and insolvable melancholies tonia s plight grieved him through and through thompson burrows was the more skilled and pliable he hailed from somewhere in the east originally and he wore neckties and shoes and was made dumb by woman s presence the big water hole on sandy creek said pearson scarcely hoping to make a hit was filled up by that last rain oh was it said tonia sharply thank you for the information i suppose a new hat is nothing to you mr pearson i suppose you think a woman ought to wear an old stetson five years without a change as you do if your old water hole could have put out the fire on that trestle you might have some reason to talk about it i am deeply sorry said burrows warned by pearson s fate that you failed to receive your hat miss weaver deeply sorry indeed if there was anything i could do don t bother interrupted tonia with sweet sarcasm if there was anything you could do you d be doing it of course there isn t tonia paused a sudden sparkle of hope had come into her eye her frown smoothed away she had an inspiration there s a store over at lone elm crossing on the nueces she said that keeps hats eva rogers got hers there she said it was the latest style it might have some left but it s twenty eight miles to lone elm the spurs of two men who hastily arose jingled and tonia almost smiled the knights then were not all turned to dust nor were their rowels rust of course said tonia looking thoughtfully at a white gulf cloud sailing across the cerulean dome nobody could ride to lone elm and back by the time the girls call by for me to morrow so i reckon i ll have to stay at home this easter sunday and then she smiled well miss tonia said pearson reaching for his hat as guileful as a sleeping babe i reckon i ll be trotting along back to mucho calor there s some cutting out to be done on dry branch first thing in the morning and me and road runner has got to be on hand it s too bad your hat got sidetracked maybe they ll get that trestle mended yet in time for easter i must be riding too miss tonia announced burrows looking at his watch i declare it s nearly five o clock i must be out at my lambing camp in time to help pen those crazy ewes tonia s suitors seemed to have been smitten with a need for haste they bade her a ceremonious farewell and then shook each other s hands with the elaborate and solemn courtesy of the southwesterner hope i ll see you again soon mr pearson said burrows same here said the cowman with the serious face of one whose friend goes upon a whaling voyage be gratified to see you ride over to mucho calor any time you strike that section of the range pearson mounted road runner the soundest cow pony on the frio and let him pitch for a minute as he always did on being mounted even at the end of a day s travel what kind of a hat was that miss tonia he called that you ordered from san antone i can t help but be sorry about that hat a straw said tonia the latest shape of course trimmed with red roses that s what i like red roses there s no color more becoming to your complexion and hair said burrows admiringly it s what i like said tonia and of all the flowers give me red roses keep all the pinks and blues for yourself but what s the use when trestles burn and leave you without anything it ll be a dry old easter for me pearson took off his hat and drove road bunner at a gallop into the chaparral east of the espinosa ranch house as his stirrups rattled against the brush burrows s long legged sorrel struck out down the narrow stretch of open prairie to the southwest tonia hung up her quirt and went into the sitting room i m mighty sorry daughter that you didn t get your hat said her mother oh don t worry mother said tonia coolly i ll have a new hat all right in time to morrow when burrows reached the end of the strip of prairie he pulled his sorrel to the right and let him pick his way daintily across a sacuista flat through which ran the ragged dry bed of an arroyo then up a gravelly hill matted with bush the hoarse scrambled and at length emerged with a snort of satisfaction into a stretch of high level prairie grassy and dotted with the lighter green of mesquites in their fresh spring foliage always to the right burrows bore until in a little while he struck the old indian trail that followed the nueces southward and that passed twenty eight miles to the southeast through lone elm here burrows urged the sorrel into a steady lope as he settled himself in the saddle for a long ride he heard the drumming of hoofs the hollow thwack of chaparral against wooden stirrups the whoop of a comanche and wells pearson burst out of the brush at the right of the trail like a precocious yellow chick from a dark green easter egg except in the presence of awing femininity melancholy found no place in pearson s bosom in tonia s presence his voice was as soft as a summer bullfrog s in his reedy nest now at his gleesome yawp rabbits a mile away ducked their ears and sensitive plants closed their fearful fronds moved your lambing camp pretty far from the ranch haven t you neighbor asked pearson as road runner fell in at the sorrel s side twenty eight miles said burrows looking a little grim pearson s laugh woke an owl one hour too early in his water elm on the river bank half a mile away all right for you sheepman i like an open game myself we re two locoed he milliners hat hunting in the wilderness i notify you burr to mind your corrals we ve got an even start and the one that gets the headgear will stand some higher at the espinosa you ve got a good pony said burrows eyeing road runner s barrel like body and tapering legs that moved as regularly as the pistonrod of an engine it s a race of course but you re too much of a horseman to whoop it up this soon say we travel together till we get to the home stretch i m your company agreed pearson and i admire your sense if there s hats at lone elm one of em shall set on miss tonia s brow to morrow and you won t be at the crowning i ain t bragging burr but that sorrel of yours is weak in the fore legs my horse against yours offered burrows that miss tonia wears the hat i take her to cactus to morrow i ll take you up shouted pearson but oh it s just like horse stealing for me i can use that sorrel for a lady s animal when when somebody comes over to mucho calor and burrows dark face glowered so suddenly that the cowman broke off his sentence but pearson could never feel any pressure for long what s all this easter business about burr he asked cheerfully why do the women folks have to have new hats by the almanac or bust all cinches trying to get em it s a seasonable statute out of the testaments explained burrows it s ordered by the pope or somebody and it has something to do with the zodiac i don t know exactly but i think it was invented by the egyptians it s an all right jubilee if the heathens did put their brand on it said pearson or else tonia wouldn t have anything to do with it and they pull it off at church too suppose there ain t but one hat in the lone elm store burr then said burrows darkly the best man of us ll take it back to the espinosa oh man cried pearson throwing his hat high and catching it again there s nothing like you come off the sheep ranges before you talk good and collateral to the occasion and if there s more than one then said burrows we ll pick our choice and one of us ll get back first with his and the other won t there never was two souls proclaimed pearson to the stars that beat more like one heart than yourn and mine me and you might be riding on a unicorn and thinking out of the same piece of mind at a little past midnight the riders loped into lone elm the half a hundred houses of the big village were dark on its only street the big wooden store stood barred and shuttered in a few moments the horses were fastened and pearson was pounding cheerfully on the door of old sutton the storekeeper the barrel of a winchester came through a cranny of a solid window shutter followed by a short inquiry wells pearson of the mucho calor and burrows of green valley was the response we want to buy some goods in the store sorry to wake you up but we must have em come on out vncle tommy and get a move on you uncle tommy was slow but at length they got him behind his counter with a kerosene lamp lit and told him of their dire need easter hats said uncle tommy sleepily why yes i believe i have got just a couple left i only ordered a dozen this spring i ll show em to you now uncle tommy sutton was a merchant half asleep or awake in dusty pasteboard boxes under the counter he had two left over spring hats but alas for his commercial probity on that early saturday morn they were hats of two springs ago and a woman s eye would have detected the fraud at half a glance but to the unintelligent gaze of the cowpuncher and the sheepman they seemed fresh from the mint of contemporaneous april the hats were of a variety once known as cart wheels they were of stiff straw colored red and flat brimmed both were exactly alike and trimmed lavishly around their crowns with full blown immaculate artificial white roses that all you got uncle tommy said pearson all right not much choice here burr take your pick they re the latest styles lied uncle tommy you d see em on fifth avenue if you was in new york uncle tommy wrapped and tied each hat in two yards of dark calico for a protection one pearson tied carefully to his calfskin saddle thongs and the other became part of road runner s burden they shouted thanks and farewells to uncle tommy and cantered back into the night on the home stretch the horsemen jockeyed with all their skill they rode more slowly on their way back the few words they spoke were not unfriendly burrows had a winchester under his left leg slung over his saddle horn pearson had a six shooter belted around him thus men rode in the frio country at half past seven in the morning they rode to the top of a hill and saw the espinosa ranch a white spot under a dark patch of live oaks five miles away the sight roused pearson from his drooping pose in the saddle he knew what road runner could do the sorrel was lathered and stumbling frequently road runner was pegging away like a donkey engine pearson turned toward the sheepman and laughed good bye burr he cried with a wave of his hand it s a race now we re on the home stretch he pressed road runner with his knees and leaned toward the espinosa road runner struck into a gallop with tossing head and snorting nostrils as if he were fresh from a month in pasture pearson rode twenty yards and heard the unmistakable sound of a winchester lever throwing a cartridge into the barrel he dropped flat along his horse s back before the crack of the rifle reached his ears it is possible that burrows intended only to disable the horse he was a good enough shot to do that without endangering his rider but as pearson stooped the ball went through his shoulder and then through road runner s neck the horse fell and the cowman pitched over his head into the hard road and neither of them tried to move burrows rode on without stopping in two hours pearson opened his eyes and took inventory he managed to get to his feet and staggered back to where road runner was lying road runner was lying there but he appeared to be comfortable pearson examined him and found that the bullet had creased him he had been knocked out temporarily but not seriously hurt but he was tired and he lay there on miss tonia s hat and ate leaves from a mesquite branch that obligingly hung over the road pearson made the horse get up the easter hat loosed from the saddle thongs lay there in its calico wrappings a shapeless thing from its sojourn beneath the solid carcass of road runner then pearson fainted and fell head long upon the poor hat again crumpling it under his wounded shoulders it is hard to kill a cowpuncher in half an hour he revived long enough for a woman to have fainted twice and tried ice cream for a restorer he got up carefully and found road runner who was busy with the near by grass he tied the unfortunate hat to the saddle again and managed to get himself there too after many failures at noon a gay and fluttering company waited in front of the espinosa ranch the rogers girls were there in their new buckboard and the anchor o outfit and the green valley folks mostly women and each and every one wore her new easter hat even upon the lonely prairies for they greatly desired to shine forth and do honor to the coming festival at the gate stood tonia with undisguised tears upon her cheeks in her hand she held burrow s lone elm hat and it was at its white roses hated by her that she wept for her friends were telling her with the ecstatic joy of true friends that cart wheels could not be worn being three seasons passed into oblivion put on your old hat and come tonia they urged for easter sunday she answered i ll die first and wept again the hats of the fortunate ones were curved and twisted into the style of spring s latest proclamation a strange being rode out of the brush among them and there sat his horse languidly he was stained and disfigured with the green of the grass and the limestone of rocky roads hallo pearson said daddy weaver look like you ve been breaking a mustang what s that you ve got tied to your saddle a pig in a poke oh come on tonia if you re going said betty rogers we mustn t wait any longer we ve saved a seat in the buckboard for you never mind the hat that lovely muslin you ve got on looks sweet enough with any old hat pearson was slowly untying the queer thing on his saddle tonia looked at him with a sudden hope pearson was a man who created hope he got the thing loose and handed it to her her quick fingers tore at the strings best i could do said pearson slowly what road runner and me done to it will be about all it needs oh oh it s just the right shape shrieked tonia and red roses wait till i try it on she flew in to the glass and out again beaming radiating blossomed oh don t red become her chanted the girls in recitative hurry up tonia tonia stopped for a moment by the side of road runner thank you thank you wells she said happily it s just what i wanted won t you come over to cactus to morrow and go to church with me if i can said pearson he was looking curiously at her hat and then he grinned weakly tonia flew into the buckboard like a bird the vehicles sped away for cactus what have you been doing pearson asked daddy weaver you ain t looking so well as common me said pearson i ve been painting flowers them roses was white when i left lone elm help me down daddy weaver for i haven t got any more paint to spare round the circle this story is especially interesting as an early treatment of the theme afterward developed with a surer hand in the pendulum find yo shirt all right sam asked mrs webber from her chair under the live oak where she was comfortably seated with a paper back volume for company it balances perfeckly marthy answered sam with a suspicious pleasantness in his tone at first i was about ter be a little reckless and kick cause ther buttons was all off but since i diskiver that the button holes is all busted out why i wouldn t go so fur as to say

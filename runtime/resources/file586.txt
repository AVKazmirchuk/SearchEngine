had indeed come to paris in the year and related to the turkish spy an extraordinary story he claimed to be the wandering jew and that but here i fell asleep for my editorial duties had not been light that day judge hoover was the bugle s candidate for congress having to confer with him i sought his home early the next morning and we walked together down town through a little street with which i was unfamiliar did you ever hear of michob ader i asked him smiling why yes said the judge and that reminds me of my shoes he has for mending here is his shop now judge hoover stepped into a dingy small shop i looked up at the sign and saw mike o bader boot and shoe maker on it some wild geese passed above honking clearly i scratched my ear and frowned and then trailed into the shop there sat my wandering jew on his shoemaker s bench trimming a half sole he was drabbled with dew grass stained unkempt and miserable and on his face was still the unexplained wretchedness the problematic sorrow the esoteric woe that had been written there by nothing less it seemed than the stylus of the centuries judge hoover inquired kindly concerning his shoes the old shoemaker looked up and spoke sanely enough he had been ill he said for a few days the next day the shoes would be ready he looked at me and i could see that i had no place in his memory so out we went and on our way old mike remarked the candidate has been on one of his sprees he gets crazy drunk regularly once a month but he s a good shoemaker what is his history i inquired whiskey epitomized judge hoover that explains him i was silent but i did not accept the explanation and so when i had the chance i asked old man sellers who browsed daily on my exchanges mike o bader said he was makin shoes in montopolis when i come here goin on fifteen year ago i guess whiskey s his trouble once a month he gets off the track and stays so a week he s got a rigmarole somethin about his bein a jew pedler that he tells ev rybody nobody won t listen to him any more when he s sober he ain t sich a fool he s got a sight of books in the back room of his shop that he reads i guess you can lay all his trouble to whiskey but again i would not not yet was my wandering jew rightly construed for me i trust that women may not be allowed a title to all the curiosity in the world so when montopolis s oldest inhabitant some ninety score years younger than michob ader dropped in to acquire promulgation in print i siphoned his perpetual trickle of reminiscence in the direction of the uninterpreted maker of shoes uncle abner was the complete history of montopolis bound in butternut o bader he quavered come here in he was the first shoemaker in the place folks generally considers him crazy at times now but he don t harm nobody i s pose drinkin upset his mind yes drinkin very likely done it it s a powerful bad thing drinkin i m an old old man sir and i never see no good in drinkin i felt disappointment i was willing to admit drink in the case of my shoemaker but i preferred it as a recourse instead of a cause why had he pitched upon his perpetual strange note of the wandering jew why his unutterable grief during his aberration i could not yet accept whiskey as an explanation did mike o bader ever have a great loss or trouble of any kind i asked lemme see about thirty year ago there was somethin of the kind i recollect montopolis sir in them days used to be a mighty strict place well mike o bader had a daughter then a right pretty girl she was too gay a sort for montopolis so one day she slips off to another town and runs away with a circus it was two years before she comes back all fixed up in fine clothes and rings and jewellery to see mike he wouldn t have nothin to do with her so she stays around town awhile anyway i reckon the men folks wouldn t have raised no objections but the women egged em on to order her to leave town but she had plenty of spunk and told em to mind their own business so one night they decided to run her away a crowd of men and women drove her out of her house and chased her with sticks and stones she run to her father s door callin for help mike opens it and when he sees who it is he hits her with his fist and knocks her down and shuts the door and then the crowd kept on chunkin her till she run clear out of town and the next day they finds her drowned dead in hunter s mill pond i mind it all now that was thirty year ago i leaned back in my non rotary revolving chair and nodded gently like a mandarin at my paste pot when old mike has a spell went on uncle abner tepidly garrulous he thinks he s the wanderin jew he is said i nodding away and uncle abner cackled insinuatingly at the editor s remark for he was expecting at least a stickful in the personal notes of the bugle the duplicity of hargraves when major pendleton talbot of mobile sir and his daughter miss lydia talbot came to washington to reside they selected for a boarding place a house that stood fifty yards back from one of the quietest avenues it was an old fashioned

as an earthquake would the illumination waxed to a glare so fierce that i clapped my hands over my eyes to save them i thought the end of the world had come i could think of no natural phenomenon that would explain it my wits were staggering the deafening explosion trailed off into the rumbling roar that had preceded it and through this i heard the frightened shouts of my troops as they stumbled from their resting places and rushed wildly about also i heard the harsh tones of kearny s voice crying they ll blame it on me of course and what the devil it is it s not francis kearny that can give you an answer i opened my eyes the hills were still there dark and solid it had not been then a volcano or an earthquake i looked up at the sky and saw a comet like trail crossing the zenith and extending westward a fiery trail waning fainter and narrower each moment a meteor i called aloud a meteor has fallen there is no danger and then all other sounds were drowned by a great shout from kearny s throat he had raised both hands above his head and was standing tiptoe phoebe s gone he cried with all his lungs she s busted and gone to hell look captain the little red headed hoodoo has blown herself to smithereens she found kearny too tough to handle and she puffed up with spite and meanness till her boiler blew up it s be bad luck kearny no more oh let us be joyful humpty dumpty sat on a wall humpty busted and that ll be all i looked up wondering and picked out saturn in his place but the small red twinkling luminary in his vicinity which kearny had pointed out to me as his evil star had vanished i had seen it there but half an hour before there was no doubt that one of those awful and mysterious spasms of nature had hurled it from the heavens i clapped kearny on the shoulder little man said i let this clear the way for you it appears that astrology has failed to subdue you your horoscope must be cast anew with pluck and loyalty for controlling stars i play you to win now get to your tent and sleep daybreak is the word at nine o clock on the morning of the eighteenth of july i rode into aguas frias with kearny at my side in his clean linen suit and with his military poise and keen eye he was a model of a fighting adventurer i had visions of him riding as commander of president valdevia s body guard when the plums of the new republic should begin to fall carlos followed with the troops and supplies he was to halt in a wood outside the town and remain concealed there until he received the word to advance kearny and i rode down the calle ancha toward the residencia of don rafael at the other side of the town as we passed the superb white buildings of the university of esperando i saw at an open window the gleaming spectacles and bald head of herr bergowitz professor of the natural sciences and friend of don rafael and of me and of the cause he waved his hand to me with his broad bland smile there was no excitement apparent in aguas frias the people went about leisurely as at all times the market was thronged with bare headed women buying fruit and carne we heard the twang and tinkle of string bands in the patios of the cantinas we could see that it was a waiting game that don rafael was playing his residencia as a large but low building around a great courtyard in grounds crowed with ornamental trees and tropic shrubs at his door an old woman who came informed us that don rafael had not yet arisen tell him said i that captain malone and a friend wish to see him at once perhaps he has overslept she came back looking frightened i have called she said and rung his bell many times but he does not answer i knew where his sleeping room was kearny and i pushed by her and went to it i put my shoulder against the thin door and forced it open in an armchair by a great table covered with maps and books sat don rafael with his eyes closed i touched his hand he had been dead many hours on his head above one ear was a wound caused by a heavy blow it had ceased to bleed long before i made the old woman call a mozo and dispatched him in haste to fetch herr bergowitz he came and we stood about as if we were half stunned by the awful shock thus can the letting of a few drops of blood from one man s veins drain the life of a nation presently herr bergowitz stooped and picked up a darkish stone the size of an orange which he saw under the table he examined it closely through his great glasses with the eye of science a fragment said he of a detonating meteor the most remarkable one in twenty years exploded above this city a little after midnight this morning the professor looked quickly up at the ceiling we saw the blue sky through a hole the size of an orange nearly above don rafael s chair i heard a familiar sound and turned kearny had thrown himself on the floor and was babbling his compendium of bitter blood freezing curses against the star of his evil luck undoubtedly phoebe had been feminine even when hurtling on her way to fiery dissolution and everlasting doom the last word had been hers captain malone was not unskilled in narrative he knew the point where a story should end i sat reveling

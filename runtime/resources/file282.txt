and carried him into the back room of the cafe the temple i mean and leaned him against the wall it was more work than bouncing three live ones from an all night broadway joint on new year s eve then high jack ran out and brought in a couple of them indian silk shawls and began to undress himself oh figs says i is it thus strong drink is an adder and subtractor too is it the heat or the call of the wild that s got you but high jack is too full of exaltation and cane juice to reply he stops the disrobing business just short of the manhattan beach rules and then winds them red and white shawls around him and goes out and stands on the pedestal as steady as any platinum deity you ever saw and i looks through a peek hole to see what he is up to in a few minutes in comes the girl with the flower wreath danged if i wasn t knocked a little silly when she got close she looked so exactly much like florence blue feather i wonder says i to myself if she has been reincarcerated too if i could see says i to myself whether she has a mole on her left but the next minute i thought she looked one eighth of a shade darker than florence but she looked good at that and high jack hadn t drunk all the rum that had been drank the girl went up within ten feet of the bum idol and got down and massaged her nose with the floor like the rest did then she went nearer and laid the flower wreath on the block of stone at high jack s feet rummy as i was i thought it was kind of nice of her to think of offering flowers instead of household and kitchen provisions even a stone god ought to appreciate a little sentiment like that on top of the fancy groceries they had piled up in front of him and then high jack steps down from his pedestal quiet and mentions a few words that sounded just like the hieroglyphics carved on the walls of the ruin the girl gives a little jump backward and her eyes fly open as big as doughnuts but she don t beat it why didn t she i ll tell you why i think why it don t seem to a girl so supernatural unlikely strange and startling that a stone god should come to life for her if he was to do it for one of them snub nosed brown girls on the other side of the woods now it would be different but her i ll bet she said to herself well goodness me you ve been a long time getting on your job i ve half a mind not to speak to you but she and high jack holds hands and walks away out of the temple together by the time i d had time to take another drink and enter upon the scene they was twenty yards away going up the path in the woods that the girl had come down with the natural scenery already in place it was just like a play to watch em she looking up at him and him giving her back the best that an indian can hand out in the way of a goo goo eye but there wasn t anything in that recarnification and revulsion to tintype for me hey injun i yells out to high jack we ve got a board bill due in town and you re leaving me without a cent brace up and cut out the neapolitan fisher maiden and let s go back home but on the two goes without looking once back until as you might say the forest swallowed em up and i never saw or heard of high jack snakefeeder from that day to this i don t know if the cherokees came from the aspics but if they did one of em went back all i could do was to hustle back to that boca place and panhandle major bing he detached himself from enough of his winnings to buy me a ticket home and i m back again on the job at chubb s sir and i m going to hold it steady come round and you ll find the steaks as good as ever i wondered what hunky magee thought about his own story so i asked him if he had any theories about reincarnation and transmogrification and such mysteries as he had touched upon nothing like that said hunky positively what ailed high jack was too much booze and education they ll do an indian up every time but what about miss blue feather i persisted say said hunky with a grin that little lady that stole high jack certainly did give me a jar when i first took a look at her but it was only for a minute you remember i told you high jack said that miss florence blue feather disappeared from home about a year ago well where she landed four days later was in as neat a five room flat on east twenty third street as you ever walked sideways through and she s been mrs magee ever since the moment of victory ben granger is a war veteran aged twenty nine which should enable you to guess the war he is also principal merchant and postmaster of cadiz a little town over which the breezes from the gulf of mexico perpetually blow ben helped to hurl the don from his stronghold in the greater antilles and then hiking across half the world he marched as a corporal usher up and down the blazing tropic aisles of the open air college in which the filipino was schooled now with his bayonet beaten into a cheese slicer he rallies

right kind of a swell anything else to the queer about me your tie said vuyning is tied with absolute precision and correctness thanks gratefully i spent over half an hour at it before i thereby interrupted vuyning completing your resemblance to a dummy in a broadway store window yours truly said emerson sitting down again it s bully of you to put me wise i knew there was something wrong but i couldn t just put my finger on it i guess it comes by nature to know how to wear clothes oh i suppose said vuyning with a laugh that my ancestors picked up the knack while they were peddling clothes from house to house a couple of hundred years ago i m told they did that and mine said emerson cheerfully were making their visits at night i guess and didn t have a chance to catch on to the correct styles i tell you what said vuyning whose ennui had taken wings i ll take you to my tailor he ll eliminate the mark of the beast from your exterior that is if you care to go any further in the way of expense play em to the ceiling said emerson with a boyish smile of joy i ve got a roll as big around as a barrel of black eyed peas and as loose as the wrapper of a two for fiver i don t mind telling you that i was not touring among the antipodes when the burglar proof safe of the farmers national bank of butterville ia flew open some moonless nights ago to the tune of aren t you afraid asked vuyning that i ll call a cop and hand you over you tell me said emerson coolly why i didn t keep them he laid vuyning s pocketbook and watch the vuyning year old family watch on the table man said vuyning revelling did you ever hear the tale kirk tells about the six pound trout and the old fisherman seems not said emerson politely i d like to but you won t said vuyning i ve heard it scores of times that s why i won t tell you i was just thinking how much better this is than a club now shall we go to my tailor boys and elderly gents said vuyning five days later at his club standing up against the window where his coterie was gathered and keeping out the breeze a friend of mine from the west will dine at our table this evening will he ask if we have heard the latest from denver said a member squirming in his chair will he mention the new twenty three story ma sonic temple in quincy ill inquired another dropping his nose glasses will he spring one of those western mississippi river catfish stories in which they use yearling calves for bait demanded kirk fiercely be comforted said vuyning he has none of the little vices he is a burglar and safe blower and a pal of mine oh mary ann said they must you always adorn every statement with your alleged humor it came to pass that at eight in the evening a calm smooth brilliant affable man sat at vuyning s right hand during dinner and when the ones who pass their lives in city streets spoke of skyscrapers or of the little czar on his far frozen throne or of insig nificant fish from inconsequential streams this big deep chested man faultlessly clothed and eyed like an emperor disposed of their lilliputian chatter with a wink of his eyelash and then he painted for them with hard broad strokes a marvellous lingual panorama of the west he stacked snow topped mountains on the table freezing the hot dishes of the waiting diners with a wave of his hand he swept the clubhouse into a pine crowned gorge turning the waiters into a grim posse and each listener into a blood stained fugitive climbing with torn fingers upon the ensanguined rocks he touched the table and spake and the five panted as they gazed on barren lava beds and each man took his tongue between his teeth and felt his mouth bake at the tale of a land empty of water and food as simply as homer sang while he dug a tine of his fork leisurely into the tablecloth he opened a new world to their view as does one who tells a child of the looking glass country as one of his listeners might have spoken of tea too strong at a madison square afternoon so he depicted the ravages of redeye in a border town when the caballeros of the lariat and forty five reduced ennui to a minimum and then with a sweep of his white unringed hands be dismissed melpomene and forthwith diana and amaryllis footed it before the mind s eyes of the clubmen the savannas of the continent spread before them the wind humming through a hundred leagues of sage brush and mesquite closed their ears to the city s staccato noises he told them of camps of ranches marooned in a sea of fragrant prairie blos soms of gallops in the stilly night that apollo would have forsaken his daytime steeds to enjoy he read them the great rough epic of the cattle and the hills that have not been spoiled by the band of man the mason his words were a telescope to the city men whose eyes had looked upon youngstown o and whose tongues had called it west in fact emerson had them going the next morning at ten he met vuyning by ap pointment at a forty second street cafe emerson was to leave for the west that day he wore a suit of dark cheviot that looked to have been draped upon him by an ancient grecian tailor who was a few thousand years ahead of the styles mr vuyning said

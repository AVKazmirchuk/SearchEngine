of the whitest men i ever knew as a cherokee he was a gentleman on the first ballot as a ward of the nation he was mighty hard to carry at the primaries john tom and me got together and began to make medicine how to get up some lawful genteel swindle which we might work in a quiet way so as not to excite the stupidity of the police or the cupidity of the larger corporations we had close upon between us and we pined to make it grow as all respectable capitalists do so we figured out a proposition which seems to be as honorable as a gold mine prospectus and as profitable as a church raffle and inside of thirty days you find us swarming into kansas with a pair of fluent horses and a red camping wagon on the european plan john tom is chief wish heap dough the famous indian medicine man and samaritan sachem of the seven tribes mr peters is business manager and half owner we needed a third man so we looked around and found j conyngham binkly leaning against the want column of a newspaper this binkly has a disease for shakespearian roles and an hallucination about a nights run on the new york stage but he confesses that he never could earn the butter to spread on his william s roles so he is willing to drop to the ordinary baker s kind and be satisfied with a mile run behind the medicine ponies besides richard iii he could do twenty seven coon songs and banjo specialties and was willing to cook and curry the horses we carried a fine line of excuses for taking money one was a magic soap for removing grease spots and quarters from clothes one was a sum wah tah the great indian remedy made from a prairie herb revealed by the great spirit in a dream to his favorite medicine men the great chiefs mcgarrity and siberstein bottlers chicago and the other was a frivolous system of pick pocketing the kansasters that had the department stores reduced to a decimal fraction look ye a pair of silk garters a dream book one dozen clothespins a gold tooth and when knighthood was in flower all wrapped up in a genuine japanese silkarina handkerchief and handed to the handsome lady by mr peters for the trivial sum of fifty cents while professor binkly entertains us in a three minute round with the banjo twas an eminent graft we had we ravaged peacefully through the state determined to remove all doubt as to why twas called bleeding kansas john tom little bear in full indian chief s costume drew crowds away from the parchesi sociables and government ownership conversaziones while at the football college in the east he had acquired quantities of rhetoric and the art of calisthenics and sophistry in his classes and when he stood up in the red wagon and explained to the farmers eloquent about chilblains and hyperaesthesia of the cranium jeff couldn t hand out the indian remedy fast enough for em one night we was camped on the edge of a little town out west of salina we always camped near a stream and put up a little tent sometimes we sold out of the remedy unexpected and then chief wish heap dough would have a dream in which the manitou commanded him to fill up a few bottles of sum wah tah at the most convenient place twas about ten o clock and we d just got in from a street performance i was in the tent with the lantern figuring up the day s profits john tom hadn t taken off his indian make up and was sitting by the campfire minding a fine sirloin steak in the pan for the professor till he finished his hair raising scene with the trained horses all at once out of dark bushes comes a pop like a firecracker and john tom gives a grunt and digs out of his bosom a little bullet that has dented itself against his collar bone john tom makes a dive in the direction of the fireworks and comes back dragging by the collar a kid about nine or ten years young in a velveteen suit with a little nickel mounted rifle in his hand about as big as a fountain pen here you pappoose says john tom what are you gunning for with that howitzer you might hit somebody in the eye come out jeff and mind the steak don t let it burn while i investigate this demon with the pea shooter cowardly redskin says the kid like he was quoting from a favorite author dare to burn me at the stake and the paleface will sweep you from the prairies like like everything now you lemme go or i ll tell mamma john tom plants the kid on a camp stool and sits down by him now tell the big chief he says why you try to shoot pellets into your uncle john s system didn t you know it was loaded are you a indian asks the kid looking up cute as you please at john tom s buckskin and eagle feathers i am says john tom well then that s why answers the boy swinging his feet i nearly let the steak burn watching the nerve of that youngster o ho says john tom i see you re the boy avenger and you ve sworn to rid the continent of the savage redman is that about the way of it son the kid halfway nodded his head and then he looked glum twas indecent to wring his secret from his bosom before a single brave had fallen before his parlor rifle now tell us where your wigwam is pappoose says john tom where you live your mamma will be worrying about you being out so late tell me and i ll take you home the kid grins i guess not he says i live thousands and thousands of miles over there he gyrated his hand toward the horizon i come on the train he says by myself i got off here because the conductor said my ticket had ex pirated he looks at john tom with sudden suspicion i bet you ain t a indian he says you don t talk like a indian you look like one but all a indian can say is heap good and paleface die say i bet you are one of them make believe indians that sell medicine on the streets i saw one once in quincy you never mind says john tom whether i m a cigar sign or a tammany cartoon the question before the council is what s to be done with you you ve run away from home you ve been reading howells you ve disgraced the profession of boy avengers by trying to shoot a tame indian and never saying die dog of a redskin you have crossed the path of the boy avenger nineteen times too often what do you mean by it the kid thought for a minute i guess i made a mistake he says i ought to have gone farther west they find em wild out there in the canyons he holds out his hand to john tom the little rascal please excuse me sir says he for shooting at you i hope it didn t hurt you but you ought to be more careful when a scout sees a indian in his war dress his rifle must speak little bear give a big laugh with a whoop at the end of it and swings the kid ten feet high and sets him on his shoulder and the runaway fingers the fringe and the eagle feathers and is full of the joy the white man knows when he dangles his heels against an inferior race it is plain that little bear and that kid are chums from that on the little renegade has already smoked the pipe of peace with the savage and you can see in his eye that he is figuring on a tomahawk and a pair of moccasins children s size we have supper in the tent the youngster looks upon me and the professor as ordinary braves only intended as a background to the camp scene when he is seated on a box of sum wah tah with the edge of the table sawing his neck and his mouth full of beefsteak little bear calls for his name roy says the kid with a sirloiny sound to it but when the rest of it and his post office address is referred to he shakes his head i guess not he says you ll send me back i want to stay with you i like this camping out at home we fellows had a camp in our back yard they called me roy the red wolf i guess that ll do for a name gimme another piece of beefsteak please we had to keep that kid we knew there was a hullabaloo about him somewheres and that mamma and uncle harry and aunt jane and the chief of police were hot after finding his trail but not another word would he tell us in two days he was the mascot of the big medicine outfit and all of us had a sneaking hope that his owners wouldn t turn up when the red wagon was doing business he was in it and passed up the bottles to mr peters as proud and satisfied as a prince that s abjured a two hundred dollar crown for a million dollar parvenuess once john tom asked him something about his papa i ain t got any papa he says he runned away and left us he made my mamma cry aunt lucy says he s a shape a what somebody asks him a shape says the kid some kind of a shape lemme see oh yes a feendenuman shape i don t know what it means john tom was for putting our brand on him and dressing him up like a little chief with wampum and beads but i vetoes it somebody s lost that kid is my view of it and they may want him you let me try him with a few stratagems and see if i can t get a look at his visiting card so that night i goes up to mr roy blank by the camp fire and looks at him contemptuous and scornful snickenwitzel says i like the word made me sick snickenwitzel bah before i d be named snickenwitzel what s the matter with you jeff says the kid opening his eyes wide snickenwitzel i repeats and i spat the word out i saw a man to day from your town and he told me your name i m not surprised you was ashamed to tell it snickenwitzel whew ah here now says the boy indignant and wriggling all over what s the matter with you that ain t my name it s conyers what s the matter with you and that s not the worst of it i went on quick keeping him hot and not giving him time to think we thought you was from a nice well to do family here s mr little bear a chief of the cherokees entitled to wear nine otter tails on his sunday blanket and professor binkly who plays shakespeare and the banjo and me that s got hundreds of dollars in that black tin box in the wagon and we ve got to be careful about the company we keep that man tells me your folks live way down in little old hencoop alley where there are no sidewalks and the goats eat off the table with you that kid was almost crying now taint so he splutters he he don t know what he s talking about we live on poplar av noo i don t sociate with goats what s the matter with you poplar avenue says i sarcastic poplar avenue that s a street to live on it only runs two blocks and then falls off a bluff you can throw a keg of nails the whole length of it don t talk to me about poplar avenue it s it s miles long says the kid our number s and there s lots of houses after that what s the matter with aw you make me tired jeff well well now says i i guess that man made a mistake maybe it was some other boy he was talking about if i catch him i ll teach him to go around slandering people and after supper i goes up town and telegraphs to mrs conyers poplar avenue quincy ill that the kid is safe and sassy with us and will be held for further orders in two hours an answer comes to hold him tight and she ll start for him by next train the next train was due at p m the next day and me and john tom was at the depot with the kid you might scour the plains in vain for the big chief wish heap dough in his place is mr little bear in the human habiliments of the anglo saxon sect and the leather of his shoes is patented and the loop of his necktie is copyrighted for these things john tom had grafted on him at college along with metaphysics and the knockout guard for the low tackle but for his complexion which is some yellowish and the black mop of his straight hair you might have thought here was an ordinary man out of the city directory that subscribes for magazines and pushes the lawn mower in his shirt sleeves of evenings then the train rolled in and a little woman in a gray dress with sort of illuminating hair slides off and looks around quick and the boy avenger sees her and yells mamma and she cries o and they meet in a clinch and now the pesky redskins can come forth from their caves on the plains without fear any more of the rifle of roy the red wolf mrs conyers comes up and thanks me an john tom without the usual extremities you always look for in a woman she says just enough in a way to convince and there is no incidental music by the orchestra i made a few illiterate requisitions upon the art of conversation at which the lady smiles friendly as if she had known me a week and then mr little bear adorns the atmosphere with the various idioms into which education can fracture the wind of speech i could see the kid s mother didn t quite place john tom but it seemed she was apprised in his dialects and she played up to his lead in the science of making three words do the work of one that kid introduced us with some footnotes and explanations that made things plainer than a week of rhetoric he danced around and punched us in the back and tried to climb john tom s leg this is john tom mamma says he he s a indian he sells medicine in a red wagon i shot him but he wasn t wild the other one s jeff he s a fakir too come on and see the camp where we live won t you mamma it is plain to see that the life of the woman is in that boy she has got him again where her arms can gather him and that s enough she s ready to do anything to please him she hesitates the eighth of a second and takes another look at these men i imagine she says to herself about john tom seems to be a gentleman if his hair don t curl and mr peters she disposes of as follows no ladies man but a man who knows a lady so we all rambled down to the camp as neighborly as coming from a wake and there she inspects the wagon and pats the place with her hand where the kid used to sleep and dabs around her eyewinkers with her handkerchief and professor binkly gives us trovatore on one strong of the banjo and is about to slide off into hamlet s monologue when one of the horses gets tangled in his rope and he must go look after him and says something about foiled again when it got dark me and john tom walked back up to the corn exchange hotel and the four of us had supper there i think the trouble started at that supper for then was when mr little bear made an intellectual balloon ascension i held on to the tablecloth and listened to him soar that redman if i could judge had the gift of information he took language and did with it all a roman can do with macaroni his vocal remarks was all embroidered over with the most scholarly verbs and prefixes and his syllables was smooth and fitted nicely to the joints of his idea i thought i d heard him talk before but i hadn t and it wasn t the size of his words but the way they come and twasn t his subjects for he spoke of common things like cathedrals and football and poems and catarrh and souls and freight rates and sculpture mrs conyers understood his accents and the elegant sounds went back and forth between em and now and then jefferson d peters would intervene a few shop worn senseless words to have the butter passed or another leg of the chicken yes john tom little bear appeared to be inveigled some in his bosom about that mrs conyers she was of the kind that pleases she had the good looks and more i ll tell you you take one of these cloak models in a big store they strike you as being on the impersonal system they are adapted for the eye what they run to is inches around and complexion and the art of fanning the delusion that the sealskin would look just as well on the lady with the warts and the pocket book now if one of them models was off duty and you took it and it would say charlie when you pressed it and sit up at the table why then you would have something similar to mrs conyers i could see how john tom could resist any inclination to hate that white squaw the lady and the kid stayed at the hotel in the morning they say they will start for home me and little bear left at eight o clock and sold indian remedy on the courthouse square till nine he leaves me and the professor to drive down to camp while he stays up town i am not enamored with that plan for it shows john tom is uneasy in his composures and that leads to firewater and sometimes to the green corn dance and costs not often does chief wish heap dough get busy with the firewater but whenever he does there is heap much doing in the lodges of the palefaces who wear blue and carry the club at half past nine professor binkly is rolled in his quilt snoring in blank verse and i am sitting by the fire listening to the frogs mr little bear slides into camp and sits down against a tree there is no symptoms of firewater jeff says he after a long time a little boy came west to hunt indians well then says i for i wasn t thinking as he was and he bagged one says john tom and twas not with a gun and he never had on a velveteen suit of clothes in his life and then i began to catch his smoke i know it says i and i ll bet you his pictures are on valentines and fool men are his game red and white you win on the red says john tom calm jeff for how many ponies do you think i could buy mrs conyers scandalous talk i replies tis not a paleface custom john tom laughs loud and bites into a cigar no he answers tis the savage equivalent for the dollars of the white man s marriage settlement oh i know there s an eternal wall between the races if i could do it jeff i d put a torch to every white college that a redman has ever set foot inside why don t you leave us alone he says to our own ghost dances and dog feasts and our dingy squaws to cook our grasshopper soup and darn our moccasins now you sure don t mean disrespect to the perennial blossom entitled education says i scandalized because i wear it in the bosom of my own intellectual shirt waist i ve had education says i and never took any harm from it you lasso us goes on little bear not noticing my prose insertions and teach us what is beautiful in literature and in life and how to appreciate what is fine in men and women what have you done to me says he you ve made me a cherokee moses you ve taught me to hate the wigwams and love the white man s ways i can look over into the promised land and see mrs conyers but my place is on the reservation little bear stands up in his chief s dress and laughs again but white man jeff he goes on the paleface provides a recourse tis a temporary one but it gives a respite and the name of it is whiskey and straight off he walks up the path to town again now says i in my mind may the manitou move him to do only bailable things this night for i perceive that john tom is about to avail himself of the white man s solace maybe it was as i sat smoking when i hear pit a pats on the path and here comes mrs conyers running her hair twisted up any way and a look on her face that says burglars and mice and the flour s all out rolled in one oh mr peters she calls out as they will oh oh i made a quick think and i spoke the gist of it out loud now says i we ve been brothers me and that indian but i ll make a good one of him in two minutes if no no she says wild and cracking her knuckles i haven t seen mr little bear tis my husband he s stolen my boy oh she says just when i had him back in my arms again that heartless villain every bitterness life knows she says he s made me drink my poor little lamb that ought to be warm in his bed carried of by that fiend how did all this happen i ask let s have the facts i was fixing his bed she explains and roy was playing on the hotel porch and he drives up to the steps i heard roy scream and ran out my husband had him in the buggy then i begged him for my child this is what he gave me she turns her face to the light there is a crimson streak running across her cheek and mouth he did that with his whip she says come back to the hotel says i and we ll see what can be done on the way she tells me some of the wherefores when he slashed her with the whip he told her he found out she was coming for the kid and he was on the same train mrs conyers had been living with her brother and they d watched the boy always as her husband had tried to steal him before i judge that man was worse than a street railway promoter it seems he had spent her money and slugged her and killed her canary bird and told it around that she had cold feet at the hotel we found a mass meeting of five infuriated citizens chewing tobacco and denouncing the outrage most of the town was asleep by ten o clock i talks the lady some quiet and tells her i will take the one o clock train for the next town forty miles east for it is likely that the esteemed mr conyers will drive there to take the cars i don t know i tells her but what he has legal rights but if i find him i can give him an illegal left in the eye and tie him up for a day or two anyhow on a disturbal of the peace proposition mrs conyers goes inside and cries with the landlord s wife who is fixing some catnip tea that will make everything all right for the poor dear the landlord comes out on the porch thumbing his one suspender and says to me ain t had so much excitements in town since bedford steegall s wife swallered a spring lizard i seen him through the winder hit her with the buggy whip and everything what s that suit of clothes cost you you got on pears like we d have some rain don t it say doc that indian of yorn s on a kind of a whizz to night ain t he he comes along just before you did and i told him about this here occurrence he gives a cur us kind of a hoot and trotted off i guess our constable ll have him in the lock up fore morning i thought i d sit on the porch and wait for the one o clock train i wasn t feeling saturated with mirth here was john tom on one of his sprees and this kidnapping business losing sleep for me but then i m always having trouble with other people s troubles every few minutes mrs conyers would come out on the porch and look down the road the way the buggy went like she expected to see that kid coming back on a white pony with a red apple in his hand now wasn t that like a woman and that brings up cats i saw a mouse go in this hole says mrs cat you can go prize up a plank over there if you like i ll watch this hole about a quarter to one o clock the lady comes out again restless crying easy as females do for their own amusement and she looks down that road again and listens now ma am says i there s no use watching cold wheel tracks by this time they re halfway to hush she says holding up her hand and i do hear something coming flip flap in the dark and then there is the awfulest war whoop ever heard outside of madison square garden at a buffalo bill matinee and up the steps and on to the porch jumps the disrespectable indian the lamp in the hall shines on him and i fail to recognize mr j t little bear alumnus of the class of what i see is a cherokee brave and the warpath is what he has been travelling firewater and other things have got him going his buckskin is hanging in strings and his feathers are mixed up like a frizzly hen s the dust of miles is on his moccasins and the light in his eye is the kind the aborigines wear but in his arms he brings that kid his eyes half closed with his little shoes dangling and one hand fast around the indian s collar pappoose says john tom and i notice that the flowers of the white man s syntax have left his tongue he is the original proposition in bear s claws and copper color me bring says he and he lays the kid in his mother s arms run fifteen mile says john tom ugh catch white man bring pappoose the little woman is in extremities of gladness she must wake up that stir up trouble youngster and hug him and make proclamation that he is his mamma s own precious treasure i was about to ask questions but i looked at mr little bear and my eye caught the sight of something in his belt now go to bed ma am says i and this gadabout youngster likewise for there s no more danger and the kidnapping business is not what it was earlier in the night i inveigled john tom down to camp quick and when he tumbled over asleep i got that thing out of his belt and disposed of it where the eye of education can t see it for even the football colleges disapprove of the art of scalp taking in their curriculums it is ten o clock next day when john tom wakes up and looks around i am glad to see the nineteenth century in his eyes again what was it jeff he asks heap firewater says i john tom frowns and thinks a little combined says he directly with the interesting little physiological shake up known as reversion to type i remember now have they gone yet on the train i answers ugh says john tom better so paleface bring big chief wish heap dough a little bromo seltzer and then he ll take up the redman s burden again helping the other fellow originally published in munsey s magazine december but can thim that helps others help thimselves mulvaney this is the story that william trotter told me on the beach at aguas frescas while i waited for the gig of the captain of the fruit steamer andador which was to take me abroad reluctantly i was leaving the land of always afternoon william was remaining and he favored me with a condensed oral autobiography as we sat on the sands in the shade cast by the bodega nacional as usual i became aware that the man from bombay had already written the story but as he had compressed it to an eight word sentence i have become an expansionist and have quoted his phrase above with apologies to him and best regards to terence ii don t you ever have a desire to go back to the land of derby hats and starched collars i asked him you seem to be a handy man and a man of action i continued and i am sure i could find you a comfortable job somewhere in the states ragged shiftless barefooted a confirmed eater of the lotos william trotter had pleased me much and i hated to see him gobbled up by the tropics i ve no doubt you could he said idly splitting the bark from a section of sugar cane i ve no doubt you could do much for me if every man could do as much for himself as he can for others every country in the world would be holding millenniums instead of centennials there seemed to be pabulum in w t s words and then another idea came to me i had a brother in chicopee falls who owned manufactories cotton or sugar or a a sheetings or something in the commercial line lie was vulgarly rich and therefore reverenced art the artistic temperament of the family was monopolized at my birth i knew that brother james would honor my slightest wish i would demand from him a position in cotton sugar or sheetings for william trotter something say at two hundred a month or thereabouts i confided my beliefs and made my large propositions to william he had pleased me much and he was ragged while we were talking there was a sound of firing guns four or five rattlingly as if by a squad the cheerful noise came from the direction of the cuartel which is a kind of makeshift barracks for the soldiers of the republic hear that said william trotter let me tell you about it a year ago i landed on this coast with one solitary dollar i have the same sum in my pocket to day i was second cook on a tramp fruiter and they marooned me here early one morning without benefit of clergy just because i poulticed the face of the first mate with cheese omelette at dinner the fellow had kicked because i d put horseradish in it instead of cheese when they threw me out of the yawl into three feet of surf i waded ashore and sat down under a palm tree by and by a fine looking white man with a red face and white clothes genteel as possible but somewhat under the influence came and sat down beside me i had noticed there was a kind of a village back of the beach and enough scenery to outfit a dozen moving picture shows but i thought of course it was a cannibal suburb and i was wondering whether i was to be served with carrots or mushrooms and as i say this dressed up man sits beside me and we become friends in the space of a minute or two for an hour we talked and he told me all about it it seems that he was a man of parts conscientiousness and plausibility besides being educated and a wreck to his appetites he told me all about it colleges had turned him out and distilleries had taken him in did i tell you his name it was clifford wainwright i didn t exactly catch the cause of his being cast away on that particular stretch of south america but i reckon it was his own business i asked him if he d ever been second cook on a tramp fruiter and he said no so that concluded my line of surmises but he talked like the encyclopedia from a berlin to trilo zyria and he carried a watch a silver arrangement with works and up to date within twenty four hours anyhow i m pleased to have met you says wainwright i m a devotee to the great joss booze but my ruminating facilities are unrepaired says he or words to that effect and i hate says he to see fools trying to run the world i never touch a drop says i and there are many kinds of fools and the world runs on its own apex according to science with no meddling from me i was referring says he to the president of this republic his country is in a desperate condition its treasury is empty it s on the verge of war with nicamala and if it wasn t for the hot weather the people would be starting revolutions in every town here is a nation goes on wainwright on the brink of destruction a man of intelligence could rescue it from its impending doom in one day by issuing the necessary edicts and orders president gomez knows nothing of statesmanship or policy do you know adam smith lemme see says i there was a one eared man named smith in fort worth texas but i think his first name was i am referring to the political economist says wainwright s mother smith then says i the one i speak of never was arrested so wainwright boils some more with indignation at the insensibility of people who are not corpulent to fill public positions and then he tells me he is going out to the president s summer palace which is four miles from aguas frescas to instruct him in the art of running steam heated republics come along with me trotter says he and i ll show you what brains can do anything in it i asks the satisfaction says he of redeeming a country of two hundred thousand population from ruin back to prosperity and peace great says i i ll go with you i d prefer to eat a live broiled lobster just now but give me liberty as second choice if i can t be in at the death wainwright and me permeates through the town and he halts at a rum dispensary have you any money he asks i have says i fishing out my silver dollar i always go about with adequate sums of money then we ll drink says wainwright not me says i not any demon ruin or any of its ramifications for mine it s one of my non weaknesses it s my failing says he what s your particular soft point industry says i promptly i m hard working diligent industrious and energetic my dear mr trotter says he surely i ve known you long enough to tell you you are a liar every man must have his own particular weakness and his own particular strength in other things now you will buy me a drink of rum and we will call on president gomez iii well sir trotter went on we walks the four miles out through a virgin conservatory of palms and ferns and other roof garden products to the president s summer white house it was blue and reminded you of what you see on the stage in the third act which they describe as same as the first on the programs there was more than fifty people waiting outside the iron fence that surrounded the house and grounds there was generals and agitators and epergnes in gold laced uniforms and citizens in diamonds and panama hats all waiting to get an audience with the royal five card draw and in a kind of a summer house in front of the mansion we could see a burnt sienna man eating breakfast out of gold dishes and taking his time i judged that the crowd outside had come out for their morning orders and requests and was afraid to intrude but c wainwright wasn t the gate was open and he walked inside and up to the president s table as confident as a man who knows the head waiter in a fifteen cent restaurant and i went with him because i had only seventy five cents and there was nothing else to do the gomez man rises from his chair and looks colored man as he was like he was about to call out for corporal of the guard post number one but wainwright says some phrases to him in a peculiarly lubricating manner and the first thing you know we was all three of us seated at the table with coffee and rolls and iguana cutlets coming as fast as about ninety peons could rustle em and then wainwright begins to talk but the president interrupts him you yankees says he polite assuredly take the cake for assurance i assure you or words to that effect he spoke english better than you or me you ve had a long walk says he but it s nicer in the cool morning to walk than to ride may i suggest some refreshments says he rum says wainwright gimme a cigar says i well sir the two talked an hour keeping the generals and equities all in their good uniforms waiting outside the fence and while i smoked silent i listened to clifford wainwright making a solid republic out of the wreck of one i didn t follow his arguments with any special collocation of international intelligibility but he had mr gomez s attention glued and riveted he takes out a pencil and marks the white linen tablecloth all over with figures and estimates and deductions he speaks more or less disrespectfully of import and export duties and custom house receipts and taxes and treaties and budgets and concessions and such truck that politics and government require and when he gets through the gomez man hops up and shakes his hand and says he s saved the country and the people you shall be rewarded says the president might i suggest another rum says wainwright cigar for me darker brand says i well sir the president sent me and wainwright back to the town in a victoria hitched to two flea bitten selling platers but the best the country afforded i found out afterward that wainwright was a regular beachcomber the smartest man on the whole coast but kept down by rum i liked him one day i inveigled him into a walk out a couple of miles from the village where there was an old grass hut on the bank of a little river while he was sitting on the grass talking beautiful of the wisdom of the world that he had learned in books i took hold of him easy and tied his hands and feet together with leather thongs that i had in my pocket lie still says i and meditate on the exigencies and irregularities of life till i get back i went to a shack in aguas frescas where a mighty wise girl named timotea carrizo lived with her mother the girl was just about as nice as you ever saw in the states she would have been called a brunette but she was better than a brunette i should say she was what you might term an ecru shade i knew her pretty well i told her about my friend wainwright she gave me a double handful of bark calisaya i think it was and some more herbs that i was to mix with it and told me what to do i was to make tea of it and give it to him and keep him from rum for a certain time and for two weeks i did it you know i liked wainwright both of us was broke but timotea sent us goat meat and plantains and tortillas every day and at last i got the curse of drink lifted from clifford wainwright he lost his taste for it and in the cool of the evening him and me would sit on the roof of timotea s mother s hut eating harmless truck like coffee and rice and stewed crabs and playing the accordion about that time president gomez found out that the advice of c wainwright was the stuff he had been looking for the country was pulling out of debt and the treasury bad enough boodle in it for him to amuse himself occasionally with the night latch the people were beginning to take their two hour siestas again every day which was the surest sign of prosperity so down from the regular capital he sends for clifford wainwright and makes him his private secretary at twenty thousand peru dollars a year yes sir so much wainwright was on the water wagon thanks to me and timotea and he was soon in clover with the government gang don t forget what done it calisaya bark with them other herbs mixed make a tea of it and give a cupful every two hours try it yourself it takes away the desire as i said a man can do a lot more for another party than he can for himself wainwright with his brains got a whole country out of trouble and on its feet but what could he do for himself and without any special brains but with some nerve and common sense i put him on his feet because i never had the weakness that he did nothing but a cigar for mine thanks and trotter paused i looked at his tattered clothes and at his deeply sunburnt hard thoughtful face didn t cartright ever offer to do anything for you i asked wainwright corrected trotter yes he offered me some pretty good jobs but i d have bad to leave aguas frescas so i didn t take any of em up say i didn t tell you much about that girl timotea we rather hit it off together she was as good as you find em anywhere spanish mostly with just a twist of lemon peel on top what if they did live in a grass hut and went bare armed a month ago went on trotter she went away i don t know where to but you d better come back to the states i insisted i can promise you positively that my brother will give you a position in cotton sugar or sheetings i am not certain which i think she went back with her mother said trotter to the village in the mountains that they come from tell me what would this job you speak of pay why said i hesitating over commerce i should say fifty or a hundred dollars a month maybe two hundred ain t it funny said trotter digging his toes in the sand what a chump a man is when it comes to paddling his own canoe i don t know of course i m not making a living here i m on the bum but well i wish you could have seen that timotea every man has his own weak spot the gig from the andador was coming ashore to take out the captain purser and myself the lone passenger i ll guarantee said i confidently that my brother will pay you seventy five dollars a month all right then said william trotter i ll but a soft voice called across the blazing sands a girl faintly lemon tinted stood in the calle real and called she was bare armed but what of that it s her said william trotter looking she s come back i m obliged but i can t take the job thanks just the same ain t it funny how we can t do nothing for ourselves but we can do wonders for the other fellow you was about to get me with your financial proposition but we ve all got our weak points timotea s mine and say trotter had turned to leave but he retraced the step or two that he had taken i like to have left you without saying good bye said he it kind of rattles you when they go away unexpected for a month and come back the same way shake hands so long say do you remember them gunshots we heard a while ago up at the cuartel well i knew what they was but i didn t mention it it was clifford wainwright being shot by a squad of soldiers against a stone wall for giving away secrets of state to that nicamala republic oh yes it was rum that did it he backslided and got his i guess we all have our weak points and can t do much toward helping ourselves mine s waiting for me i d have liked to have that job with your brother but we ve all got our weak points so long iv a big black carib carried me on his back through the surf to the ship s boat on the way the purser handed me a letter that he had brought for me at the last moment from the post office in aguas frescas it was from my brother he requested me to meet him at the st charles hotel in new orleans and accept a position with his house in either cotton sugar or sheetings and with five thousand dollars a year as my salary when i arrived at the crescent city i hurried away far away from the st charles to a dim chambre garnie in bienville street and there looking down from my attic window from time to time at the old yellow absinthe house across the street i wrote this story to buy my bread and butter can thim that helps others help thimselves the marionettes originally published in the black cat for april the short story publishing co the policeman was standing at the corner of twenty fourth street and a prodigiously dark alley near where the elevated railroad crosses the street the time was two o clock in the morning the outlook a stretch of cold drizzling unsociable blackness until the dawn a man wearing a long overcoat with his hat tilted down in front and carrying something in one hand walked softly but rapidly out of the black alley the policeman accosted him civilly but with the assured air that is linked with conscious authority the hour the alley s musty reputation the pedestrian s haste the burden he carried these easily combined into the suspicious circumstances that required illumination at the officer s hands the suspect halted readily and tilted back his hat exposing in the flicker of the electric lights an emotionless smooth countenance with a rather long nose and steady dark eyes thrusting his gloved hand into a side pocket of his overcoat he drew out a card and handed it to the policeman holding it to catch the uncertain light the officer read the name charles spencer james m d the street and number of the address were of a neighborhood so solid and respectable as to subdue even curiosity the policeman s downward glance at the article carried in the doctor s hand a handsome medicine case of black leather with small silver mountings further endorsed the guarantee of the card all right doctor said the officer stepping aside with an air of bulky affability orders are to be extra careful good many burglars and hold ups lately bad night to be out not so cold but clammy with a formal inclination of his head and a word or two corroborative of the officer s estimate of the weather doctor james continued his somewhat rapid progress three times that night had a patrolman accepted his professional card and the sight of his paragon of a medicine case as vouchers for his honesty of person and purpose had any one of those officers seen fit on the morrow to test the evidence of that card he would have found it borne out by the doctor s name on a handsome doorplate his presence calm and well dressed in his well equipped office provided it were not too early doctor james being a late riser and the testimony of the neighborhood to his good citizenship his devotion to his family and his success as a practitioner the two years he had lived among them therefore it would have much surprised any one of those zealous guardians of the peace could they have taken a peep into that immaculate medicine case upon opening it the first article to be seen would have been an elegant set of the latest conceived tools used by the box man as the ingenious safe burglar now denominates himself specially designed and constructed were the implements the short but powerful jimmy the collection of curiously fashioned keys the blued drills and punches of the finest temper capable of eating their way into chilled steel as a mouse eats into a cheese and the clamps that fasten like a leech to the polished door of a safe and pull out the combination knob as a dentist extracts a tooth in a little pouch in the inner side of the medicine case was a four ounce vial of nitroglycerine now half empty underneath the tools was a mass of crumpled banknotes and a few handfuls of gold coin the money altogether amounting to eight hundred and thirty dollars to a very limited circle of friends doctor james was known as the swell greek half of the mysterious term was a tribute to his cool and gentlemanlike manners the other half denoted in the argot of the brotherhood the leader the planner the one who by the power and prestige of his address and position secured the information upon which they based their plans and desperate enterprises of this elect circle the other members were skitsie morgan and gum decker expert box men and leopold pretzfelder a jeweller downtown who manipulated the sparklers and other ornaments collected by the working trio all good and loyal men as loose tongued as memnon and as fickle as the north star that night s work had not been considered by the firm to have yielded more than a moderate repayal for their pains an old style two story side bolt safe in the dingy office of a very wealthy old style dry goods firm on a saturday night should have excreted more than twenty five hundred dollars but that was all they found and they had divided it the three of them into equal shares upon the spot as was their custom ten or twelve thousand was what they expected but one of the proprietors had proved to be just a trifle too old style just after dark he had carried home in a shirt box most of the funds on hand doctor james proceeded up twenty fourth street which was to all appearance depopulated even the theatrical folk who affect this district as a place of residence were long since abed the drizzle had accumulated upon the street puddles of it among the stones received the fire of the arc lights and returned it shattered into a myriad liquid spangles a captious wind shower soaked and chilling coughed from the laryngeal flues between the houses as the practitioner s foot struck even with the corner of a tall brick residence of more pretension than its fellows the front door popped open and a bawling negress clattered down the steps to the pavement some medley of words came from her mouth addressed like as not to herself the recourse of her race when alone and beset by evil she looked to be one of that old vassal class of the south voluble familiar loyal irrepressible her person pictured it fat neat aproned kerchiefed this sudden apparition spewed from the silent house reached the bottom of the steps as doctor james came opposite her brain transferring its energies from sound to sight she ceased her clamor and fixed her pop eyes upon the case the doctor carried bress de lawd was the benison the sight drew from her is you a doctor suh yes i am a physician said doctor james pausing den fo god s sake come and see mister chandler suh he done had a fit or sump n he layin jist like he wuz dead miss amy sont me to git a doctor lawd knows whar old cindy d a skeared one up from

lamb miss amy lead the way said doctor james setting his foot upon the step if you want me as a doctor as an auditor i m not open to engagements the negress preceded him into the house and up a flight of thickly carpeted stairs twice they came to dimly lighted branching hallways at the second one the now panting conductress turned down a hall stopping at a door and opening it i done brought de doctor miss amy doctor james entered the room and bowed slightly to a young lady standing by the side of a bed he set his medicine case upon a chair removed his overcoat throwing it over the case and the back of the chair an advanced with quiet self possession to the bedside there lay a man sprawling as he had fallen a man dressed richly in the prevailing mode with only his shoe removed lying relaxed and as still as the dead there emanated from doctor james an aura of calm force and reserve strength that was as manna in the desert to the weak and desolate among his patrons always had women especially been attracted by something in his sick room manner it was not the indulgent suavity of the fashionable healer but a manner of poise of sureness of ability to overcome fate of deference and protection and devotion there was an exploring magnetism in his steadfast luminous brown eves a latent authority in the impassive even priestly tranquillity of his smooth countenance that outwardly fitted him for the part of confidant and consoler sometimes at his first professional visit women would tell him where they hid their diamonds at night from the burglars with the ease of much practice doctor james s unroving eyes estimated the order and quality of the room s furnishings the appointments were rich and costly the same glance had secured cognizance of the lady s appearance she was small and scarcely past twenty her face possessed the title to a winsome prettiness now obscured by you would say rather a fixed melancholy than the more violent imprint of a sudden sorrow upon her forehead above one eyebrow was a livid bruise suffered the physician s eye told him within the past six hours doctor james s fingers went to the man s wrist his almost vocal eyes questioned the lady i am mrs chandler she responded speaking with the plaintive southern slur and intonation my husband was taken suddenly ill about ten minutes before you came he has had attacks of heart trouble before some of them were very bad his clothed state and the late hour seemed to prompt her to further explanation he had been out late to a supper i believe doctor james now turned his attention to his patient in whichever of his professions he happened to be engaged he was wont to honor the case or the job with his whole interest the sick man appeared to be about thirty his countenance bore a look of boldness and dissipation but was not without a symmetry of feature and the fine lines drawn by a taste and indulgence in humor that gave the redeeming touch there was an odor of spilled wine about his clothes the physician laid back his outer garments and then with a penknife slit the shirt front from collar to waist the obstacles cleared he laid his ear to the heart and listened intently mitral regurgitation he said softly when he rose the words ended with the rising inflection of uncertainty again he listened long and this time he said mitral insufficiency with the accent of an assured diagnosis madam he began in the reassuring tones that had so often allayed anxiety there is a probability as he slowly turned his head to face the lady he saw her fall white and swooning into the arms of the old negress po lamb po lamb has dey done killed aunt cindy s own blessed child may de lawd stroy wid his wrath dem what stole her away what break dat angel heart what left lift her feet said doctor james assisting to support the drooping form where is her room she must be put to bed in here suh the woman nodded her kerchiefed head toward a door dat s miss amy s room they carried her in there and laid her on the bed her pulse was faint but regular she passed from the swoon without recovering consciousness into a profound slumber she is quite exhausted said the physician sleep

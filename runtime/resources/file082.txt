month after the president s death thus in the very moment when fortune had ceased to smile wresting from her a gift greater than the prize withdrawn of the american don frank goodwin and of his wife the natives have nothing but good to say don frank has lived among them for years and has compelled their respect his lady is easily queen of what social life the sober coast affords the wife of the governor of the district herself who was of the proud castilian family of monteleon y dolorosa de los santos y mendez feels honored to unfold her napkin with olive hued ringed hands at the table of senora goodwin were you to refer with your northern prejudices to the vivacious past of mrs goodwin when her audacious and gleeful abandon in light opera captured the mature president s fancy or to her share in that statesman s downfall and malfeasance the latin shrug of the shoulder would be your only answer and rebuttal what prejudices there were in coralio concerning senora goodwin seemed now to be in her favor whatever they had been in the past it would seem that the story is ended instead of begun that the close of tragedy and the climax of a romance have covered the ground of interest but to the more curious reader it shall be some slight instruction to trace the close threads that underlie the ingenious web of circumstances the headpiece bearing the name of president miraflores is daily scrubbed with soap bark and sand an old half breed indian tends the grave with fidelity and the dawdling minuteness of inherited sloth he chops down the weeds and ever springing grass with his machete he plucks ants and scorpions and beetles from it with his horny fingers and sprinkles its turf with water from the plaza fountain there is no grave anywhere so well kept and ordered only by following out the underlying threads will it be made clear why the old indian galves is secretly paid to keep green the grave of president miraflores by one who never saw that unfortunate statesman in life or in death and why that one was wont to walk in the twilight casting from a distance looks of gentle sadness upon that unhonored mound elsewhere than at coralio one learns of the impetuous career of isabel guilbert new orleans gave her birth and the mingled french and spanish creole nature that tinctured her life with such turbulence and warmth she had little education but a knowledge of men and motives that seemed to have come by instinct far beyond the common woman was she endowed with intrepid rashness with a love for the pursuit of adventure to the brink of danger and with desire for the pleasures of life her spirit was one to chafe under any curb she was eve after the fall but before the bitterness of it was felt she wore life as a rose in her bosom of the legion of men who had been at her feet it was said that but one was so fortunate as to engage her fancy to president miraflores the brilliant but unstable ruler of anchuria she yielded the key to her resolute heart how then do we find her as the coralians would have told you the wife of frank goodwin and happily living a life of dull and dreamy inaction the underlying threads reach far stretching across the sea following them out it will be made plain why shorty o day of the columbia detective agency resigned his position and for a lighter pastime it shall be a duty and a pleasing sport to wander with momus beneath the tropic stars where melpomene once stalked austere now to cause laughter to echo from those lavish jungles and frowing crags where formerly rang the cries of pirate s victims to lay aside pike and cutlass and attack with quip and jollity to draw one saving titter of mirth from the rusty casque of romance this were pleasant to do in the shade of the lemon trees on that coast that is curved like lips set for smiling for there are yet tales of the spanish main that segment of continent washed by the tempestuous caribbean and presenting to the sea a formidable border of tropicle jungle topped by the overweening cordilleras is still begirt by mystery and romance in past times buccaneers and revolutionists roused the echoes of its cliffs and the condor wheeled perpetually above where in the green groves they made food for him with their matchlocks and toledos taken and retaken by sea rovers by adverse powers and by sudden uprising of rebellious factions the historic miles of adventurous coast has scarcely known for hundreds of years whom rightly to call its master pizarro balboa sir francis drake and bolivar did what they could to make it a part of christendom sir john morgan lafitte and other eminent swashbucklers bombarded and pounded it in the name of abaddon the game still goes on the guns of the rovers are silenced but the tintype man the enlarged photograph brigand the kodaking tourist and the scouts of the gentle brigade of fakirs have found it out and carry on the work the hucksters of germany france and sicily now bag in small change across their counters gentlemen adventurers throng the waiting rooms of its rulers with proposals for railways and concessions the little opera bouffe nations play at government and intrigue until some day a big silent gunboat glides into the offing and warns them not to break their toys and with these changes comes also the small adventurer with empty pockets to fill light of heart busy brained the modern fairy prince bearing an alarm clock with which more surely than by the sentimental kiss to awaken the beautiful tropics from their centuries sleep generally he wears a shamrock which he matches pridefully against the extravagant palms

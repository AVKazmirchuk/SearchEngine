girl s story of insufficient wages further reduced by fines that go to swell the store s profits of time lost through illness and then of lost positions lost hope and the knock of the adventurer upon the green door but to rudolf the history sounded as big as the iliad or the crisis in junie s love test to think of you going through all that he exclaimed it was something fierce said the girl solemnly and you have no relatives or friends in the city none whatever i am all alone in the world too said rudolf after a pause i am glad of that said the girl promptly and somehow it pleased the young man to hear that she approved of his bereft condition very suddenly her eyelids dropped and she sighed deeply i m awfully sleepy she said and i feel so good then rudolf rose and took his hat i ll say good night a long night s sleep will be fine for you he held out his hand and she took it and said good night but her eyes asked a question so eloquently so frankly and pathetically that he answered it with words oh i m coming back to morrow to see how you are getting along you can t get rid of me so easily then at the door as though the way of his coming had been so much less important than the fact that he had come she asked how did you come to knock at my door he looked at her for a moment remembering the cards and felt a sudden jealous pain what if they had fallen into other hands as adventurous as his quickly he decided that she must never know the truth he would never let her know that he was aware of the strange expedient to which she had been driven by her great distress one of our piano tuners lives in this house he said i knocked at your door by mistake the last thing he saw in the room before the green door closed was her smile at the head of the stairway he paused and looked curiously about him and then he went along the hallway to its other end and coming back ascended to the floor above and continued his puzzled explorations every door that he found in the house was painted green wondering he descended to the sidewalk the fantastic african was still there rudolf confronted him with his two cards in his hand will you tell me why you gave me these cards and what they mean he asked in a broad good natured grin the negro exhibited a splendid advertisement of his master s profession dar it is boss he said pointing down the street but i spect you is a little late for de fust act looking the way he pointed rudolf saw above the entrance to a theatre the blazing electric sign of its new play the green door i m informed dat it s a fust rate show sah said the negro de agent what represents it pussented me with a dollar sah to distribute a few of his cards along with de doctah s may i offer you one of de doctah s cards sah at the corner of the block in which he lived rudolf stopped for a glass of beer and a cigar when he had come out with his lighted weed he buttoned his coat pushed back his hat and said stoutly to the lamp post on the corner all the same i believe it was the hand of fate that doped out the way for me to find her which conclusion under the circumstances certainly admits rudolf steiner to the ranks of the true followers of romance and adventure from the cabby s seat the cabby has his point of view it is more single minded perhaps than that of a follower of any other calling from the high swaying seat of his hansom he looks upon his fellow men as nomadic particles of no account except when possessed of migratory desires he is jehu and you are goods in transit be you president or vagabond to cabby you are only a fare he takes you up cracks his whip joggles your vertebrae and sets you down when time for payment arrives if you exhibit a familiarity with legal rates you come to know what contempt is if you find that you have left your pocketbook behind you are made to realise the mildness of dante s imagination it is not an extravagant theory that the cabby s singleness of purpose and concentrated view of life are the results of the hansom s peculiar construction the cock of the roost sits aloft like jupiter on an unsharable seat holding your fate between two thongs of inconstant leather helpless ridiculous confined bobbing like a toy mandarin you sit like a rat in a trap you before whom butlers cringe on solid land and must squeak upward through a slit in your peripatetic sarcophagus to make your feeble wishes known then in a cab you are not even an occupant you are contents you are a cargo at sea and the cherub that sits up aloft has davy jones s street and number by heart one night there were sounds of revelry in the big brick tenement house next door but one to mcgary s family cafe the sounds seemed to emanate from the apartments of the walsh family the sidewalk was obstructed by an assortment of interested neighbours who opened a lane from time to time for a hurrying messenger bearing from mcgary s goods pertinent to festivity and diversion the sidewalk contingent was engaged in comment and discussion from which it made no effort to eliminate the news that norah walsh was being married in the fulness of time there was an eruption of the merry makers to the sidewalk the uninvited guests enveloped and permeated them and upon the night air rose joyous cries congratulations laughter and unclassified noises born of mcgary s oblations to the hymeneal scene close to the curb stood jerry o donovan s cab night hawk was jerry called but no more lustrous or cleaner hansom than his ever closed its doors upon point lace and november violets and jerry s horse i am within bounds when i tell you that he was stuffed with oats until one of those old ladies who leave their dishes unwashed at home and go about having expressmen arrested would have smiled yes smiled to have seen him among the shifting sonorous pulsing crowd glimpses could be had of jerry s high hat battered by the winds and rains of many years of his nose like a carrot battered by the frolicsome athletic progeny of millionaires and by contumacious fares of his brass buttoned green coat admired in the vicinity of mcgary s it was plain that jerry had usurped the functions of his cab and was carrying a load indeed the figure may be extended and he be likened to a bread waggon if we admit the testimony of a youthful spectator who was heard to remark jerry has got a bun from somewhere among the throng in the street or else out of the thin stream of pedestrians a young woman tripped and stood by the cab the professional hawk s eye of jerry caught the movement he made a lurch for the cab overturning three or four onlookers and himself no he caught the cap of a water plug and kept his feet like a sailor shinning up the ratlins during a squall jerry mounted to his professional seat once he was there mcgary s liquids were baffled he seesawed on the mizzenmast of his craft as safe as a steeple jack rigged to the flagpole of a skyscraper step in lady said jerry gathering his lines the young woman stepped into the cab the doors shut with a bang jerry s whip cracked in the air the crowd in the gutter scattered and the fine hansom dashed away crosstown when the oat spry horse had hedged a little his first spurt of speed jerry broke the lid of his cab and called down through the aperture in the voice of a cracked megaphone trying to please where now will ye be drivin to anywhere you please came up the answer musical and contented tis drivin for pleasure she is thought jerry and then he suggested as a matter of course take a thrip around in the park lady twill be ilegant cool and fine just as you like answered the fare pleasantly the cab headed for fifth avenue and sped up that perfect street jerry bounced and swayed in his seat the potent fluids of mcgary were disquieted and they sent new fumes to his head he sang an ancient song of killisnook and brandished his whip like a baton inside the cab the fare sat up straight on the cushions looking to right and left at the lights and houses even in the shadowed hansom her eyes shone like stars at twilight when they reached fifty ninth street jerry s head was bobbing and his reins were slack but his horse turned in through the park gate and began the old familiar nocturnal round and then the fare leaned back entranced and breathed deep the clean wholesome odours of grass and leaf and bloom and the wise beast in the shafts knowing his ground struck into his by the hour gait and kept to the right of the road habit also struggled successfully against jerry s increasing torpor he raised the hatch of his storm tossed vessel and made the inquiry that cabbies do make in the park like shtop at the cas sino lady gezzer r freshm s n lish n the music ev body shtops i think that would be nice said the fare they reined up with a plunge at the casino entrance the cab doors flew open the fare stepped directly upon the floor at once she was caught in a web of ravishing music and dazzled by a panorama of lights and colours some one slipped a little square card into her hand on which was printed a number she looked around and saw her cab twenty yards away already lining up in its place among the waiting mass of carriages cabs and motor cars and then a man who seemed to be all shirt front danced backward before her and next she was seated at a little table by a railing over which climbed a jessamine vine there seemed to be a wordless invitation to purchase she consulted a collection of small coins in a thin purse and received from them license to order a glass of beer there she sat inhaling and absorbing it all the new coloured new shaped life in a fairy palace in an enchanted wood at fifty tables sat princes and queens clad in all the silks and gems of the world and now and then one of them would look curiously at jerry s fare they saw a plain figure dressed in a pink silk of the kind that is tempered by the word foulard and a plain face that wore a look of love of life that the queens envied twice the long hands of the clocks went round royalties thinned from their al fresco thrones and buzzed or clattered away in their vehicles of state the music retired into cases of wood and bags of leather and baize waiters removed cloths pointedly near the plain figure sitting almost alone jerry s fare rose and held out her numbered card simply is there anything coming on the ticket she asked a waiter told her it was her cab check and that she should give it to the man at the entrance this man took it and called the number only three hansoms stood in line the driver of one of them went and routed out jerry asleep in his cab he swore deeply climbed to the captain s bridge and steered his craft to the pier his fare entered and the cab whirled into the cool fastnesses of the park along the shortest homeward cuts at the gate a glimmer of reason in the form of sudden suspicion seized upon jerry s beclouded mind one or two things occurred to him he stopped his horse raised the trap and dropped his phonographic voice like a lead plummet through the aperture i want to see four dollars before goin any further on th thrip have ye got th dough four dollars laughed the fare softly dear me no i ve only got a few pennies and a dime or two jerry shut down the trap and slashed his oat fed horse the clatter of hoofs strangled but could not drown the sound of his profanity he shouted choking and gurgling curses at the starry heavens he cut viciously with his whip at passing vehicles he scattered fierce and ever changing oaths and imprecations along the streets so that a late truck driver crawling homeward heard and was abashed but he knew his recourse and made for it at a gallop at the house with the green lights beside the steps he pulled up he flung wide the cab doors and tumbled heavily to the ground come on you he said roughly his fare came forth with the casino dreamy smile still on her plain face jerry took her by the arm and led her into the police station a gray moustached sergeant looked keenly across the desk he and the cabby were no strangers sargeant began jerry in his old raucous martyred thunderous tones of complaint i ve got a fare here that jerry paused he drew a knotted red hand across his brow the fog set up by mcgary was beginning to clear away a fare sargeant he continued with a grin that i want to inthroduce to ye it s me wife that i married at ould man walsh s this avening and a divil of a time we had tis thrue shake hands wid th sargeant norah and we ll be off to home before stepping into the cab norah sighed profoundly i ve had such a nice time jerry said she an unfinished story we no longer groan and heap ashes upon our heads when the flames of tophet are mentioned for even the preachers have begun to tell us that god is radium or ether or some scientific compound and that the worst we wicked ones may expect is a chemical reaction this is a pleasing hypothesis but there lingers yet some of the old goodly terror of orthodoxy there are but two subjects upon which one may discourse with a free imagination and without the possibility of being controverted you may talk of your dreams and you may tell what you heard a parrot say both morpheus and the bird are incompetent witnesses and your listener dare not attack your recital the baseless fabric of a vision then shall furnish my theme chosen with apologies and regrets instead of the more limited field of pretty polly s small talk i had a dream that was so far removed from the higher criticism that it had to do with the ancient respectable and lamented bar of judgment theory gabriel had played his trump and those of us who could not follow suit were arraigned for examination i noticed at one side a gathering of professional bondsmen in solemn black and collars that buttoned behind but it seemed there was some trouble about their real estate titles and they did not appear to be getting any of us out a fly cop an angel policeman flew over to me and took me by the left wing near at hand was a group of very prosperous looking spirits arraigned for judgment do you belong with that bunch the policeman asked who are they was my answer why said he they are but this irrelevant stuff is taking up space that the story should occupy dulcie worked in a department store she sold hamburg edging or stuffed peppers or automobiles or other little trinkets such as they keep in department stores of what she earned dulcie received six dollars per week the remainder was credited to her and debited to somebody else s account in the ledger kept by g oh primal energy you say reverend doctor well then in the ledger of primal energy during her first year in the store dulcie was paid five dollars per week it would be instructive to know how she lived on that amount don t care very well probably you are interested in larger amounts six dollars is a larger amount i will tell you how she lived on six dollars per week one afternoon at six when dulcie was sticking her hat pin within an eighth of an inch of her medulla oblongata she said to her chum sadie the girl that waits on you with her left side say sade i made a date for dinner this evening with piggy you never did exclaimed sadie admiringly well ain t you the lucky one piggy s an awful swell and he always takes a girl to swell places he took blanche up to the hoffman house one evening where they have swell music and you see a lot of swells you ll have a swell time dulce dulcie hurried homeward her eyes were shining and her cheeks showed the delicate pink of life s real life s approaching dawn it was friday and she had fifty cents left of her last week s wages the streets were filled with the rush hour floods of people the electric lights of broadway were glowing calling moths from miles from leagues from hundreds of leagues out of darkness around to come in and attend the singeing school men in accurate clothes with faces like those carved on cherry stones by the old salts in sailors homes turned and stared at dulcie as she sped unheeding past them manhattan the night blooming cereus was beginning to unfold its dead white heavy odoured petals dulcie stopped in a store where goods were cheap and bought an imitation lace collar with her fifty cents that money was to have been spent otherwise fifteen cents for supper ten cents for breakfast ten cents for lunch another dime was to be added to her small store of savings and five cents was to be squandered for licorice drops the kind that made your cheek look like the toothache and last as long the licorice was an extravagance almost a carouse but what is life without pleasures dulcie lived in a furnished room there is this difference between a furnished room and a boardinghouse in a furnished room other people do not know it when you go hungry dulcie went up to her room the third floor back in a west side brownstone front she lit the gas scientists tell us that the diamond is the hardest substance known their mistake landladies know of a compound beside which the diamond is as putty they pack it in the tips of gas burners and one may stand on a chair and dig at it in vain until one s fingers are pink and bruised a hairpin will not remove it therefore let us call it immovable so dulcie lit the gas in its one fourth candlepower glow we will observe the room couch bed dresser table washstand chair of this much the landlady was guilty the rest was dulcie s on the dresser were her treasures a gilt china vase presented to her by sadie a calendar issued by a pickle works a book on the divination of dreams some rice powder in a glass dish and a cluster of artificial cherries tied with a pink ribbon against the wrinkly mirror stood pictures of general kitchener william muldoon the duchess of marlborough and benvenuto cellini against one wall was a plaster of paris plaque of an o callahan in a roman helmet near it was a violent oleograph of a lemon coloured child assaulting an inflammatory butterfly this was dulcie s final judgment in art but it had never been upset her rest had never been disturbed by whispers of stolen copes no critic had elevated his eyebrows at her infantile entomologist piggy was to call for her at seven while she swiftly makes ready let us discreetly face the other way and gossip for the room dulcie paid two dollars per week on week days her breakfast cost ten cents she made coffee and cooked an egg over the gaslight while she was dressing on sunday mornings she feasted royally on veal chops and pineapple fritters at billy s restaurant at a cost of twenty five cents and tipped the waitress ten cents new york presents so many temptations for one to run into extravagance she had her lunches in the department store restaurant at a cost of sixty cents for the week dinners were the evening papers show me a new yorker going without his daily paper came to six cents and two sunday papers one for the personal column and the other to read were ten cents the total amounts to now one has to buy clothes and i give it up i hear of wonderful bargains in fabrics and of miracles performed with needle and thread but i am in doubt i hold my pen poised in vain when i would add to dulcie s life some of those joys that belong to woman by virtue of all the unwritten sacred natural inactive ordinances of the equity of heaven twice she had been to coney island and had ridden the hobby horses tis a weary thing to count your pleasures by summers instead of by hours piggy needs but a word when the girls named him an undeserving stigma was cast upon the noble family of swine the words of three letters lesson in the old blue spelling book begins with piggy s biography he was fat he had the soul of a rat the habits of a bat and the magnanimity of a cat he wore expensive clothes and was a connoisseur in starvation he could look at a shop girl and tell you to an hour how long it had been since she had eaten anything more nourishing than marshmallows and tea he hung about the shopping districts and prowled around in department stores with his invitations to dinner men who escort dogs upon the streets at the end of a string look down upon him he is a type i can dwell upon him no longer my pen is not the kind intended for him i am no carpenter at ten minutes to seven dulcie was ready she looked at herself in the wrinkly mirror the reflection was satisfactory the dark blue dress fitting without a wrinkle the hat with its jaunty black feather the but slightly soiled gloves all representing self denial even of food itself were vastly becoming dulcie forgot everything else for a moment except that she was beautiful and that life was about to lift a corner of its mysterious veil for her to observe its wonders no gentleman had ever asked her out before now she was going for a brief moment into the glitter and exalted show the girls said that piggy was a spender there would be a grand dinner and music and splendidly dressed ladies to look at and things to eat that strangely twisted the girls jaws when they tried to tell about them no doubt she would be asked out again there was a blue pongee suit in a window that she knew by saving twenty cents a week instead of ten in let s see oh it would run into years but there was a second hand store in seventh avenue where somebody knocked at the door dulcie opened it the landlady stood there with a spurious smile sniffing for cooking by stolen gas a gentleman s downstairs to see you she said name is mr wiggins by such epithet was piggy known to unfortunate ones who had to take him seriously dulcie turned to the dresser to get her handkerchief and then she stopped still and bit her underlip hard while looking in her mirror she had seen fairyland and herself a princess just awakening from a long slumber she had forgotten one that was watching her with sad beautiful stern eyes the only one there was to approve or condemn what she did straight and slender and tall with a look of sorrowful reproach on his handsome melancholy face general kitchener fixed his wonderful eyes on her out of his gilt photograph frame on the dresser dulcie turned like an automatic doll to the landlady tell him i can t go she said dully tell him i m sick or something tell him i m not going out after the door was closed and locked dulcie fell upon her bed crushing her black tip and cried for ten minutes general kitchener was her only friend he was dulcie s ideal of a gallant knight he looked as if he might have a secret sorrow and his wonderful moustache was a dream and she was a little afraid of that stern yet tender look in his eyes she used to have little fancies that he would call at the house sometime and ask for her with his sword clanking against his high boots once when a boy was rattling a piece of chain against a lamp post she had opened the window and looked out but there was no use she knew that general kitchener was away over in japan leading his army against the savage turks and he would never step out of his gilt frame for her yet one look from him had vanquished piggy that night yes for that night when her cry was over dulcie got up and took off her best dress and put on her old blue kimono she wanted no dinner she sang two verses of sammy then she became intensely interested in a little red speck on the side of her nose and after that was attended to she drew up a chair to the rickety table and told her fortune with an old deck of cards the horrid impudent thing she said aloud and i never gave him a word or a look to make him think it at nine o clock dulcie took a tin box of crackers and a little pot of raspberry jam out of her trunk and had a feast she offered general kitchener some jam on a cracker but he only looked at her as the sphinx would have looked at a butterfly if there are butterflies in the desert don t eat it if you don t want to said dulcie and don t put on so many airs and scold so with your eyes i wonder if you d he so superior and snippy if you had to live on six dollars a week it was not a good sign for dulcie to be rude to general kitchener and then she turned benvenuto cellini face downward with a severe gesture but that was not inexcusable for she had always thought he was henry viii and she did not approve of him at half past nine dulcie took a last look at the pictures on the dresser turned out the light and skipped into bed it s an awful thing to go to bed with a good night look at general kitchener william muldoon the duchess of marlborough and benvenuto cellini this story really doesn t get anywhere at all the rest of it comes later sometime when piggy asks dulcie again to dine with him and she is feeling lonelier than usual and general kitchener happens to be looking the other way and then as i said before i dreamed that i was standing near a crowd of prosperous looking angels and a policeman took me by the wing and asked if i belonged with them who are they i asked why said he they are the men who hired working girls and paid em five or six dollars a week to live on are you one of the bunch not on your immortality said i i m only the fellow that set fire to an orphan asylum and murdered a blind man for his pennies the caliph cupid and the clock prince michael of the electorate of valleluna sat on his favourite bench in the park the coolness of the september night quickened the life in him like a rare tonic wine the benches were not filled for park loungers with their stagnant blood are prompt to detect and fly home from the crispness of early autumn the moon was just clearing the roofs of the range of dwellings that bounded the quadrangle on the east children laughed and played about the fine sprayed fountain in the shadowed spots fauns and hamadryads wooed unconscious of the gaze of mortal eyes a hand organ philomel by the grace of our stage carpenter fancy fluted and droned in a side street around the enchanted boundaries of the little park street cars spat and mewed and the stilted trains roared like tigers and lions prowling for a place to enter and above the trees shone the great round shining face of an illuminated clock in the tower of an antique public building prince michael s shoes were wrecked far beyond the skill of the carefullest cobbler the ragman would have declined any negotiations concerning his clothes the two weeks stubble on his face was grey and brown and red and greenish yellow as if it had been made up from individual contributions from the chorus of a musical comedy no man existed who had money enough to wear so bad a hat as his prince michael sat on his favourite bench and smiled it was a diverting thought to him that he was wealthy enough to buy every one of those close ranged bulky window lit mansions that faced him if he chose he could have matched gold equipages jewels art treasures estates and acres with any croesus in this proud city of manhattan and scarcely have entered upon the bulk of his holdings he could have sat at table with reigning sovereigns the social world the world of art the fellowship of the elect adulation imitation the homage of the fairest honours from the highest praise from the wisest flattery esteem credit pleasure fame all the honey of life was waiting in the comb in the hive of the world for prince michael of the electorate of valleluna whenever he might choose to take it but his choice was to sit in rags and dinginess on a bench in a park for he had tasted of the fruit of the tree of life and finding it bitter in his mouth had stepped out of eden for a time to seek distraction close to the unarmoured beating heart of the world these thoughts strayed dreamily through the mind of prince michael as he smiled under the stubble of his polychromatic beard lounging thus clad as the poorest of mendicants in the parks he loved to study humanity he found in altruism more pleasure than his riches his station and all the grosser sweets of life had given him it was his chief solace and satisfaction to alleviate individual distress to confer favours upon worthy ones who had need of succour to dazzle unfortunates by unexpected and bewildering gifts of truly royal magnificence bestowed however with wisdom and judiciousness and as prince michael s eye rested upon the glowing face of the great clock in the tower his smile altruistic as it was became slightly tinged with contempt big thoughts were the prince s and it was always with a shake of his head that he considered the subjugation of the world to the arbitrary measures of time the comings and goings of people in hurry and dread controlled by the little metal moving hands of a clock always made him sad by and by came a young man in evening clothes and sat upon the third bench from the prince for half an hour he smoked cigars with nervous haste and then he fell to watching the face of the illuminated clock above the trees his perturbation was evident and the prince noted in sorrow that its cause was connected in some manner with the slowly moving hands of the timepiece his highness arose and went to the young man s bench i beg your pardon for addressing you he said but i perceive that you are disturbed in mind if it may serve to mitigate the liberty i have taken i will add that i am prince michael heir to the throne of the electorate of valleluna i appear incognito of course as you may gather from my appearance it is a fancy of mine to render aid to others whom i think worthy of it perhaps the matter that seems to distress you is one that would more readily yield to our mutual efforts the young man looked up brightly at the prince brightly but the perpendicular line of perplexity between his brows was not smoothed away he laughed and even then it did not but he accepted the momentary diversion glad to meet you prince he said good humouredly yes i d say you were incog all right thanks for your offer of assistance but i don t see where your butting in would help things any it s a kind of private affair you know but thanks all the same prince michael sat at the young man s side he was often rebuffed but never offensively his courteous manner and words forbade that clocks said the prince are shackles on the feet of mankind i have observed you looking persistently at that clock its face is that of a tyrant its numbers are false as those on a lottery ticket its hands are those of a bunco steerer who makes an appointment with you to your ruin let me entreat you to throw off its humiliating bonds and to cease to order your affairs by that insensate monitor of brass and steel i don t usually said the young man i carry a watch except when i ve got my radiant rags on i know human nature as i do the trees and grass said the prince with earnest dignity i am a master of philosophy a graduate in art and i hold the purse of a fortunatus there are few mortal misfortunes that i cannot alleviate or overcome i have read your countenance and found in it honesty and nobility as well as distress i beg of you to accept my advice or aid do not belie the intelligence i see in your face by judging from my appearance of my ability to defeat your troubles the young man glanced at the clock again and frowned darkly when his gaze strayed from the glowing horologue of time it rested intently upon a four story red brick house in the row of dwellings opposite to where he sat the shades were drawn and the lights in many rooms shone dimly through them ten minutes to nine exclaimed the young man with an impatient gesture of despair he turned his back upon the house and took a rapid step or two in a contrary direction remain commanded prince michael in so potent a voice that the disturbed one wheeled around with a somewhat chagrined laugh i ll give her the ten minutes and then i m off he muttered and then aloud to the prince i ll join you in confounding all clocks my friend and throw in women too sit down said the prince calmly i do not accept your addition women are the natural enemies of clocks and therefore the allies of those who would seek liberation from these monsters that measure our follies and limit our pleasures if you will so far confide in me i would ask you to relate to me your story the young man threw himself upon the bench with a reckless laugh your royal highness i will he said in tones of mock deference do you see yonder house the one with three upper windows lighted well at o clock i stood in that house with the young lady i am that is i was engaged to i had been doing wrong my dear prince i had been a naughty boy and she had heard of it i wanted to be forgiven of course we are always wanting women to forgive us aren t we prince i want time to think it over said she there is one thing certain i will either fully forgive you or i will never see your face again there will be no half way business at half past eight she said at exactly half past eight you may be watching the middle upper window of the top floor if i decide to forgive i will hang out of that window a white silk scarf you will know by that that all is as was before and you may come to me if you see no scarf you may consider that everything between us is ended forever that concluded the young man bitterly is why i have been watching that clock the time for the signal to appear has passed twenty three minutes ago do you wonder that i am a little disturbed my prince of rags and whiskers let me repeat to you said prince michael in his even well modulated tones that women are the natural enemies of clocks clocks are an evil women a blessing the signal may yet appear never on your principality exclaimed the young man hopelessly you don t know marian of course she s always on time to the minute that was the first thing about her that attracted me i ve got the mitten instead of the scarf i ought to have known at that my goose was cooked i ll go west on the to night with jack milburn the jig s up i ll try jack s ranch awhile and top off with the klondike and whiskey good night er er prince prince michael smiled his enigmatic gentle comprehending smile and caught the coat sleeve of the other the brilliant light in the prince s eyes was softening to a dreamier cloudy translucence wait he said solemnly till the clock strikes i have wealth and power and knowledge above most men but when the clock strikes i am afraid stay by me until then this woman shall be yours you have the word of the hereditary prince of valleluna on the day of your marriage i will give you and a palace on the hudson but there must be no clocks in that palace they measure our follies and limit our pleasures do you agree to that of course said the young man cheerfully they re a nuisance anyway always ticking and striking and getting you late for dinner he glanced again at the clock in the tower the hands stood at three minutes to nine i think said prince michael that i will sleep a little the day has been fatiguing he stretched himself upon a bench with the manner of one who had slept thus before you will find me in this park on any evening when the weather is suitable said the prince sleepily come to me when your marriage day is set and i will give you a cheque for the money thanks your highness said the young man seriously it doesn t look as if i would need that palace on the hudson but i appreciate your offer just the same prince michael sank into deep slumber his battered hat rolled from the bench to the ground the young man lifted it placed it over the frowsy face and moved one of the grotesquely relaxed limbs into a more comfortable position poor devil he said as he drew the tattered clothes closer about the prince s breast sonorous and startling came the stroke of from the clock tower the young man sighed again turned his face for one last look at the house of his relinquished hopes and cried aloud profane words of holy rapture from the middle upper window blossomed in the dusk a waving snowy fluttering wonderful divine emblem of forgiveness and promised joy by came a citizen rotund comfortable home hurrying unknowing of the delights of waving silken scarfs on the borders of dimly lit parks will you oblige me with the time sir asked the young man and the citizen shrewdly conjecturing his watch to be safe dragged it out and announced twenty nine and a half minutes past eight sir and then from habit he glanced at the clock in the tower and made further oration by george that clock s half an hour fast first time in ten years i ve known it to be off this watch of mine never varies a but the citizen was talking to vacancy he turned and saw his hearer a fast receding black shadow flying in the direction of a house with three lighted upper windows and in the morning came along two policemen on their way to the beats they owned the park was deserted save for one dilapidated figure that sprawled asleep on a bench they stopped and gazed upon it it s dopy mike said one he hits the pipe every night park bum for twenty years on his last legs i guess the other policeman stooped and looked at something crumpled and crisp in the hand of the sleeper gee he remarked he s doped out a fifty dollar bill anyway wish i knew the brand of hop that he smokes and then rap rap rap went the club of realism against the shoe soles of prince michael of the electorate of valleluna sisters of the golden circle the rubberneck auto was about ready to start the merry top riders had been assigned to their seats by the gentlemanly conductor the sidewalk was blockaded with sightseers who had gathered to stare at sightseers justifying the natural law that every creature on earth is preyed upon by some other creature the megaphone man raised his instrument of torture the inside of the great automobile began to thump and throb like the heart of a coffee drinker the top riders nervously clung to the seats the old lady from

williams of cloverdale missouri and his bride capitalise it friend typo that last word word of words in the epiphany of life and love the scent of the flowers the booty of the bee the primal drip of spring waters the overture of the lark the twist of lemon peel on the cocktail of creation such is the bride holy is the wife revered the mother galliptious is the summer girl but the bride is the certified check among the wedding presents that the gods send in when man is married to mortality the car glided up the golden way on the bridge of the great cruiser the captain stood trumpeting the sights of the big city to his passengers wide mouthed and open eared they heard the sights of the metropolis thundered forth to their eyes confused delirious with excitement and provincial longings they tried to make ocular responses to the megaphonic ritual in the solemn spires of spreading cathedrals they saw the home of the vanderbilts in the busy bulk of the grand central depot they viewed wonderingly the frugal cot of russell sage bidden to observe the highlands of the hudson they gaped unsuspecting at the upturned mountains of a new laid sewer to many the elevated railroad was the rialto on the stations of which uniformed men sat and made chop suey of your tickets and to this day in the outlying districts many have it that chuck connors with his hand on his heart leads reform and that but for the noble municipal efforts of one parkhurst a district attorney the notorious bishop potter gang would have destroyed law and order from the bowery to the harlem river but i beg you to observe mrs james williams hattie chalmers that was once the belle of cloverdale pale blue is the bride s if she will and this colour she had honoured willingly had the moss rosebud loaned to her cheeks of its pink and as for the violet her eyes will do very well as they are thank you a useless strip of white chaf oh no he was guiding the auto car of white chiffon or perhaps it was grenadine or tulle was tied beneath her chin pretending to hold her bonnet in place but you know as well as i do that the hatpins did the work and on mrs james williams s face was recorded a little library of the world s best thoughts in three volumes volume no contained the belief that james williams was about the right sort of thing volume no was an essay on the world declaring it to be a very excellent place volume no disclosed the belief that in occupying the highest seat in a rubberneck auto they were travelling the pace that passes all understanding james williams you would have guessed was about twenty four it will gratify you to know that your estimate was so accurate he was exactly twenty three years eleven months and twenty nine days old he was well built active strong jawed good natured and rising he was on his wedding trip dear kind fairy please cut out those orders for money and h p touring cars and fame and a new growth of hair and the presidency of the boat club instead of any of them turn backward oh turn backward and give us just a teeny weeny bit of our wedding trip over again just an hour dear fairy so we can remember how the grass and poplar trees looked and the bow of those bonnet strings tied beneath her chin even if it was the hatpins that did the work can t do it very well hurry up with that touring car and the oil stock then just in front of mrs james williams sat a girl in a loose tan jacket and a straw hat adorned with grapes and roses only in dreams and milliners shops do we alas gather grapes and roses at one swipe this girl gazed with large blue eyes credulous when the megaphone man roared his doctrine that millionaires were things about which we should be concerned between blasts she resorted to epictetian philosophy in the form of pepsin chewing gum at this girl s right hand sat a young man about twenty four he was well built active strong jawed and good natured but if his description seems to follow that of james williams divest it of anything cloverdalian this man belonged to hard streets and sharp corners he looked keenly about him seeming to begrudge the asphalt under the feet of those upon whom he looked down from his perch while the megaphone barks at a famous hostelry let me whisper you through the low tuned cardiaphone to sit tight for now things are about to happen and the great city will close over them again as over a scrap of ticker tape floating down from the den of a broad street bear the girl in the tan jacket twisted around to view the pilgrims on the last seat the other passengers she had absorbed the seat behind her was her bluebeard s chamber her eyes met those of mrs james williams between two ticks of a watch they exchanged their life s experiences histories hopes and fancies and all mind you with the eye before two men could have decided whether to draw steel or borrow a match the bride leaned forward low she and the girl spoke rapidly together their tongues moving quickly like those of two serpents a comparison that is not meant to go further two smiles and a dozen nods closed the conference and now in the broad quiet avenue in front of the rubberneck car a man in dark clothes stood with uplifted hand from the sidewalk another hurried to join him the girl in the fruitful hat quickly seized her companion by the arm and whispered in his ear that young man exhibited proof of ability to act promptly crouching low he slid over the edge of the car hung lightly for an instant and then disappeared half a dozen of the top riders observed his feat wonderingly but made no comment deeming it prudent not to express surprise at what might be the conventional manner of alighting in this bewildering city the truant passenger dodged a hansom and then floated past like a leaf on a stream between a furniture van and a florist s delivery wagon the girl in the tan jacket turned again and looked in the eyes of mrs james williams then she faced about and sat still while the rubberneck auto stopped at the flash of the badge under the coat of the plainclothes man what s eatin you demanded the megaphonist abandoning his professional discourse for pure english keep her at anchor for a minute ordered the officer there s a man on board we want a philadelphia burglar called pinky mcguire there he is on the back seat look out for the side donovan donovan went to the hind wheel and looked up at james williams come down old sport he said pleasantly we ve got you back to sleepytown for yours it ain t a bad idea hidin on a rubberneck though i ll remember that softly through the megaphone came the advice of the conductor better step off sir and explain the car must proceed on its tour james williams belonged among the level heads with necessary slowness he picked his way through the passengers down to the steps at the front of the car his wife followed but she first turned her eyes and saw the escaped tourist glide from behind the furniture van and slip behind a tree on the edge of the little park not fifty feet away descended to the ground james williams faced his captors with a smile he was thinking what a good story he would have to tell in cloverdale about having been mistaken for a burglar the rubberneck coach lingered out of respect for its patrons what could be a more interesting sight than this my name is james williams of cloverdale missouri he said kindly so that they would not be too greatly mortified i have letters here that will show you ll come with us please announced the plainclothes man pinky mcguire s description fits you like flannel washed in hot suds a detective saw you on the rubberneck up at central park and phoned down to take you in do your explaining at the station house james williams s wife his bride of two weeks looked him in the face with a strange soft radiance in her eyes and a flush on her cheeks looked him in the face and said go with em quietly pinky and maybe it ll be in your favour and then as the glaring at gotham car rolled away she turned and threw a kiss his wife threw a kiss at some one high up on the seats of the rubberneck your girl gives you good advice mcguire said donovan come on now and then madness descended upon and occupied james williams he pushed his hat far upon the back of his head my wife seems to think i am a burglar he said recklessly i never heard of her being crazy therefore i must be and if i m crazy they can t do anything to me for killing you two fools in my madness whereupon he resisted arrest so cheerfully and industriously that cops had to be whistled for and afterwards the reserves to disperse a few thousand delighted spectators at the station house the desk sergeant asked for his name mcdoodle the pink or pinky the brute i forget which was james williams s answer but you can bet i m a burglar don t leave that out and you might add that it took five of em to pluck the pink i d especially like to have that in the records in an hour came mrs james williams with uncle thomas of madison avenue in a respect compelling motor car and proofs of the hero s innocence for all the world like the third act of a drama backed by an automobile mfg co after the police had sternly reprimanded james williams for imitating a copyrighted burglar and given him as honourable a discharge as the department was capable of mrs williams rearrested him and swept him into an angle of the station house james williams regarded her with one eye he always said that donovan closed the other while somebody was holding his good right hand never before had he given her a word of reproach or of reproof if you can explain he began rather stiffly why you dear she interrupted listen it was an hour s pain and trial to you i did it for her i mean the girl who spoke to me on the coach i was so happy jim so happy with you that i didn t dare to refuse that happiness to another jim they were married only this morning those two and i wanted him to get away while they were struggling with you i saw him slip from behind his tree and hurry across the park that s all of it dear i had to do it thus does one sister of the plain gold band know another who stands in the enchanted light that shines but once and briefly for each one by rice and satin bows does mere man become aware of weddings but bride knoweth bride at the glance of an eye and between them swiftly passes comfort and meaning in a language that man and widows wot not of the romance of a busy broker pitcher confidential clerk in the office of harvey maxwell broker allowed a look of mild interest and surprise to visit his usually expressionless countenance when his employer briskly entered at half past nine in company with his young lady stenographer with a snappy good morning pitcher maxwell dashed at his desk as though he were intending to leap over it and then plunged into the great heap of letters and telegrams waiting there for him the young lady had been maxwell s stenographer for a year she was beautiful in a way that was decidedly unstenographic she forewent the pomp of the alluring pompadour she wore no chains bracelets or lockets she had not the air of being about to accept an invitation to luncheon her dress was grey and plain but it fitted her figure with fidelity and discretion in her neat black turban hat was the gold green wing of a macaw on this morning she was softly and shyly radiant her eyes were dreamily bright her cheeks genuine peachblow her expression a happy one tinged with reminiscence pitcher still mildly curious noticed a difference in her ways this morning instead of going straight into the adjoining room where her desk was she lingered slightly irresolute in the outer office once she moved over by maxwell s desk near enough for him to be aware of her presence the machine sitting at that desk was no longer a man it was a busy new york broker moved by buzzing wheels and uncoiling springs well what is it anything asked maxwell sharply his opened mail lay like a bank of stage snow on his crowded desk his keen grey eye impersonal and brusque flashed upon her half impatiently nothing answered the stenographer moving away with a little smile mr pitcher she said to the confidential clerk did mr maxwell say anything yesterday about engaging another stenographer he did answered pitcher he told me to get another one i notified the agency yesterday afternoon to send over a few samples this morning it s o clock and not a single picture hat or piece of pineapple chewing gum has showed up yet i will do the work as usual then said the young lady until some one comes to fill the place and she went to her desk at once and hung the black turban hat with the gold green macaw wing in its accustomed place he who has been denied the spectacle of a busy manhattan broker during a rush of business is handicapped for the profession of anthropology the poet sings of the crowded hour of glorious life the broker s hour is not only crowded but the minutes and seconds are hanging to all the straps and packing both front and rear platforms and this day was harvey maxwell s busy day the ticker began to reel out jerkily its fitful coils of tape the desk telephone had a chronic attack of buzzing men began to throng into the office and call at him over the railing jovially sharply viciously excitedly messenger boys ran in and out with messages and telegrams the clerks in the office jumped about like sailors during a storm even pitcher s face relaxed into something resembling animation on the exchange there were hurricanes and landslides and snowstorms and glaciers and volcanoes and those elemental disturbances were reproduced in miniature in the broker s offices maxwell shoved his chair against the wall and transacted business after the manner of a toe dancer he jumped from ticker to phone from desk to door with the trained agility of a harlequin in the midst of this growing and important stress the broker became suddenly aware of a high rolled fringe of golden hair under a nodding canopy of velvet and ostrich tips an imitation sealskin sacque and a string of beads as large as hickory nuts ending near the floor with a silver heart

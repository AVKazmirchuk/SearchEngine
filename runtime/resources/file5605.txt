tom little bear appeared to be inveigled some in his bosom about that mrs conyers she was of the kind that pleases she had the good looks and more i ll tell you you take one of these cloak models in a big store they strike you as being on the impersonal system they are adapted for the eye what they run to is inches around and complexion and the art of fanning the delusion that the sealskin would look just as well on the lady with the warts and the pocket book now if one of them models was off duty and you took it and it would say charlie when you pressed it and sit up at the table why then you would have something similar to mrs conyers i could see how john tom could resist any inclination to hate that white squaw the lady and the kid stayed at the hotel in the morning they say they will start for home me and little bear left at eight o clock and sold indian remedy on the courthouse square till nine he leaves me and the professor to drive down to camp while he stays up town i am not enamored with that plan for it shows john tom is uneasy in his composures and that leads to firewater and sometimes to the green corn dance and costs not often does chief wish heap dough get busy with the firewater but whenever he does there is heap much doing in the lodges of the palefaces who wear blue and carry the club at half past nine professor binkly is rolled in his quilt snoring in blank verse and i am sitting by the fire listening to the frogs mr little bear slides into camp and sits down against a tree there is no symptoms of firewater jeff says he after a long time a little boy came west to hunt indians well then says i for i wasn t thinking as he was and he bagged one says john tom and twas not with a gun and he never had on a velveteen suit of clothes in his life and then i began to catch his smoke i know it says i and i ll bet you his pictures are on valentines and fool men are his game red and white you win on the red says john tom calm jeff for how many ponies do you think i could buy mrs conyers scandalous talk i replies tis not a paleface custom john tom laughs loud and bites into a cigar no he answers tis the savage equivalent for the dollars of the white man s marriage settlement oh i know there s an eternal wall between the races if i could do it jeff i d put a torch to every white college that a redman has ever set foot inside why don t you leave us alone he says to our own ghost dances and dog feasts and our dingy squaws to cook our grasshopper soup and darn our moccasins now you sure don t mean disrespect to the perennial blossom entitled education says i scandalized because i wear it in the bosom of my own intellectual shirt waist i ve had education says i and never took any harm from it you lasso us goes on little bear not noticing my prose insertions and teach us what is beautiful in literature and in life and how to appreciate what is fine in men and women what have you done to me says he you ve made me a cherokee moses you ve taught me to hate the wigwams and love the white man s ways i can look over into the promised land and see mrs conyers but my place is on the reservation little bear stands up in his chief s dress and laughs again but white man jeff he goes on the paleface provides a recourse tis a temporary one but it gives a respite and the name of it is whiskey and straight off he walks up the path to town again now says i in my mind may the manitou move him to do only bailable things this night for i perceive that john tom is about to avail himself of the white man s solace maybe it was as i sat smoking when i hear pit a pats on the path and here comes mrs conyers running her hair twisted up any way and a look on her face that says burglars and mice and the flour s all out rolled in one oh mr peters she calls out as they will oh oh i made a quick think and i spoke the gist of it out loud now says i we ve been brothers me and that indian but i ll make a good one of him in two minutes if no no she says wild and cracking her knuckles i haven t seen mr little bear tis my husband he s stolen my boy oh she says just when i had him back in my arms again that heartless villain every bitterness life knows she says he s made me drink my poor little lamb that ought to be warm in his bed carried of by that fiend how did all this happen i ask let s have the facts i was fixing his bed she explains and roy was playing on the hotel porch and he drives up to the steps i heard roy scream and ran out my husband had him in the buggy then i begged him for my child this is what he gave me she turns her face to the light there is a crimson streak running across her cheek and mouth he did that with his whip she says come back to the hotel says i and we ll see what can be done on the way she tells me some of the wherefores when he slashed her with the whip he told her he found out she was coming for the kid and he was on the same train mrs conyers had been living with her brother and they d watched the boy always as her husband had tried to steal him before i judge that man was worse than a street railway promoter it seems he had spent her money and slugged her and killed her canary bird and told it around that she had cold feet at the hotel we found a mass meeting of five infuriated citizens chewing tobacco and denouncing the outrage most of the town was asleep by ten o clock i talks the lady some quiet and tells her i will take the one o clock train for the next town forty miles east for it is likely that the esteemed mr conyers will drive there to take the cars i don t know i tells her but what he has legal rights but if i find him i can give him an illegal left in the eye and tie him up for a day or two anyhow on a disturbal of the peace proposition mrs conyers goes inside and cries with the landlord s wife who is fixing some catnip tea that will make everything all right for the poor dear the landlord comes out on the porch thumbing his one suspender and says to me ain t had so much excitements in town since bedford steegall s wife swallered a spring lizard i seen him through the winder hit her with the buggy whip and everything what s that suit of clothes cost you you got on pears like we d have some rain don t it say doc that indian of yorn s on a kind of a whizz to night ain t he he comes along just before you did and i told him about this here occurrence he gives a cur us kind of a hoot and trotted off i guess our constable ll have him in the lock up fore morning i thought i d sit on the porch and wait for the one o clock train i wasn t feeling saturated with mirth here was john tom on one of his sprees and this kidnapping business losing sleep for me but then i m always having trouble with other people s troubles every few minutes mrs conyers would come out on the porch and look down the road the way the buggy went like she expected to see that kid coming back on a white pony with a red apple in his hand now wasn t that like a woman and that brings up cats i saw a mouse go in this hole says mrs cat you can go prize up a plank over there if you like i ll watch this hole about a quarter to one o clock the lady comes out again restless crying easy as females do for their own amusement and she looks down that road again and listens now ma am says i there s no use watching cold wheel tracks by this time they re halfway to hush she says holding up her hand and i do hear something coming flip flap in the dark and then there is the awfulest war whoop ever heard outside of madison square garden at a buffalo bill matinee and up the steps and on to the porch jumps the disrespectable indian the lamp in the hall shines on him and i fail to recognize mr j t little bear alumnus of the class of what i see is a cherokee brave and the warpath is what he has been travelling firewater and other things have got him going his buckskin is hanging in strings and his feathers are mixed up like a frizzly hen s the dust of miles is on his moccasins and the light in his eye is the kind the aborigines wear but in his arms he brings that kid his eyes half closed with his little shoes dangling and one hand fast around the indian s collar pappoose says john tom and i notice that the flowers of the white man s syntax have left his tongue he is the original proposition in bear s claws and copper color me bring says he and he lays the kid in his mother s arms run fifteen mile says john tom ugh catch white man bring pappoose the little woman is in extremities of gladness she must wake up that stir up trouble youngster and hug him and make proclamation that he is his mamma s own precious treasure i was about to ask questions but i looked at mr little bear and my eye caught the sight of something in his belt now go to bed ma am says i and this gadabout youngster likewise for there s no more danger and the kidnapping business is not what it was earlier in the night i inveigled john tom down to camp quick and when he tumbled over asleep i got that thing out of his belt and disposed of it where the eye of education can t see it for even the football colleges disapprove of the art of scalp taking in their curriculums it is ten o clock next day when john tom wakes up and looks around i am glad to see the nineteenth century in his eyes again what was it jeff he asks heap firewater says i john tom frowns and thinks a little combined says he directly with the interesting little physiological shake up known as reversion to type i remember now have they gone yet on the train i answers ugh says john tom better so paleface bring big chief wish heap dough a little bromo seltzer and then he ll take up the redman s burden again helping the other fellow originally published in munsey s magazine december but can thim that helps others help thimselves mulvaney this is the story that william trotter told me on the beach at aguas frescas while i waited for the gig of the captain of the fruit steamer andador which was to take me abroad reluctantly i was leaving the land of always afternoon william was remaining and he favored me with a condensed oral autobiography as we sat on the sands in the shade cast by the bodega nacional as usual i became aware that the man from bombay had already written the story but as he had compressed it to an eight word sentence i have become an expansionist and have quoted his phrase above with apologies to him and best regards to terence ii don t you ever have a desire to go back to the land of derby hats and starched collars i asked him you seem to be a handy man and a man of action i continued and i am sure i could find you a comfortable job somewhere in the states ragged shiftless barefooted a confirmed eater of the lotos william trotter had pleased me much and i hated to see him gobbled up by the tropics i ve no doubt you could he said idly splitting the bark from a section of sugar cane i ve no doubt you could do much for me if every man could do as much for himself as he can for others every country in the world would be holding millenniums instead of centennials there seemed to be pabulum in w t s words and then another idea came to me i had a brother in chicopee falls who owned manufactories cotton or sugar or a a sheetings or something in the commercial line lie was vulgarly rich and therefore reverenced art the artistic temperament of the family was monopolized at my birth i knew that brother james would honor my slightest wish i would demand from him a position in cotton sugar or sheetings for william trotter something say at two hundred a month or thereabouts i confided my beliefs and made my large propositions to william he had pleased me much and he was ragged while we were talking there was a sound of firing guns four or five rattlingly as if by a squad the cheerful noise came from the direction of the cuartel which is a kind of makeshift barracks for the soldiers of the republic hear that said william trotter let me tell you about it a year ago i landed on this coast with one solitary dollar i have the same sum in my pocket to day i was second cook on a tramp fruiter and they marooned me here early one morning without benefit of clergy just because i poulticed the face of the first mate with cheese omelette at dinner the fellow had kicked because i d put horseradish in it instead of cheese when they threw me out of the yawl into three feet of surf i waded ashore and sat down under a palm tree by and by a fine looking white man with a red face and white clothes genteel as possible but somewhat under the influence came and sat down beside me i had noticed there was a kind of a village back of the beach and enough scenery to outfit a dozen moving picture shows but i thought of course it was a cannibal suburb and i was wondering whether i was to be served with carrots or mushrooms and as i say this dressed up man sits beside me and we become friends in the space of a minute or two for an hour we talked and he told me all about it it seems that he was a man of parts conscientiousness and plausibility besides being educated and a wreck to his appetites he told me all about it colleges had turned him out and distilleries had taken him in did i tell you his name it was clifford wainwright i didn t exactly catch the cause of his being cast away on that particular stretch of south america but i reckon it was his own business i asked him if he d ever been second cook on a tramp fruiter and he said no so that concluded my line of surmises but he talked like the encyclopedia from a berlin to trilo zyria and he carried a watch a silver arrangement with works and up to date within twenty four hours anyhow i m pleased to have met you says wainwright i m a devotee to the great joss booze but my ruminating facilities are unrepaired says he or words to that effect and i hate says he to see fools trying to run the world i never touch a drop says i and there are many kinds of fools and the world runs on its own apex according to science with no meddling from me i was referring says he to the president of this republic his country is in a desperate condition its treasury is empty it s on the verge of war with nicamala and if it wasn t for the hot weather the people would be starting revolutions in every town here is a nation goes on wainwright on the brink of destruction a man of intelligence could rescue it from its impending doom in one day by issuing the necessary edicts and orders president gomez knows nothing of statesmanship or policy do you know adam smith lemme see says i there was a one eared man named smith in fort worth texas but i think his first name was i am referring to the political economist says wainwright s mother smith then says i the one i speak of never was arrested so wainwright boils some more with indignation at the insensibility of people who are not corpulent to fill public positions and then he tells me he is going out to the president s summer palace which is four miles from aguas frescas to instruct him in the art of running steam heated republics come along with me trotter says he and i ll show you what brains can do anything in it i asks the satisfaction says he of redeeming a country of two hundred thousand population from ruin back to prosperity and peace great says i i ll go with you i d prefer to eat a live broiled lobster just now but give me liberty as second choice if i can t be in at the death wainwright and me permeates through the town and he halts at a rum dispensary have you any money he asks i have says i fishing out my silver dollar i always go about with adequate sums of money then we ll drink says wainwright not me says i not any demon ruin or any of its ramifications for mine it s one of my non weaknesses it s my failing says he what s your particular soft point industry says i promptly i m hard working diligent industrious and energetic my dear mr trotter says he surely i ve known you long enough to tell you you are a liar every man must have his own particular weakness and his own particular strength in other things now you will buy me a drink of rum and we will call on president gomez iii well sir trotter went on we walks the four miles out through a virgin conservatory of palms and ferns and other roof garden products to the president s summer white house it was blue and reminded you of what you see on the stage in the third act which they describe as same as the first on the programs there was more than fifty people waiting outside the iron fence that surrounded the house and grounds there was generals and agitators and epergnes in gold laced uniforms and citizens in diamonds and panama hats all waiting to get an audience with the royal five card draw and in a kind of a summer house in front of the mansion we could see a burnt sienna man eating breakfast out of gold dishes and taking his time i judged that the crowd outside had come out for their morning orders and requests and was afraid to intrude but c wainwright wasn t the gate was open and he walked inside and up to the president s table as confident as a man who knows the head waiter in a fifteen cent restaurant and i went with him because i had only seventy five cents and there was nothing else to do the gomez man rises from his chair and looks colored man as he was like he was about to call out for corporal of the guard post number one but wainwright says some phrases to him in a peculiarly lubricating manner and the first thing you know we was all three of us seated at the table with coffee and rolls and iguana cutlets coming as fast as about ninety peons could rustle em and then wainwright begins to talk but the president interrupts him you yankees says he polite assuredly take the cake for assurance i assure you or words to that effect he spoke english better than you or me you ve had a long walk says he but it s nicer in the cool morning to walk than to ride may i suggest some refreshments says he rum says wainwright gimme a cigar says i well sir the two talked an hour keeping the generals and equities all in their good uniforms waiting outside the fence and while i smoked silent i listened to clifford wainwright making a solid republic out of the wreck of one i didn t follow his arguments with any special collocation of international intelligibility but he had mr gomez s attention glued and riveted he takes out a pencil and marks the white linen tablecloth all over with figures and estimates and deductions he speaks more or less disrespectfully of import and export duties and custom house receipts and taxes and treaties and budgets and concessions and such truck that politics and government require and when he gets through the gomez man hops up and shakes his hand and says he s saved the country and the people you shall be rewarded says the president might i suggest another rum says wainwright cigar for me darker brand says i well sir the president sent me and wainwright back to the town in a victoria hitched to two flea bitten selling platers but the best the country afforded i found out afterward that wainwright was a regular beachcomber the smartest man on the whole coast but kept down by rum i liked him one day i inveigled him into a walk out a couple of miles from the village where there was an old grass hut on the bank of a little river while he was sitting on the grass talking beautiful of the wisdom of the world that he had learned in books i took hold of him easy and tied his hands and feet together with leather thongs that i had in my pocket lie still says i and meditate on the exigencies and irregularities of life till i get back i went to a shack in aguas frescas where a mighty wise girl named timotea carrizo lived with her mother the girl was just about as nice as you ever saw in the states she would have been called a brunette but she was better than a brunette i should say she was what you might term an ecru shade i knew her pretty well i told her about my friend wainwright she gave me a double handful of bark calisaya i think it was and some more herbs that i was to mix with it and told me what to do i was to make tea of it and give it to him and keep him from rum for a certain time and for two weeks i did it you know i liked wainwright both of us was broke but timotea sent us goat meat and plantains and tortillas every day and at last i got the curse of drink lifted from clifford wainwright he lost his taste for it and in the cool of the evening him and me would sit on the roof of timotea s mother s hut eating harmless truck like coffee and rice and stewed crabs and playing the accordion about that time president gomez found out that the advice of c wainwright was the stuff he had been looking for the country was pulling out of debt and the treasury bad enough boodle in it for him to amuse himself occasionally with the night latch the people were beginning to take their two hour siestas again every day which was the surest sign of prosperity so down from the regular capital he sends for clifford wainwright and makes him his private secretary at twenty thousand peru dollars a year yes sir so much wainwright was on the water wagon thanks to me and timotea and he was soon in clover with the government gang don t forget what done it calisaya bark with them other herbs mixed make a tea of it and give a cupful every two hours try it yourself it takes away the desire as i said a man can do a lot more for another party than he can for himself wainwright with his brains got a whole country out of trouble and on its feet but what could he do for himself and without any special brains but with some nerve and common sense i put him on his feet because i never had the weakness that he did nothing but a cigar for mine thanks and trotter paused i looked at his tattered clothes and at his deeply sunburnt hard thoughtful face didn t cartright ever offer to do anything for you i asked wainwright corrected trotter yes he offered me some pretty good jobs but i d have bad to leave aguas frescas so i didn t take any of em up say i didn t tell you much about that girl timotea we rather hit it off together she was as good as you find em anywhere spanish mostly with just a twist of lemon peel on top what if they did live in a grass hut and went bare armed a month ago went on trotter she went away i don t know where to but you d better come back to the states i insisted i can promise you positively that my brother will give you a position in cotton sugar or sheetings i am not certain which i think she went back with her mother said trotter to the village in the mountains that they come from tell me what would this job you speak of pay why said i hesitating over commerce i should say fifty or a hundred dollars a month maybe two hundred ain t it funny said trotter digging his toes in the sand what a chump a man is when it comes to paddling his own canoe i don t know of course i m not making a living here i m on the bum but well i wish you could have seen that timotea every man has his own weak spot the gig from the andador was coming ashore to take out the captain purser and myself the lone passenger i ll guarantee said i confidently that my brother will pay you seventy five dollars a month all right then said william trotter i ll but a soft voice called across the blazing sands a girl faintly lemon tinted stood in the calle real and called she was bare armed but what of that it s her said william trotter looking she s come back i m obliged but i can t take the job thanks just the same ain t it funny how we can t do nothing for ourselves but we can do wonders for the other fellow you was about to get me with your financial proposition but we ve all got our weak points timotea s mine and say trotter had turned to leave but he retraced the step or two that he had taken i like to have left you without saying good bye said he it kind of rattles you when they go away unexpected for a month and come back the same way shake hands so long say do you remember them gunshots we heard a while ago up at the cuartel well i knew what they was but i didn t mention it it was clifford wainwright being shot by a squad of soldiers against a stone wall for giving away secrets of state to that nicamala republic oh yes it was rum that did it he backslided and got his i guess we all have our weak points and can t do much toward helping ourselves mine s waiting for me i d have liked to have that job with your brother but we ve all got our weak points so long iv a big black carib carried me on his back through the surf to the ship s boat on the way the purser handed me a letter that he had brought for me at the last moment from the post office in aguas frescas it was from my brother he requested me to meet him at the st charles hotel in new orleans and accept a position with his house in either cotton sugar or sheetings and with five thousand dollars a year as my salary when i arrived at the crescent city i hurried away far away from the st charles to a dim chambre garnie in bienville street and there looking down from my attic window from time to time at the old yellow absinthe house across the street i wrote this story to buy my bread and butter can thim that helps others help thimselves the marionettes originally published in the black cat for april the short story publishing co the policeman was standing at the corner of twenty fourth street and a prodigiously dark alley near where the elevated railroad crosses the street the time was two o clock in the morning the outlook a stretch of cold drizzling unsociable blackness until the dawn a man wearing a long overcoat with his hat tilted down in front and carrying something in one hand walked softly but rapidly out of the black alley the policeman accosted him civilly but with the assured air that is linked with conscious authority the hour the alley s musty reputation the pedestrian s haste the burden he carried these easily combined into the suspicious circumstances that required illumination at the officer s hands the suspect halted readily and tilted back his hat exposing in the flicker of the electric lights an emotionless smooth countenance with a rather long nose and steady dark eyes thrusting his gloved hand into a side pocket of his overcoat he drew out a card and handed it to the policeman holding it to catch the uncertain light the officer read the name charles spencer james m d the street and number of the address were of a neighborhood so solid and respectable as to subdue even curiosity the policeman s downward glance at the article carried in the doctor s hand a handsome medicine case of black leather with small silver mountings further endorsed the guarantee of the card all right doctor said the officer stepping aside with an air of bulky affability orders are to be extra careful good many burglars and hold ups lately bad night to be out not so cold but clammy with a formal inclination of his head and a word or two corroborative of the officer s estimate of the weather doctor james continued his somewhat rapid progress three times that night had a patrolman accepted his professional card and the sight of his paragon of a medicine case as vouchers for his honesty of person and purpose had any one of those officers seen fit on the morrow to test the evidence of that card he would have found it borne out by the doctor s name on a handsome doorplate his presence calm and well dressed in his well equipped office provided it were not too early doctor james being a late riser and the testimony of the neighborhood to his good citizenship his devotion to his family and his success as a practitioner the two years he had lived among them therefore it would have much surprised any one of those zealous guardians of the peace could they have taken a peep into that immaculate medicine case upon opening it the first article to be seen would have been an elegant set of the latest conceived tools used by the box man as the ingenious safe burglar now denominates himself specially designed and constructed were the implements the short but powerful jimmy the collection of curiously fashioned keys the blued drills and punches of the finest temper capable of eating their way into chilled steel as a mouse eats into a cheese and the clamps that fasten like a leech to the polished door of a safe and pull out the combination knob as a dentist extracts a tooth in a little pouch in the inner side of the medicine case was a four ounce vial of nitroglycerine now half empty underneath the tools was a mass of crumpled banknotes and a few handfuls of gold coin the money altogether amounting to eight hundred and thirty dollars to a very limited circle of friends doctor james was known as the swell greek half of the mysterious term was a tribute to his cool and gentlemanlike manners the other half denoted in the argot of the brotherhood the leader the planner the one who by the power and prestige of his address and position secured the information upon which they based their plans and desperate enterprises of this elect circle the other members were skitsie morgan and gum decker expert box men and leopold pretzfelder a jeweller downtown who manipulated the sparklers and other ornaments collected by the working trio all good and loyal men as loose tongued as memnon and as fickle as the north star that night s work had not been considered by the firm to have yielded more than a moderate repayal for their pains an old style two story side bolt safe in the dingy office of a very wealthy old style dry goods firm on a saturday night should have excreted more than twenty five hundred dollars but that was all they found and they had divided it the three of them into equal shares upon the spot as was their custom ten or twelve thousand was what they expected but one of the proprietors had proved to be just a trifle too old style just after dark he had carried home in a shirt box most of the funds on hand doctor james proceeded up twenty fourth street which was to all appearance depopulated even the theatrical folk who affect this district as a place of residence were long since abed the drizzle had accumulated upon the street puddles of it among the stones received the fire of the arc lights and returned it shattered into a myriad liquid spangles a captious wind shower soaked and chilling coughed from the laryngeal flues between the houses as the practitioner s foot struck even with the corner of a tall brick residence of more pretension than its fellows the front door popped open and a bawling negress clattered down the steps to the pavement some medley of words came from her mouth addressed like as not to herself the recourse of her race when alone and beset by evil she looked to be one of that old vassal class of the south voluble familiar loyal irrepressible her person pictured it fat neat aproned kerchiefed this sudden apparition spewed from the silent house reached the bottom of the steps as doctor james came opposite her brain transferring its energies from sound to sight she ceased her clamor and fixed her pop eyes upon the case the doctor carried bress de lawd was the benison the sight drew from her is you a doctor suh yes i am a physician said doctor james pausing den fo god s sake come and see mister chandler suh he done had a fit or sump n he layin jist like he wuz dead miss amy sont me to git a doctor lawd knows whar old cindy d a skeared one up from if you suh hadn t come along ef old mars knowed one ten hundredth part of dese doin s dey d be shootin gwine on suh pistol shootin leb m feet marked off on de ground and ev ybody a duellin and dat po lamb miss amy lead the way said doctor james setting his foot upon the step if you want me as a doctor as an auditor i m not open to engagements the negress preceded him into the house and up a flight of thickly carpeted stairs twice they came to dimly lighted branching hallways at the second one the now panting conductress turned down a hall stopping at a door and opening it i done brought de doctor miss amy doctor james entered the room and bowed slightly to a young lady standing by the side of a bed he set his medicine case upon a chair removed his overcoat throwing it over the case and the back of the chair an advanced with quiet self possession to the bedside there lay a man sprawling as he had fallen a man dressed richly in the prevailing mode with only his shoe removed lying relaxed and as still as the dead there emanated from doctor james an aura of calm force and reserve strength that was as manna in the desert to the weak and desolate among his patrons always had women especially been attracted by something in his sick room manner it was not the indulgent suavity of the fashionable healer but a manner of poise of sureness of ability to overcome fate of deference and protection and devotion there was an exploring magnetism in his steadfast luminous brown eves a latent authority in the impassive even priestly tranquillity of his smooth countenance that outwardly fitted him for the part of confidant and consoler sometimes at his first professional visit women would tell him where they hid their diamonds at night from the burglars with the ease of much practice doctor james s unroving eyes estimated the order and quality of the room s furnishings the appointments were rich and costly the same glance had secured cognizance of the lady s appearance she was small and scarcely past twenty her face possessed the title to a winsome prettiness now obscured by you would say rather a fixed melancholy than the more violent imprint of a sudden sorrow upon her forehead above one eyebrow was a livid bruise suffered the physician s eye told him within the past six hours doctor james s fingers went to the man s wrist his almost vocal eyes questioned the lady i am mrs chandler she responded speaking with the plaintive southern slur and intonation my husband was taken suddenly ill about ten minutes before you came he has had attacks of heart trouble before some of them were very bad his clothed state and the late hour seemed to prompt her to further explanation he had been out late to a supper i believe doctor james now turned his attention to his patient in whichever of his professions he happened to be engaged he was wont to honor the case or the job with his whole interest the sick man appeared to be about thirty his countenance bore a look of boldness and dissipation but was not without a symmetry of feature and the fine lines drawn by a taste and indulgence in humor that gave the redeeming touch there was an odor of spilled wine about his clothes the physician laid back his outer garments and then with a penknife slit the shirt front from collar to waist the obstacles cleared he laid his ear to the heart and listened intently mitral regurgitation he said softly when he rose the words ended with the rising inflection of uncertainty again he listened long and this time he said mitral insufficiency with the accent of an assured diagnosis madam he began in the reassuring tones that had so often allayed anxiety there is a probability as he slowly turned his head to face the lady he saw her fall white and swooning into the arms of the old negress po lamb po lamb has dey done killed aunt cindy s own blessed child may de lawd stroy wid his wrath dem what stole her away what break dat angel heart what left lift her feet said doctor james assisting to support the drooping form where is her room she must be put to bed in here suh the woman nodded her kerchiefed head toward a door dat s miss amy s room they carried her in there and laid her on the bed her pulse was faint but regular she passed from the swoon without recovering consciousness into a profound slumber she is quite exhausted said the physician sleep is a good remedy when she wakes give her a toddy with an egg in it if she can take it how did she get that bruise upon her forehead she done got a lick there suh de po lamb fell no suh the old woman s racial mutability swept her into a sudden flare of indignation old cindy ain t gwineter lie for dat debble he done it suh may de lawd wither de hand what dar now cindy promise her sweet lamb she ain t gwine tell miss amy got hurt suh on de head doctor james stepped to a stand where a handsome lamp burned and turned the flame low stay here with your mistress he ordered and keep quiet so she will sleep if she wakes give her the toddy if she grows any weaker let me know there is something strange about it dar s mo strange t ings dan dat round here began the negress but the physician hushed her in a seldom employed peremptory concentrated voice with which he had often allayed hysteria itself he returned to the other room closing the door softly behind him the man on the bed had not moved but his eyes were open his lips seemed to form words doctor james bent his head to listen the money the money was what they were whispering can you understand what i say asked the doctor speaking low but distinctly the head nodded slightly i am a physician sent for by your wife you are mr chandler i am told you are quite ill you must not excite or distress yourself at all the patient s eyes seemed to beckon to him the doctor stooped to catch the same faint words the money the twenty thousand dollars where is this money in the bank the eyes expressed a negative tell her the whisper was growing fainter the twenty thousand dollars her money his eyes wandered about the room you have placed this money somewhere doctor james s voice was toiling like a siren s to conjure the secret from the man s failing intelligence is it in this room he thought he saw a fluttering assent in the dimming eyes the pulse under his fingers was as fine and small as a silk thread there arose in doctor james s brain and heart the instincts of his other profession promptly as he acted in everything he decided to learn the whereabouts of this money and at the calculated and certain cost of a human life drawing from his pocket a little pad of prescription blanks he scribbled upon one of them a formula suited according to the best practice to the needs of the sufferer going to the door of the inner room he softly called the old woman gave her the prescription and bade her take it to some drug store and fetch the medicine when she had gone muttering to herself the doctor stepped to the bedside of the lady she still slept soundly her pulse was a little stronger her forehead was cool save where the inflammation of the bruise extended and a slight moisture covered it unless disturbed she would yet sleep for hours he found the key in the door and locked it after him when he returned doctor james looked at his watch he could call half an hour his own since before that time the old woman could scarcely return from her mission then he sought and found water in a pitcher and a glass tumbler opening his medicine case he took out the vial containing the nitroglycerine the oil as his brethren of the brace and bit term it one drop of the faint yellow thickish liquid he let fall in the tumbler he took out his silver hypodermic syringe case and screwed the needle into its place carefully measuring each modicum of water in the graduated glass barrel of the syringe he diluted the one drop with nearly half a tumbler of water two hours earlier that night doctor james had with that syringe injected the undiluted liquid into a hole drilled in the lock of a safe and had destroyed with one dull explosion the machinery that controlled the movement of the bolts he now purposed with the same means to shiver the prime machinery of a human being to rend its heart and each shock was for the sake of the money to follow the same means but in a different guise whereas that was the giant in its rude primary dynamic strength this was the courtier whose no less deadly arms were concealed by velvet and lace for the liquid in the tumbler and in the syringe that the physician carefully filled was now a solution of glonoin the most powerful heart stimulant known to medical science two ounces had riven the solid door of the iron safe with one fiftieth part of a minim he was now about to still forever the intricate mechanism of a human life but not immediately it was not so intended first there would be a quick increase of vitality a powerful impetus given to every organ and faculty the heart would respond bravely to the fatal spur the blood in the veins return more rapidly to its source but as doctor james well knew over stimulation in this form of heart disease means death as sure as by a rifle shot when the clogged arteries should suffer congestion from the increased flow of blood pumped into them by the power of the burglar s oil they would rapidly become no thoroughfare and the fountain of life would cease to flow the physician bared the chest of the unconscious chandler easily and skilfully he injected subcutaneously the contents of the syringe into the muscles of the region over the heart true to his neat habits in both professions he next carefully dried his needle and re inserted the fine wire that threaded it when not in use in three minutes chandler opened his eyes and spoke in a voice faint but audible inquiring who attended upon him doctor james again explained his presence there where is my wife asked the patient she is asleep from exhaustion and worry said the doctor i would not awaken her unless it isn t necessary chandler spoke with spaces between his words caused by his short breath that some demon was driving too fast she wouldn t thank you to disturb her on my account doctor james drew a chair to the bedside conversation must not be squandered a few minutes ago he began in the grave candid tones of his other profession you were trying to tell me something regarding some money i do not seek your confidence but it is my duty to advise you that anxiety and worry will work against your recovery if you have any communication to make about this to relieve your mind about this twenty thousand dollars i think was the amount you mentioned you would better do so chandler could not turn his head but he rolled his eyes in the direction of the speaker did i say where this money is no answered the physician i only inferred from your scarcely intelligible words that you felt a solicitude concerning its safety if it is in this room doctor james paused did he only seem to perceive a flicker of understanding a gleam of suspicion upon the ironical features of his patient had he seemed too eager had he said too much chandler s next words restored his confidence where should it be he gasped but in the safe there with his eyes he indicated a corner of the room where now for the first time the doctor perceived a small iron safe half concealed by the trailing end of a window curtain rising he took the sick man s wrist his pulse was beating in great throbs with ominous intervals between lift your arm said doctor james you know i can t move doctor the physician stepped swiftly to the hall door opened it and listened all was still without further circumvention he went to the safe and examined it of a primitive make and simple design it afforded little more security than protection against light fingered servants to his skill it was a mere toy a thing of straw and paste board the money was as good as in his hands with his clamps he could draw the knob punch the tumblers and open the door in two minutes perhaps in another way he might open it in one kneeling upon the floor he laid his ear to the combination plate and slowly turned the knob as he had surmised it was locked at only a day com upon one number his keen ear caught the faint warning click as the tumbler was disturbed he used the clue the handle turned he swung the door wide open the interior of the safe was bare not even a scrap of paper rested within the hollow iron cube doctor james rose to his feet and walked back to the bed a thick dew had formed upon the dying man s brow but there was a mocking grim smile on his lips and in his eyes i never saw it before he said painfully medicine and burglary wedded do you make the combination pay dear doctor than that situation afforded there was never a more rigorous test of doctor james s greatness trapped by the diabolic humor of his victim into a position both ridiculous and unsafe he maintained his dignity as well as his presence of mind taking out his watch he waited for the man to die you were just a shade too anxious about that money but it never was in any danger from you dear doctor it s safe perfectly safe it s all in the hands of the bookmakers twenty thousand amy s money i played it at the races lost every cent of it i ve been a pretty bad boy burglar excuse me doctor but i ve been a square sport i don t think i ever met such an eighteen carat rascal as you are doctor excuse me burglar in all my rounds is it contrary to the ethics of your gang burglar to give a victim excuse me patient a drink of water doctor james brought him a drink he could scarcely swallow it the reaction from the powerful drug was coming in regular intensifying waves but his moribund fancy must have one more grating fling gambler drunkard spendthrift i ve been those but a doctor burglar the physician indulged himself to but one reply to the other s caustic taunts bending low to catch chandler s fast crystallizing gaze he pointed to the sleeping lady s door with a gesture so stern and significant that the prostrate man half lifted his head with his remaining strength to see he saw nothing but he caught the cold words of the doctor the last sounds hie was to hear i never yet struck a woman it were vain to attempt to con such men there is no curriculum that can reckon with them in its ken thev are offshoots from the types whereof men say he will do this or he will do that we only know that they exist and that we can observe them and tell one another of their bare performances as children watch and speak of the marionettes yet it were a droll study in egoism to consider these two one an assassin and a robber standing above his victim the other baser in his offences if a lesser law breaker lying abhorred in the house of the wife he had persecuted spoiled and smitten one a tiger the other a dog wolf to consider each of them sickening at the foulness of the other and each flourishing out of the mire of his manifest guilt his own immaculate standard of conduct if not of honor the one retort of doctor james must have struck home to the other s remaining shreds of shame and manhood for it proved the coup de grace a deep blush suffused his face an ignominous rosa mortis the respiration ceased and with scarcely a tremor chandler expired close following upon his last breath came the negress bringing the medicine with a hand gently pressing upon the closed eyelids doctor james told her of the end not grief but a hereditary rapprochement with death in the abstract moved her to a dismal watery snuffling accompanied by her usual jeremiad dar now it s in de lawd s hands he am de jedge ob de transgressor and de suppo t of dem in distress he gwine hab suppo t us now cindy done paid out de last quarter fer dis bottle of physic and it nebber come to no use do i understand asked doctor james that mrs chandler has no money money suh you know what make miss amy fall down and so weak stahvation sub nothin to eat in dis house but some crumbly crackers in three days dat angel sell her finger rings and watch mont s ago dis fine house suh wid de red cyarpets and shiny bureaus it s all hired and de man talkin scan lous about de rent dat debble scuse me lawd he done in yo hands fer jedgment now he made way wid everything the physician s silence encouraged her to continue the history that he gleaned from cindy s disordered monologue was an old one of illusion wilfulness disaster cruelty and pride standing out from the blurred panorama of her gabble were little clear pictures an ideal home in the far south a quickly repented marriage an unhappy season full of wrongs and abuse and of late an inheritance of money that promised deliverance its seizure and waste by the dog wolf during a two months absence and his return in the midst of a scandalous carouse unobtruded but visible between every line ran a pure white thread through the smudged warp of the story the simple all enduring sublime love of the old negress following her mistress unswervingly through everything to the end when at last she paused the physician spoke asking if the house contained whiskey or liquor of any sort there was the old woman informed him half a bottle of brandy left in the sideboard by the dog wolf prepare a toddy as i told you said doctor james wake your mistress have her drink it and tell her what has happened some ten minutes afterward mrs chandler entered supported by old cindy s arm she appeared to be a little stronger since her sleep and the stimulant she had taken doctor james had covered with a sheet the form upon the bed the lady turned her mournful eyes once with a half frightened look toward it and pressed closer to her loyal protector her eyes were dry and bright sorrow seemed to have done its utmost with her the fount of tears was dried feeling itself paralyzed doctor james was standing near the table his overcoat donned his hat and medicine case in his hand his face was calm and impassive practice had inured him to the sight of human suffering his lambent brown eyes alone expressed a discreet professional sympathy he spoke kindly and briefly stating that as the hour was late and assistance no doubt difficult to procure he would himself send the proper persons to attend to the necessary finalities one matter in conclusion said the doctor pointing to the safe with its still wide open door your husband mrs chandler toward the end felt that he could not live and directed me to open that safe giving me the number upon which the combination is set in case you may need to use it you will remember that the number is forty one turn several times to the right then to the left once stop at forty one he would not permit me to waken you though he knew the end was near in that safe he said he had placed a sum of money not large but enough to enable you to carry out his last request that was that you should return to your old home and in after days when time shall have made it easier forgive his many sins against you he pointed to the table where lay an orderly pile of banknotes surmounted by two stacks of gold coins the money is there as he described it eight hundred and thirty dollars i beg to leave my card with you in case i can be of any service later on so he had thought of her and kindly at the last so late and yet the lie fanned into life one last spark of tenderness where she had thought all was turned to ashes and dust she cried aloud rob rob she turned and upon the ready bosom of her true servitor diluted her grief in relieving tears it is well to think also that in the years to follow the murderer s falsehood shone like a little star above the grave of love comforting her and gaining the forgiveness that is good in itself whether asked for or no hushed and soothed upon the dark bosom like a child by a crooning babbling sympathy at last she raised her head but the doctor was gone the marquis and miss sally originally published in everybody

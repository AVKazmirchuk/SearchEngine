s dream one of the most puzzling phases of that strange waking sleep is that dreams which seem to cover months or even years may take place within a few seconds or minutes murray was waiting in his cell in the ward of the condemned an electric arc light in the ceiling of the corridor shone brightly upon his table on a sheet of white paper an ant crawled wildly here and there as murray blocked its way with an envelope the electrocution was set for eight o clock in the evening murray smiled at the antics of the wisest of insects there were seven other condemned men in the chamber since he had been there murray had seen three taken out to their fate one gone mad and fighting like a wolf caught in a trap one no less mad offering up a sanctimonious lip service to heaven the third a weakling collapsed and strapped to a board he wondered with what credit to himself his own heart foot and face would meet his punishment for this was his evening he thought it must be nearly eight o clock opposite his own in the two rows of cells was the cage of bonifacio the sicilian slayer of his betrothed and of two officers who came to arrest him with him murray had played checkers many a long hour each calling his move to his unseen opponent across the corridor bonifacio s great booming voice with its indestructible singing quality called out eh meestro murray how you feel all a right yes all right bonifacio said murray steadily as he allowed the ant to crawl upon the envelope and then dumped it gently on the stone floor dat s good a meestro murray men like us we must a die like a men my time come nex a week all a right remember meestro murray i beat a you dat las game of de check maybe we play again some a time i don a know maybe we have to call a de move damn a loud to play de check where dey goin send us bonifacio s hardened philosophy followed closely by his deafening musical peal of laughter warmed rather than chilled murray s numbed heart yet bonifacio had until next week to live the cell dwellers heard the familiar loud click of the steel bolts as the door at the end of the corridor was opened three men came to murray s cell and unlocked it two were prison guards the other was len no that was in the old days now the reverend leonard winston a friend and neighbor from their barefoot days i got them to let me take the prison chaplain s place he said as he gave murray s hand one short strong grip in his left hand he held a small bible with his forefinger marking a page murray smiled slightly and arranged two or three books and some penholders orderly on his small table he would have spoken but no appropriate words seemed to present themselves to his mind the prisoners had christened this cellhouse eighty feet long twenty eight feet wide limbo lane the regular guard of limbo lane an immense rough kindly man drew a pint bottle of whiskey from his pocket and offered it to murray saying it s the regular thing you know all has it who feel like they need a bracer no danger of it becoming a habit with em you see murray drank deep into the bottle that s the boy said the guard just a little nerve tonic and everything goes smooth as silk they stepped into the corridor and each one of the doomed seven knew limbo lane is a world on the outside of the world but it had learned when deprived of one or more of the five senses to make another sense supply the deficiency each one knew that it was nearly eight and that murray was to go to the chair at eight there is also in the many limbo lanes an aristocracy of crime the man who kills in the open who beats his enemy or pursuer down flushed by the primitive emotions and the ardor of combat holds in contempt the human rat the spider and the snake so of the seven condemned only three called their farewells to murray as he marched down the corridor between the two guards bonifacio marvin who had killed a guard while trying to escape from the prison and bassett the train robber who was driven to it because the express messenger wouldn t raise his hands when ordered to do so the remaining four smoldered silent in their cells no doubt feeling their social ostracism in limbo lane society more keenly than they did the memory of their less picturesque offences against the law murray wondered at his own calmness and nearly indifference in the execution room were about twenty men a congregation made up of prison officers newspaper reporters and lookers on who had succeeded here in the very middle of a sentence the hand of death interrupted the telling of o henry s last story he had planned to make this story different from his others the beginning of a new series in a style he had not previously attempted i want to show the public he said that i can write something new new for me i mean a story without slang a straightforward dramatic plot treated in a way that will come nearer my idea of real story writing before starting to write the present story he outlined briefly how he intended to develop it murray the criminal accused and convicted of the brutal murder of his sweetheart a murder prompted by jealous rage at first faces the death penalty calm and to all

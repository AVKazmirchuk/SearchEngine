some little trifle for a souvenir to remind em not to get caught again and then alfred e ricks grovels at bill s feet again and bids us adieu he says he will have a team at a farmhouse and drive to the station below and take the train for denver it salubrified the atmosphere when that lamentable boll worm took his departure he was a disgrace to every non industrial profession in the country with all his big schemes and fine offices he had wound up unable even to get an honest meal except by the kindness of a strange and maybe unscrupulous burglar i was glad to see him go though i felt a little sorry for him now that he was ruined forever what could such a man do without a big capital to work with why alfred e ricks as we left him was as helpless as turtle on its back he couldn t have worked a scheme to beat a little girl out of a penny slate pencil when me and bill bassett was left alone i did a little sleight of mind turn in my head with a trade secret at the end of it thinks i i ll show this mr burglar man the difference between business and labor he had hurt some of my professional self adulation by casting his persians upon commerce and trade i won t take any of your money as a gift mr bassett says i to him but if you ll pay my expenses as a travelling companion until we get out of the danger zone of the immoral deficit you have caused in this town s finances to night i ll be obliged bill bassett agreed to that and we hiked westward as soon as we could catch a safe train when we got to a town in arizona called los perros i suggested that we once more try our luck on terra cotta that was the home of montague silver my old instructor now retired from business i knew monty would stake me to web money if i could show him a fly buzzing round the locality bill bassett said all towns looked alike to him as he worked mainly in the dark so we got off the train in los perros a fine little town in the silver region i had an elegant little sure thing in the way of a commercial slungshot that i intended to hit bassett behind the ear with i wasn t going to take his money while he was asleep but i was going to leave him with a lottery ticket that would represent in experience to him i think that was the amount he had when we got off the train but the first time i hinted to him about an investment he turns on me and disencumbers himself of the following terms and expressions brother peters says he it ain t a bad idea to go into an enterprise of some kind as you suggest i think i will but if i do it will be such a cold proposition that nobody but robert e peary and charlie fairbanks will be able to sit on the board of directors i thought you might want to turn your money over says i i do says he frequently i can t sleep on one side all night i ll tell you brother peters says he i m going to start a poker room i don t seem to care for the humdrum in swindling such as peddling egg beaters and working off breakfast food on barnum and bailey for sawdust to strew in their circus rings but the gambling business says he from the profitable side of the table is a good compromise between swiping silver spoons and selling penwipers at a waldorf astoria charity bazar then says i mr bassett you don t care to talk over my little business proposition why says he do you know you can t get a pasteur institute to start up within fifty miles of where i live i bite so seldom so bassett rents a room over a saloon and looks around for some furniture and chromos the same night i went to monty silver s house and he let me have on my prospects then i went to the only store in los perros that sold playing cards and bought every deck in the house the next morning when the store opened i was there bringing all the cards back with me i said that my partner that was going to back me in the game had changed his mind and i wanted to sell the cards back again the storekeeper took em at half price yes i was seventy five dollars loser up to that time but while i had the cards that night i marked every one in every deck that was labor and then trade and commerce had their innings and the bread i had cast upon the waters began to come back in the form of cottage pudding with wine sauce of course i was among the first to buy chips at bill bassett s game he had bought the only cards there was to be had in town and i knew the back of every one of them better than i know the back of my head when the barber shows me my haircut in the two mirrors when the game closed i had the five thousand and a few odd dollars and all bill bassett had was the wanderlust and a black cat he had bought for a mascot bill shook hands with me when i left brother peters says he i have no business being in business i was preordained to labor when a no burglar tries to make a james out of his jimmy he perpetrates an improfundity you have a well oiled and efficacious system of luck at cards says he

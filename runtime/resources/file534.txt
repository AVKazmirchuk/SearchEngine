uncle or do you want to scrap wit mike o grady for de santa claus belt in dis district clearly that spot in the moral vineyard was preempted so caliph spraggins menaced no more the people in the bazaars of the east side to keep down his growing surplus he doubled his donations to organized charity presented the y m c a of his native town with a collection of butterflies and sent a check to the famine sufferers in china big enough to buy new emerald eyes and diamond filled teeth for all their gods but none of these charitable acts seemed to bring peace to the caliph s heart he tried to get a personal note into his benefactions by tipping bellboys and waiters and bills he got well snickered at and derided for that by the minions who accept with respect gratuities commensurate to the service performed he sought out an ambitious and talented but poor young woman and bought for her the star part in a new comedy he might have gotten rid of more of his cumbersome money in this philanthropy if he had not neglected to write letters to her but she lost the suit for lack of evidence while his capital still kept piling up and his optikos needleorum camelibus or rich man s

hornpipes keep this picture in mind and let the artist do his worst celia looked out of her window one day and gave her heart to the grocer s young man the receiver thereof was at that moment engaged in conceding immortality to his horse and calling down upon him the ultimate fate of the wicked so he did not notice the transfer a horse should stand still when you are lifting a crate of strictly new laid eggs out of the wagon young lady reader you would have liked that grocer s young man yourself but you wouldn t have given him your heart because you are saving it for a riding master or a shoe manufacturer with a torpid liver or something quiet but rich in gray tweeds at palm beach oh i know about it so i am glad the grocer s young man was for celia and not for you the grocer s young man was slim and straight and as confident and easy in his movements as the man in the back of the magazines who wears the new frictionless roller suspenders he wore a gray bicycle cap on the back of his head and his hair was straw colored and curly and his sunburned face looked like one that smiled a good deal when he was not preaching the doctrine of everlasting punishment to delivery wagon horses he slung imported a fancy groceries about as though they were only the stuff he delivered at boarding houses and when he picked up his whip your mind instantly recalled mr tacktt and his air with the buttonless foils tradesmen delivered their goods at a side gate at the rear of the house the grocer s wagon came about ten in the morning for three days celia watched the driver when he came finding something new each time to admire in the lofty and almost contemptuous way he had of tossing around the choicest gifts of pomona ceres and the canning factories then she consulted annette to

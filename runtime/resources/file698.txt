ask you a question it is not an im pertinent one i hope was miss hayden left any thing by my uncle s will besides the ring and the nothing said mr tolman i thank you very much sir said gillian and on he went to his cab he gave the driver the ad dress of his late uncle s home miss hayden was writing letters in the library she was small and slender and clothed in black but you would have noticed her eyes gillian drifted in with his air of regarding the world as inconsequent i ve just come from old tolman s he explained they ve been going over the papers down there they found a gillian searched his memory for a legal term they found an amendment or a post script or something to the will it seemed that the old boy loosened up a little on second thoughts and willed you a thousand dollars i was driving up this way and tolman asked me to bring you the money here it is you d better count it to see if it s right gillian laid the money beside her hand on the desk miss hayden turned white oh she said and again oh gillian half turned and looked out the window i suppose of course be said in a low voice that you know i love you i am sorry said miss hayden taking up her money there is no use asked gillian almost light heartedly i am sorry she said again may i write a note asked gillian with a smile i re seated himself at the big library table she sup plied him with paper and pen and then went back to her secretaire gillian made out his account of his expenditure of the thousand dollars i i these words paid by the black sheep robert gillian on account of the eternal happiness owed by heaven to the best and dearest woman on earth gillian slipped his writing into an envelope bowed and went his way his cab stopped again at the offices of tolman sharp i have expended the thousand dollars he said cheerily to tolman of the gold glasses and i have come to render account of it as i agreed there is quite a feeling of summer in the air do you not think so mr tolman he tossed a white envelope on the lawyer s table you will find there a memo randum sir of the modus operandi of the vanishing of the dollars without touching the envelope mr tolman went to a door and called his partner sharp together they explored the caverns of an immense safe forth they dragged as trophy of their search a big envelope sealed with wax this they forcibly invaded and wagged their venerable heads together over its con tents then tolman became spokesman mr gillian he said formally there was a codicil to your uncle s will it was intrusted to us privately with instructions that it be not opened until you had furnished us with a full account of your handling of the bequest in the will as you have fulfilled the conditions my partner and i have read the codicil i do not wish to encumber your understanding with its legal phraseology but i will acquaint you with the spirit of its contents in the event that your disposition of the demonstrates that you possess any of the qualifica tions that deserve reward much benefit will accrue to you mr sharp and i are named as the judges and i assure you that we will do our duty strictly according to justice with liberality we are not at all unfavorably disposed toward you mr gillian but let us return to the letter of the codicil if your disposal of the money in question has been prudent wise or unselflish it is in our power to hand you over bonds to the value of which have been placed in our hands for that purpose but if as our client the late mr gillian explicitly provides you have used this money as you have money in the past i quote the late mr gillian in reprehensible dissipation among disreputable associates the is to be paid to miriam hayden ward of the late mr gillian without delay now mr gillian mr sharp and i will examine your account in regard to the you submit it in writing i believe i hope you will repose confidence in our decision mr tolman reached for the envelope gillian was a little the quicker in taking it up he tore the account and its cover leisurely into strips and dropped them into his pocket it s all right he said smilingly there isn t a bit of need to bother you with this i don t suppose you d understand these itemized bets anyway i lost the thousand dollars on the races good day to you gentlemen tolman sharp shook their beads mournfully at each other when gillian left for they heard him whis tling gayly in the hallway as he waited for the elevator the defeat of the city robert walmsley s descent upon the city resulted in a kilkenny struggle he came out of the fight victor by a fortune and a reputation on the other band he was swallowed up by the city the city gave him what he demanded and then branded him with its brand it remodelled cut trimmed and stamped him to the pattern it approves it opened its social gates to him and shut him in on a close cropped formal lawn with the select herd of rumi nants in dress habits manners provincialism routine and narrowness he acquired that charming in solence that irritating completeness that sophisti cated crassness that overbalanced poise that makes the manhattan gentleman so delightfully small in his greatness one of the up state rural counties pointed with pride to the successful young metropolitan lawyer

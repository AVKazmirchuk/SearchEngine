i never heard of a mob in our city doing violence to a motorman because of an accident said the new yorker you are not liable to said the tall man they know the motorman s all right and that he wouldn t even run over a stray dog if he could help it and they know that not a man among em would tie the knot to hang even a thomas cat that had been tried and condemned and sentenced according to law then why do they become infuriated and make threats of lynching asked the new yorker to assure the motorman answered the tall man that he is safe if they really wanted to do him up they would go into the houses and drop bricks on him from the third story windows new yorkers are not cowards said the other man a little stiffly not one at a time agreed the tall man promptly you ve got a fine lot of single handed scrappers in your town i d rather fight three of you than one and i d go up against all the gas trust s victims in a bunch before i d pass two citizens on a dark corner with my watch chain showing when you get rounded up in a bunch you lose your nerve get you in crowds and you re easy ask the l road guards and george b cortelyou and the tintype booths at coney island divided you stand united you fall e pluribus nihil whenever one of your mobs surrounds a man and begins to holler lynch him he says to himself oh dear i suppose i must look pale to please the boys but i will forsooth let my life insurance premium lapse to morrow this is a sure tip for me to play methuselah straight across the board in the next handicap i can imagine the tortured feelings of a prisoner in the hands of new york policemen when an infuriated mob demands that he be turned over to them for lynching for god s sake officers cries the distracted wretch have ye hearts of stone that ye will not let them wrest me from ye sorry jimmy says one of the policemen but it won t do there s three of us me and darrel and the plain clothes man and there s only sivin thousand of the mob how d we explain it at the office if they took ye jist chase the infuriated aggregation around the corner darrel and we ll be movin along to the station some of our gatherings of excited citizens have not been so harmless said the new yorker with a faint note of civic pride i ll admit that said the tall man a cousin of mine who was on a visit here once had an arm broken and lost an ear in one of them that must have been during the cooper union riots remarked the new yorker not the cooper union explained the tall man but it was a union riot at the vanastor wedding you seem to be in favor of lynch law said the new yorker severely no sir i am not no intelligent man is but sir there are certain cases when people rise in their just majesty and take a righteous vengeance for crimes that the law is slow in punishing i am an advocate of law and order but i will say to you that less than six months ago i myself assisted at the lynching of one of that race that is creating a wide chasm between your section of country and mine sir it is a deplorable condition said the new yorker that exists in the south but i am from indiana sir said the tall man taking another chew and i don t think you will condemn my course when i tell you that the colored man in question had stolen in cash sir from my own brother the snow man editorial note before the fatal illness of william sydney porter known through his literary work as o henry this american master of short story writing had begun for hampton s magazine the story printed below illness crept upon him rapidly and he was compelled to give up writing about at the point where the girl enters the story when he realized that he could do no more it was his lifelong habit to write with a pencil never dictating to a stenographer o henry told in detail the remainder of the snow man to harris merton lyon whom he had often spoken of as one of the most effective short story writers of the present time mr porter had delineated all of the characters leaving only the rounding out of the plot in the final pages to mr lyon housed and windowpaned from it the greatest wonder to little children is the snow to men it is something like a crucible in which their world melts into a white star ten million miles away the man who can stand the test is a snow man and this is his reading by fahrenheit reaumur or moses s carven tablets of stone night had fluttered a sable pinion above the canyon of big lost river and i urged my horse toward the bay horse ranch because the snow was deepening the flakes were as large as an hour s circular tatting by miss wilkins s ablest spinster betokening a heavy snowfall and less entertainment and more adventure than the completion of the tatting could promise i knew ross curtis of the bay horse and that i would be welcome as a snow bound pilgrim both for hospitality s sake and because ross had few chances to confide in living creatures who did not neigh bellow bleat yelp or howl during his discourse the ranch house was just within the jaws of the canyon where its builder may have fatuously fancied that the timbered and rocky walls on both sides would have protected it from the wintry colorado winds but i feared the drift even now through the endless bottomless rift in the hills the speaking tube of the four winds came roaring the voice of the proprietor to the little room on the top floor at my hello a ranch hand came from an outer building and received my thankful horse in another minute ross and i sat by a stove in the dining room of the four room ranch house while the big simple welcome of the household lay at my disposal fanned by the whizzing norther the fine dry snow was sifted and bolted through the cracks and knotholes of the logs the cook room without a separating door appended in there i could see a short sturdy leisurely and weather beaten man moving with professional sureness about his red hot stove his face was stolid and unreadable something like that of a great thinker or of one who had no thoughts to conceal i thought his eye seemed unwarrantably superior to the elements and to the man but quickly attributed that to the characteristic self importance of a petty chef camp cook was the niche that i gave him in the hall of types and he fitted it as an apple fits a dumpling cold it was in spite of the glowing stove and ross and i sat and talked shuddering frequently half from nerves and half from the freezing draughts so he brought the bottle and the cook brought boiling water and we made prodigious hot toddies against the attacks of boreas we clinked glasses often they sounded like icicles dropping from the eaves or like the tinkle of a thousand prisms on a louis xiv chandelier that i once heard at a boarder s dance in the parlor of a ten a week boarding house in gramercy square sic transit silence in the terrible beauty of the snow and of the sphinx and of the stars but they who believe that all things from a without wine table d hote to the crucifixion may be interpreted through music might have found a nocturne or a symphony to express the isolation of that blotted out world the clink of glass and bottle the aeolian chorus of the wind in the house crannies its deeper trombone through the canyon below and the wagnerian crash of the cook s pots and pans united in a fit discordant melody i thought no less welcome an accompaniment was the sizzling of broiling ham and venison cutlet indorsed by the solvent fumes of true java bringing rich promises of comfort to our yearning souls the cook brought the smoking supper to the table he nodded to me democratically as he cast the heavy plates around as though he were pitching quoits or hurling the discus i looked at him with some appraisement and curiosity and much conciliation there was no prophet to tell us when that drifting evil outside might cease to fall and it is well when snow bound to stand somewhere within the radius of the cook s favorable consideration but i could read neither favor nor disapproval in the face and manner of our pot wrestler he was about five feet nine inches and two hundred pounds of commonplace bull necked pink faced callous calm he wore brown duck trousers too tight and too short and a blue flannel shirt with sleeves rolled above his elbows there was a sort of grim steady scowl on his features that looked to me as though he had fixed it there purposely as a protection against the weakness of an inherent amiability that he fancied were better concealed and then i let supper usurp his brief occupancy of my thoughts draw up george said ross let s all eat while the grub s hot you fellows go on and chew answered the cook i ate mine in the kitchen before sun down think it ll be a big snow george asked the ranchman george had turned to reenter the cook room he moved slowly around and looking at his face it seemed to me that he was turning over the wisdom and knowledge of centuries in his head it might was his delayed reply at the door of the kitchen he stopped and looked back at us both ross and i held our knives and forks poised and gave him our regard some men have the power of drawing the attention of others without speaking a word their attitude is more effective than a shout and again it mightn t said george and went back to his stove after we had eaten he came in and gathered the emptied dishes he stood for a moment while his spurious frown deepened it might stop any minute he said or it might keep up for days at the farther end of the cook room i saw george pour hot water into his dishpan light his pipe and put the tableware through its required lavation he then carefully unwrapped from a piece of old saddle blanket a paperback book and settled himself to read by his dim oil lamp and then the ranchman threw tobacco on the cleared table and set forth again the bottles and glasses and i saw that i stood in a deep channel through which the long dammed flood of his discourse would soon be booming but i was half content comparing my fate with that of the late thomas tucker who had to sing for his supper thus doubling the burdens of both himself and his host snow is a hell of a thing said ross by way of a foreword it ain t somehow it seems to me salubrious i can stand water and mud and two inches below zero and a hundred and ten in the shade and medium sized cyclones but this here fuzzy white stuff naturally gets me all locoed i reckon the reason it rattles you is because it changes the look of things so much it s like you had a wife and left her in the morning with the same old blue cotton wrapper on and rides in of a night and runs across her all outfitted in a white silk evening frock waving an ostrich feather fan and monkeying with a posy of lily flowers wouldn t it make you look for your pocket compass you d be liable to kiss her before you collected your presence of mind by and by the flood of ross s talk was drawn up into the clouds so it pleased me to fancy and there condensed into the finer snowflakes of thought and we sat silent about the stove as good friends and bitter enemies will do i thought of boss s preamble about the mysterious influence upon man exerted by that ermine lined monster that now covered our little world and knew he was right of all the curious knickknacks mysteries puzzles indian gifts rat traps and well disguised blessings that the gods chuck down to us from the olympian peaks the most disquieting and evil bringing is the snow by scientific analysis it is absolute beauty and purity so at the beginning we look doubtfully at chemistry it falls upon the world and lo we live in another it hides in a night the old scars and familiar places with which we have grown heart sick or enamored so as quietly as we can we hustle on our embroidered robes and hie us on prince camaralzaman s horse or in the reindeer sleigh into the white country where the seven colors converge this is when our fancy can overcome the bane of it but in certain spots of the earth comes the snow madness made known by people turned wild and distracted by the bewildering veil that has obscured the only world they know in the cities the white fairy who sets the brains of her dupes whirling by a wave of her wand is cast for the comedy role her diamond shoe buckles glitter like frost with a pirouette she invites the spotless carnival but in the waste places the snow is sardonic sponging out the world of the outliers it gives no foothold on another sphere in return it makes of the earth a firmament under foot it leaves us clawing and stumbling in space in an inimical fifth element whose evil outdoes its strangeness and beauty there nature low comedienne plays her tricks on man though she has put him forth as her highest product it appears that she has fashioned him with what seems almost incredible carelessness and indexterity one sided and without balance with his two halves unequally fashioned and joined must he ever jog his eccentric way the snow falls the darkness caps it and the ridiculous man biped strays in accurate circles until he succumbs in the ruins of his defective architecture in the throat of the thirsty the snow is vitriol in appearance as plausible as the breakfast food of the angels it is as hot in the mouth as ginger increasing the pangs of the water famished it is a derivative from water air and some cold uncanny fire from which the caloric has been extracted good has been said of it even the poets crazed by its spell and shivering in their attics under its touch have indited permanent melodies commemorative of its beauty still to the saddest overcoated optimist it is a plague a corroding plague that pharaoh successfully side stepped it beneficently covers the wheat fields swelling the crop and the flour trust gets us by the throat like a sudden quinsy it spreads the tail of its white kirtle over the red seams of the rugged north and the alaskan short story is born etiolated perfidy it shelters the mountain traveler burrowing from the icy air and melting to morrow drowns his brother in the valley below at its worst it is lock and key and crucible and the wand of circe when it corrals man in lonely ranches mountain cabins and forest huts the snow makes apes and tigers of the hardiest it turns the bosoms of weaker ones to glass their tongues to infants rattles their hearts to lawlessness and spleen it is not all from the isolation the snow is not merely a blockader it is a chemical test it is a good man who can show a reaction that is not chiefly composed of a drachm or two of potash and magnesia with traces of adam ananias nebuchadnezzar and the fretful porcupine this is no story you say well let it begin there was a knock at the door is the opening not full of context and reminiscence oh best buyers of best sellers we drew the latch and in stumbled etienne girod as he afterward named himself but just then he was no more than a worm struggling for life enveloped in a killing white chrysalis we dug down through snow overcoats mufflers and waterproofs and dragged forth a living thing with a van dyck beard and marvellous diamond rings we put it through the approved curriculum of snow rubbing hot milk and teaspoonful doses of whiskey working him up to a graduating class entitled to a diploma of three fingers of rye in half a glassful of hot water one of the ranch boys had already come from the quarters at ross s bugle like yell and kicked the stranger s staggering pony to some sheltered corral where beasts were entertained let a paragraphic biography of girod intervene etienne was an opera singer originally we gathered but adversity and the snow had made him non compos vocis the adversity consisted of the stranded san salvador opera company a period of hotel second story work and then a career as a professional palmist jumping from town to town for like other professional palmists every time he worked the heart line too strongly he immediately moved along the line of least resistance though etienne did not confide this to us we surmised that he had moved out into the dusk about twenty minutes ahead of a constable and had thus encountered the snow in his most sacred blue language he dilated upon the subject of snow for etienne was paris born and loved the snow with the same passion that an orchid does mee ser rhable commented etienne and took another three fingers complete cast iron pussy footed blank blank said ross and followed suit rotten said i the cook said nothing he stood in the door weighing our outburst and insistently from behind that frozen visage i got two messages via the m a m wireless one was that george considered our vituperation against the snow childish the other was that george did not love dagoes inasmuch as etienne was a frenchman i concluded i had the message wrong so i queried the other bright eyes you don t really mean dagoes do you and over the wireless came three deathly psychic taps yes then i reflected that to george all foreigners were probably dagoes i had once known another camp cook who had thought mons sig and millie trans mississippi for mlle were italian given names this cook used to marvel therefore at the paucity of neo roman precognomens and therefore why not i have said that snow is a test of men for one day two days etienne stood at the window fletcherizing his finger nails and shrieking and moaning at the monotony to me etienne was just about as unbearable as the snow and so seeking relief i went out on the second day to look at my horse slipped on a stone broke my collarbone and thereafter underwent not the snow test but the test of flat on the back a test that comes once too often for any man to stand however i bore up cheerfully i was now merely a spectator and from my couch in the big room i could lie and watch the human interplay with that detached impassive impersonal feeling which french writers tell us is so valuable to the litterateur and american writers to the faro dealer i shall go crazy in this abominable mee ser rhable place was etienne s constant prediction never knew mark twain to bore me before said ross over and over he sat by the other window hour after hour a box of pittsburg stogies of the length strength and odor of a pittsburg graft scandal deposited on one side of him and roughing it the jumping frog and life on the mississippi on the other for every chapter he lit a new stogy puffing furiously this in time gave him a recurrent premonition of cramps gastritis smoker s colic or whatever it is they have in pittsburg after a too deep indulgence in graft scandals to fend off the colic ross resorted time and again to old doctor still s amber colored u s a colic cure result after forty eight hours nerves positive fact i never knew mark twain to make me tired before positive fact ross slammed roughing it on the floor when you re snowbound this away you want tragedy i guess humor just seems to bring out all your cussedness you read a man s poor pitiful attempts to be funny and it makes you so nervous you want to tear the book up get out your bandana and have a good long cry at the other end of the room the frenchman took his finger nails out of his mouth long enough to exclaim humor humor at such a time as thees my god i shall go crazy in thees abominable supper announced george these meals were not the meals of rabelais who said the great god makes the planets and we make the platters neat by that time the ranch house meals were not affairs of gusto they were mental distraction not bodily provender what they were to be later shall never be forgotten by ross or me or etienne after supper the stogies and finger nails began again my shoulder ached wretchedly and with half closed eyes i tried to forget it by watching the deft movements of the stolid cook suddenly i saw him cock his ear like a dog then with a swift step he moved to the door threw it open and stood there the rest of us had heard nothing what is it george asked ross the cook reached out his hand into the darkness alongside the jamb with careful precision he prodded something then he made one careful step into the snow his back muscles bulged a little under the arms as he stooped and lightly lifted a burden another step inside the door which he shut methodically behind him and he dumped the burden at a safe distance from the fire he stood up and fixed us with a solemn eye none of us moved under that orphic suspense until a woman remarked george miss willie adams was her name vocation school teacher present avocation getting lost in the snow age yum yum the persian for twenty take to the woods if you would describe miss adams a willow for grace a hickory for fibre a birch for the clear whiteness of her skin for eyes the blue sky seen through treetops the silk in cocoons for her hair her voice the murmur of the evening june wind in the leaves her mouth the berries of the wintergreen fingers as light as ferns her toe as small as a deer track general impression upon the dazed beholder you could not see the forest for the trees psychology with a capital p and the foot of a lynx at this juncture stalks into the ranch house three men a cook a pretty young woman all snowbound count me out of it as i did not count anyway i never did with women count the cook out if you like but note the effect upon ross and etienne girod ross dumped mark twain in a trunk and locked the trunk also he discarded the pittsburg scandals also he shaved off a three days beard etienne being french began on the beard first he pomaded it from a little tube of grease hongroise in his vest pocket he combed it with a little aluminum comb from the same vest pocket he trimmed it with manicure scissors from the same vest pocket his light and gallic spirits underwent a sudden miraculous change he hummed a blithe san salvador opera company tune he grinned smirked bowed pirouetted twiddled twaddled twisted and tooralooed gayly the notorious troubadour could not have equalled etienne ross s method of advance was brusque domineering little woman he said you re welcome here and with what he thought subtle double meaning welcome to stay here as long as you like snow or no snow miss adams thanked him a little wildly some of the wintergreen berries creeping into the birch bark she looked around hurriedly as if seeking escape but there was none save the kitchen and the room allotted her she made an excuse and disappeared into her own room later i feigning sleep heard the following mees adams i was almost to perislh die of monotony w en your fair and beautiful face appear in thees mee ser rhable house i opened my starboard eye the beard was being curled furiously around a finger the svengali eye was rolling the chair was being hunched closer to the school teacher s i am french you see temperamental nervous i cannot endure thees dull hours in thees ranch house but a woman comes ah the shoulders gave nine rahs and a tiger what a difference all is light and gay ever ting smile w en you smile you have eart beauty grace my eart comes back to me w en i feel your eart so he laid his hand upon his vest pocket from this vantage point he suddenly snatched at the school teacher s own hand ah mees adams if i could only tell you how i ad dinner remarked george he was standing just behind the frenchman s ear his eyes looked straight into the school teacher s eyes after thirty seconds of survey his lips moved deep in the flinty frozen maelstrom of his face dinner he concluded will be ready in two minutes miss adams jumped to her feet relieved i must get ready for dinner she said brightly and went into her room ross came in fifteen minutes late after the dishes had been cleaned away i waited until a propitious time when the room was temporarily ours alone and told him what had happened he became so excited that he lit a stogy without thinking yeller hided unwashed palm readin skunk he said under his breath i ll shoot him full o holes if he don t watch out talkin that way to my wife i gave a jump that set my collarbone back another week your wife i gasped well i mean to make her that he announced the air in the ranch house the rest of that day was tense with pent up emotions oh best buyers of best sellers ross watched miss adams as a hawk does a hen he watched etienne as a hawk does a scarecrow etienne watched miss adams as a weasel does a henhouse he paid no attention to ross the condition of miss adams in the role of sought after was feverish lately escaped from the agony and long torture of the white cold where for hours nature had kept the little school teacher s vision locked in and turned upon herself nobody knows through what profound feminine introspections she had gone now suddenly cast among men instead of finding relief and security she beheld herself plunged anew into other discomforts even in her own room she could hear the loud voices of her imposed suitors i ll blow you full o holes shouted ross witnesses shrieked etienne waving his hand at the cook and me she could not have known the previous harassed condition of the men fretting under indoor conditions all she knew was that where she had expected the frank freemasonry of the west she found the subtle tangle of two men s minds bent upon exacting whatever romance there might be in her situation she tried to dodge ross and the frenchman by spells of nursing me they also came over to help nurse this combination aroused such a natural state of invalid cussedness on my part that they were all forced to retire once she did manage to whisper i am so worried here i don t know what to do to which i replied gently hitching up my shoulder that i was a hunch savant and that the eighth house under this sign the moon being in virgo showed that everything would turn out all right but twenty minutes later i saw etienne reading her palm and felt that perhaps i might have to recast her horoscope and try for a dark man coming with a bundle toward sunset etienne left the house for a few moments and ross who had been sitting taciturn and morose having unlocked mark twain made another dash it was typical ross talk he stood in front of her and looked down majestically at that cool and perfect spot where miss adams forehead met the neat part in her fragrant hair first however he cast a desperate glance at me i was in a profound slumber little woman he began it s certainly tough for a man like me to see you bothered this way you gulp you have been alone in this world too long you need a protector i might say that at a time like this you need a protector the worst kind a protector who would take a three ring delight in smashing the saffron colored kisser off of any yeller skinned skunk that made himself obnoxious to you hem hem i am a lonely man miss adams i have so far had to carry on my life without the gulp sweet radiance gulp of a woman around the house i feel especially doggoned lonely at a time like this when i am pretty near locoed from havin to stall indoors and hence it was with delight i welcomed your first appearance in this here shack since then i have been packed jam full of more different kinds of feelings ornery mean dizzy and superb than has fallen my way in years miss adams made a useless movement toward escape the ross chin stuck firm i don t want to annoy you miss adams but by heck if it comes to that you ll have to be annoyed and i ll have to have my say this palm ticklin slob of a frenchman ought to be kicked off the place and if you ll say the word off he goes but i don t want to do the wrong thing you ve got to show a preference i m gettin around to the point miss miss willie in my own brick fashion i ve stood about all i can stand these last two days and somethin s got to happen the suspense hereabouts is enough to hang a sheepherder miss willie he lassooed her hand by main force just say the word you need somebody to take your part all your life long will you mar supper remarked george tersely from the kitchen door miss adams hurried away ross turned angrily you i have been revolving it in my head said george he brought the coffee pot forward heavily then bravely the big platter of pork and beans then somberly the potatoes then profoundly the biscuits i have been revolving it in my mind there ain t no use waitin any longer for swengalley might as well eat now from my excellent vantage point on the couch i watched the progress of that meal ross muddled glowering disappointed etienne eternally blandishing attentive ogling miss adams nervous picking at her food hesitant about answering questions almost hysterical now and then the solid flitting shadow of the cook passing behind their backs like a dreadnaught in a fog i used to own a clock which gurgled in its throat three minutes before it struck the hour i know therefore the slow freight of anticipation for i have awakened at three in the morning heard the clock gurgle and waited those three minutes for the three strokes i knew were to come alors in ross s ranch house that night the slow freight of climax whistled in the distance etienne began it after supper miss aclams had suddenly displayed a lively interest in the kitchen layout and i could see her in there chatting brightly at george not with him the while he ducked his head and rattled his pans my fren said etienne exhaling a large cloud from his cigarette and patting ross lightly on the shoulder with a bediamonded hand which hung limp from a yard or more of bony arm i see i mus be frank with you firs because we are rivals second because you take these matters so serious i i am frenchman i love the women he threw back his curls bared his yellow teeth and blew an unsavory kiss toward the kitchen it is i suppose a trait of my nation all frenchmen love the women pretty women now look here i am he spread out his arms cold outside i detes the col l l snow i abominate the mees ser rhable snow two men this pointing to me an this pointing to ross i am distracted for two whole days i stan at the window an tear my air i am nervous upset pr r ro foun ly distress inside my ead an suddenly be old a woman a nice pretty charming innocen young woman i naturally rejoice i become myself again gay light earted appy i address myself to mademoiselle it passes the time that m sieu is wot the women are for pass the time entertainment like the music like the wine they appeal to the mood the caprice the temperamen to play with thees woman follow her through her humor pursue her ah that is the mos delightful way to sen the hours about their business ross banged the table shut up you miserable yeller pup he roared i object to your pursuin anything or anybody in my house now you listen to me you he picked up the box of stogies and used it on the table as an emphasizer the noise of it awoke the attention of the girl in the kitchen unheeded she crept into the room i don t know anything about your french ways of lovemakin an i don t care in my section of the country it s the best man wins and i m the best man here and don t you forget it this girl s goin to be mine there ain t g oing to be any playing or philandering or palm reading about it i ve made up my mind i ll have this girl and that settles it my word is the law in this neck o the woods she s mine and as soon as she says she s mine you pull out the box made one final tremendous punctuation point etienne s bravado was unruffled ah that is no way to win a woman he smiled easily i make prophecy you will never win er that way no not thees woman she mus be played along an then keessed this charming delicious little creature one kees an then you ave her again he displayed his unpleasant teeth i make you a bet i will kees her as a cheerful chronicler of deeds done well it joys me to relate that the hand which fell upon etienne s amorous lips was not his own there was one sudden sound as of a mule kicking a lath fence and then through the swinging doors of oblivion for etienne i had seen this blow delivered it was an aloof unstudied almost absent minded affair i had thought the cook was rehearsing the proper method of turning a flapjack silently lost in thought he stood there scratching his head then he began rolling down his sleeves you d better get your things on miss and we ll get out of here he decided wrap up warm i heard her heave a little sigh of relief as she went to get her cloak sweater and hat ross jumped to his feet and said george what are you goin to do george who had been headed in my direction slowly swivelled around and faced his employer bein a camp cook i ain t over burdened with hosses george enlightened us therefore i am going to try to borrow this feller s here for the first time in four days my soul gave a genuine cheer if it s for lochinvar purposes go as far as you like i said grandly the cook studied me a moment as if trying to find an insult in my words no he replied it s for mine and the young lady s purposes and we ll go only three miles to hicksville now let me tell you somethin ross suddenly i was confronted with the cook s chunky back and i heard a low curt carrying voice shoot through the room at my host george had wheeled just as ross started to speak you re nutty that s what s the matter with you you can t stand the snow you re getting nervouser and nuttier every day that and this dago he jerked a thumb at the half dead frenchman in the corner has got you to the point where i thought i better horn in i got to revolving it around in my mind and i seen if somethin wasn t done and done soon there d be murder around here and maybe his head gave an imperceptible list toward the girl s room worse he stopped but he held up a stubby finger to keep any one else from speaking then he plowed slowly through the drift of his ideas about this here woman i know you ross and i know what you reely think about women if she hadn t happened in here durin this here snow you d never have given two thoughts to the whole woman question likewise when the storm clears and you and the boys go hustlin out this here whole business ll clear out of your head and you won t think of a skirt again until kingdom come just because o this snow here don t forget you re living in the selfsame world you was in four days ago and you re the same man too now what s the use o getting all snarled up over four days of stickin in the house that there s what i been revolvin in my mind and this here s the decision i ve come to he plodded to the door and shouted to one of the ranch hands to saddle my horse ross lit a stogy and stood thoughtful in the middle of the room then he began i ve a durn good notion george to knock your confounded head off and throw you into that snowbank if you re wrong mister that ain t a durned good notion you ve got it s durned bad look here he pointed steadily out of doors until we were both forced to follow his finger you re in here for more n a week yet after allowing this fact to sink in he barked out at ross can you cook then at me can you cook then he looked at the wreck of etienne and sniffed there was an embarrassing silence as ross and i thought solemnly of a foodless week if you just use hoss sense concluded george and don t go for to hurt my feelin s all i want to do is to take this young gal down to hicksville and then i ll head back here and cook fer you the horse and miss adams arrived simultaneously both of them very serious and quiet the horse because he knew what he had before him in that weather the girl because of what she had left behind then all at once i awoke to a realization of what the cook was doing my god man i cried aren t you afraid to go out in that snow behind my back i heard ross mutter not him george lifted the girl daintily up behind the saddle drew on his gloves put his foot in the stirrup and turned to inspect me leisurely as i passed slowly in his review i saw in my mind s eye the algebraic equation of snow the equals sign and the answer in the man before me snow is my last name said george he swung into the saddle and they started cautiously out into the darkening swirl of fresh new currency just issuing from the snowdrop mint the girl to keep her place clung happily to the sturdy figure of the camp cook i brought three things away from ross curtis s ranch house yes four one was the appreciation of snow which i have so humbly tried here to render was a collarbone of which i am extra careful was a memory of what it is to eat very extremely bad food for a week and was the cause of a little note delivered at the end of the week and hand painted in blue pencil on a sheet of meat paper i cannot come back there to that there job mrs snow say no george i been revolvin it in my mind considerin circumstances she s right whirligigs the world and the door a favourite dodge to get your story read by the public is to assert that it is true and then add that truth is stranger than fiction i do not know if the yarn i am anxious for you to read is true but the spanish purser of the fruit steamer el carrero swore to me by the shrine of santa guadalupe that he had the facts from the u s vice consul at la paz a person who could not possibly have been cognizant of half of them as for the adage quoted above i take pleasure in punc turing it by affirming that i read in a purely fictional story the other day the line be it so said the police man nothing so strange has yet cropped out in truth when h ferguson hedges millionaire promoter investor and man about new york turned his thoughts upon matters convivial and word of it went down the line bouncers took a precautionary turn at the indian clubs waiters put ironstone china on his favourite tables cab drivers crowded close to the curbstone in front of all night caf s and careful cashiers in his regular haunts charged up a few bottles to his account by way of preface and introduction as a money power a one millionaire is of small account in a city where the man who cuts your slice of beef behind the free lunch counter rides to work in his own automobile but hedges spent his money as lavishly loudly and showily as though he were only a clerk squandering a week s wages and after all the bartender takes no interest in your reserve fund he would rather look you up on his cash register than in bradstreet on the evening that the material allegation of facts begins hedges was bidding dull care begone in the com pany of five or six good fellows acquaintances and friends who had gathered in his wake among them were two younger men ralph merriam a broker and wade his friend two deep sea cabmen were chartered at columbus circle they hove to long enough to revile the statue of the great navigator unpatriotically rebuking him for having voyaged in search of land instead of liquids midnight overtook the party marooned in the rear of a cheap caf far uptown hedges was arrogant overriding and quarrelsome he was burly and tough iron gray but vigorous good for the rest of the night there was a dispute about nothing that matters and the five fingered words were passed the words that represent the glove cast into the lists merriam played the r le of the verbal hotspur hedges rose quickly seized his chair swung it once and smashed wildly dowp at merriam s head merriam dodged drew a small revolver and shot hedges in the chest the leading roysterer stumbled fell in a wry heap and lay still wade a commuter had formed that habit of prompt ness he juggled merriam out a side door walked him to the corner ran him a block and caught a hansom they rode five minutes and then got out on a dark corner and dismissed the cab across the street the lights of a small saloon betrayed its hectic hospitality go in the back room of that saloon said wade and wait i ll go find out what s doing and let you know you may take two drinks while i am gone no more at ten minutes to one o clock wade returned brace up old chap he said the ambulance got there just as i did the doctor says he s dead you may have one more drink you let me run this thing for you you ve got to skip i don t believe a chair is legally a deadly weapon you ve got to make tracks that s all there is to it merriam complained of the cold querulously and asked for another drink did you notice what big veins he had on the back of his hands he said i never could stand i never could take one more said wade and then come on i ll see you through wade kept his promise so well that at eleven o clock the next morning merriam with a new suit case full of new clothes and hair brushes stepped quietly on board a little ton fruit steamer at an east river pier the vessel had brought the season s first cargo of limes from port limon and was homeward bound merriam had his bank balance of in his pocket in large bills and brief instructions to pile up as much water as he could between himself and new york there was no time for anything more from port limon merriam worked down the coast by schooner and sloop to colon thence across the isthmus to panama where he caught a tramp bound for callao and such intermediate ports as might tempt the discursive skipper from his course it was at la paz that merriam decided to land la paz the beautiful a little harbourless town smothered in a living green ribbon that banded the foot of a cloud piercing mountain here the little steamer stopped to tread water while the captain s dory took him ashore that he might feel the pulse of the cocoanut market merriam went too with his suit case and remained kalb the vice consul a gr co armenian citizen of the united states born in hessen darmstadt and edu cated in cincinnati ward primaries considered all ameri cans his brothers and bankers he attached himself to merriam s elbow introduced him to every one in la paz who wore shoes borrowed ten dollars and went back to his hammock there was a little wooden hotel in the edge of a banana grove facing the sea that catered to the tastes of the few foreigners that had dropped out of the world into the t ri qte peruvian town at kalb s introductory shake hands with he had obediently exchanged manual salutations with a german doctor one french and two italian merchants and three or four americans who were spoken of as gold men rubber men mahogany men anything but men of living tissue after dinner merriam sat in a corner of the broad front galeria with bibb a vermonter interested in hydraulic mining and smoked and drank scotch smoke the moonlit sea spreading infinitely before him seemed to separate him beyond all apprehension from his old life the horrid tragedy in which he had played such a disas trous part now began for the first time since he stole on board the fruiter a wretched fugitive to lose its sharper outlines distance lent assuagement to his view bibb had opened the flood gates of a stream of long dammed discourse overjoyed to have captured an audience that had not suffered under a hundred repetitions of his views and theories one year more said bibb and i ll go back to god s country oh i know it s pretty here and you get dolce far niente banded to you in chunks but this country wasn t made for a white man to live in you ve got to have to plug through snow now and then and see a game of baseball and wear a stiff collar and have a policeman cuss you still la paz is a good sort of a pipe dreamy old hole and mrs conant is here when any of us feels particularly like jumping into the sea we rush around to her house and propose it s nicer to be rejected by mrs conant than it is to be drowned and they say drowning is a delightful sensation many like her here asked merriam not anywhere said bibb with a comfortable sigh she s the only white woman in la paz the rest range from a dappled dun to the colour of a b flat piano key she s been here a year comes from well you know how a woman can talk ask em to say string and they ll say crow s foot or cat s cradle some times you d think she was from oshkosh and again from jacksonville florida and the next day from cape cod mystery ventured merriam m well she looks it but her talk s translucent enough but that s a woman i suppose if the sphinx were to begin talking she d merely say goodness me more visitors coming for dinner and nothing to eat but the sand which is here but you won t think about that when you meet her merriam you ll propose to her too to make a hard story soft merriam did meet her and propose to her he found her to be a woman in black with hair the colour of a bronze turkey s wings and mysterious remembering eyes that well that looked as if she might have been a trained nurse looking on when eve was created her words and manner though were translucent as bibb had said she spoke vaguely of friends in california and some of the lower parishes in louisiana the tropical climate and indolent life suited her she had thought of buying an orange grove later on la paz all in all charmed her merriam s courtship of the sphinx lasted three months although be did not know that he was courting her he was using her as an antidote for remorse until he found too late that he had acquired the habit during that time he had received no news from home wade did not know where he was and he was not sure of wade s exact address and was afraid to write he thought he had better let matters rest as they were for a while one afternoon he and mrs conant hired two ponies and rode out along the mountain trail as far as the little cold river that came tumbling down the foothills there they stopped for a drink and merriam spoke his piece he proposed as bibb had prophesied mrs conant gave him one glance of brilliant tenderness and then her face took on such a strange haggard look that merriam was shaken out of his intoxication and back to his senses i beg your pardon florence he said releasing her hand but i ll have to hedge on part of what i said i can t ask you to marry me of course i killed a man in new york a man who was my friend shot him down in quite a cowardly manner i understand of course the drinking didn t excuse it well i couldn t resist having my say and i ll always mean it i m here as a fugitive from justice and i suppose that ends our acquaintance mrs conant plucked little leaves assiduously from the low hanging branch of a lime tree i suppose so she said in low and oddly uneven tones but that depends upon you i ll be as honest as you were i poisoned my husband i am a self made widow a man cannot love a murderess so i suppose that ends our acquaintance she looked up at him slowly his face turned a little pale and he stared at her blankly like a deaf and dumb man who was wondering what it was all about she took a swift step toward him with stiffened arms and eyes blazing don t look at me like that she cried as though she were in acute pain curse me or turn your back on me but don t look that way am i a woman to be beaten if i could show you here on my arms and on my back are scars and it has been more than a year scars that he made in his brutal rages a holy nun would have risen and struck the fiend down yes i killed him the foul and horrible words that he hurled at me that last day are repeated in my ears every night when i sleep and then came his blows and the end of my endurance i got the poison that afternoon it was his custom to drink every night in the library before going to bed a hot punch made of rum and wine only from my fair hands would he receive it because he knew the fumes of spirits always sickened me that night when the maid brought it to me i sent her downstairs on an errand before taking him his drink i went to my little private cabinet and poured into it more than a tea spoonful of tincture of aconite enough to kill three men so i had learned i had drawn that i had in bank and with that and a few things in a satchel i left the house without any one seeing me as i passed the library i heard him stagger up and fall heavily on a couch i took a night train for new orleans and from there i sailed to the bermudas i finally cast anchor in la paz and now what have you to say can you open your mouth merriam came back to life florence he said earnestly i want you i don t care what you ve done if the world ralph she interrupted almost with a scream be my world her eyes melted she relaxed magnificentlv and swayed toward merriam so suddenly that he had to jump to catch her dear me in such scenes how the talk runs into artificial prose but it can t be helped it s the subconscious smell of the footlights smoke that s in all of us stir the depths of your cook s soul sufficiently and she will discourse in bulwer lyttonese merriam and mrs conant were very happy he announced their engagement at the hotel orilla del mar eight foreigners and four native astors pounded his back and shouted insincere congratulations at him pedrito the castilian mannered barkeep was goaded to extra duty until his agility would have turned a boston cherry phosphate clerk a pale lilac with envy they were both very happy according to the strange mathematics of the god of mutual affinity the shadows that clouded their pasts when united became only half as dense instead of darker they shut the world out and bolted the doors each was the other s world mrs conant lived again the remembering look left her eyes merriam was with her every moment that was possible on a little plateau under a grove of palms and calabash trees they were going to build a fairy bungalow they were to be married in two months many hours of the day they had their heads together over the house plans their joint capital would set up a business in fruit or woods that would yield a comfortable support good night my world would say mrs conant every evening when merriam left her for his hotel they were very happy their love had circumstantially that element of melancholy in it that it seems to require to attain its supremest elevation and it seemed that their mutual great misfortune or sin was a bond that nothing could sever one day a steamer hove in the offing bare legged and bare shouldered la paz scampered down to the beach for the arrival of a steamer was their loop the loop circus emancipation day and four o clock tea when the steamer was near enough wise ones pro claimed that she was the pajaro bound up coast from callao to panama the paiaro put on brakes a mile off shore soon a boat came bobbing shoreward merriam strolled down on the beach to look on in the shallow water the carib sailors sprang out and dragged the boat with a mighty rush to the firm shingle out climbed the purser the captain and two passengers ploughing their way through the deep sand toward the hotel merriam glanced toward them with the mild interest due to strangers there was something familiar to him in the walk of one of the pas sengers he looked again and his blood seemed to turn to strawberry ice cream in his veins burly arrogant debonair as ever h ferguson hedges the man he had killed was coming toward him ten feet away when hedges saw merriam his face flushed a dark red then he shouted in his old bluff way hello merriam glad to see you didn t expect to find you out here quinby this is my old friend merriam of new york merriam mr quinby merriam gave hedges and then quinby an ice cold hand br r r r said hedges but you ve got a frapp d flipper man you re not well you re as yellow as a chinaman malarial here steer us to a bar if there is such a thing and let s take a prophylactic merriam still half comatose led them toward the hotel orilla del mar quinby and i explained hedges puffing through the slippery sand are looking out along the coast for some investments we ve just come up from concepci n and valparaiso and lima the captain of this sub sidized ferry boat told us there was some good picking around here in silver mines so we got off now where is that caf merriam oh in this portable soda water pavilion leaving quinby at

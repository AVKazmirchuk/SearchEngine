father yes said mary i am still reviewing books for the same publication after breakfast she helped wash the dishes and then all three sat in straigh back chairs in the bare floored parlor it is my custom said the old man on the sabbath day to read aloud from the great work entitled the apology for authorized and set forms of liturgy by the ecclesiastical philosopher and revered theologian jeremy taylor i know it said mary blissfully folding her hands for two hours the numbers of the great jeremy rolled forth like the notes of an oratorio played on the violoncello mary sat gloating in the new sensation of racking physical discomfort that the wooden chair brought her perhaps there is no happiness in life so perfect as the martyr s jeremy s minor chords soothed her like the music of a tom tom why oh why she said to herself does some one not write words to it at eleven they went to church in crocusville the back of the pine bench on which she sat had a penitential forward tilt that would have brought st simeon down in jealousy from his pillar the preacher singled her out and thundered upon her vicarious head the damnation of the world at each side of her an adamant parent held her rigidly to the bar of judgment an ant crawled upon her neck but she dared not move she lowered her eyes before the congregation a hundred eyed cerberus that watched the gates through which her sins were fast thrusting her her soul was filled with a delirious almost a fanatic joy for she was out of the clutch of the tyrant freedom dogma and creed pinioned her with beneficent cruelty as steel braces bind the feet of a crippled child she was hedged adjured shackled shored up strait jacketed silenced ordered when they came out the minister stopped to greet them mary could only hang her head and answer yes sir and no sir to his questions when she saw that the other women carried their hymn books at their waists with their left hands she blushed and moved hers there too from her right she took the three o clock train back to the city at nine she sat at the round table for dinner in the cafe andre nearly the same crowd was there where have you been to day asked mrs pothunter i phoned to you at twelve i have been away in bohemia answered mary with a mystic smile there mary has given it away she has spoiled my climax for i was to have told you that bohemia is nothing more than the little country in which you do not live if you try to obtain citizenship in it at once the court and retinue pack the royal archives and treasure and move away beyond the hills it is a hillside that you turn your head to peer at from the windows of the through express at exactly half past eleven kappelman deceived by a new softness and slowness of riposte and parry in mary adrian tried to kiss her instantly she slapped his face with such strength and cold fury that he shrank down sobered with the flaming red print of a hand across his leering features and all sounds ceased as when the shadows of great wings come upon a flock of chattering sparrows one had broken the paramount law of sham bohemia the law of laisser faire the shock came not from the blow delivered but from the blow received with the effect of a schoolmaster entering the play room of his pupils was that blow administered women pulled down their sleeves and laid prim hands against their ruffled side locks men looked at their watches there was nothing of the effect of a brawl about it it was purely the still panic produced by the sound of the ax of the fly cop conscience hammering at the gambling house doors of the heart with their punctilious putting on of cloaks with their exaggerated pretense of not having seen or heard with their stammering exchange of unaccustomed formalities with their false show of a light hearted exit i must take leave of my bohemian party mary has robbed me of my climax and she may go but i am not defeated somewhere there exists a great vault miles broad and miles long more capacious than the champagne caves of france in that vault are stored the anticlimaxes that should have been tagged to all the stories that have been told in the world i shall cheat that vault of one deposit minnie brown with her aunt came from crocusville down to the city to see the sights and because she had escorted me to fishless trout streams and exhibited to me open plumbed waterfalls and broken my camera while i julyed in her village i must escort her to the hives containing the synthetic clover honey of town especially did the custom made bohemia charm her the spaghetti wound its tendrils about her heart the free red wine drowned her belief in the existence of commercialism in the world she was dared and enchanted by the rugose wit that can be churned out of california claret but one evening i got her away from the smell of halibut and linoleum long enough to read to her the manuscript of this story which then ended before her entrance into it i read it to her because i knew that all the printing presses in the world were running to try to please her and some others and i asked her about it i didn t quite catch the trains said she how long was mary in crocusville ten hours and five minutes i replied well then the story may do said minnie but if she had stayed there a week kappelman would have got his kiss the ferry of unfulfilment at the

have a drink anyhow i wouldn t mind having a glass of lager beer acknowledged the other they went to a caf e frequented by men with smooth faces and shifty eyes and sat at their drinks i m glad i come across you mister said haylocks how d you like to play a game or two of seven up i ve got the keerds he fished them out of noah s valise a rare inimitable deck greasy with bacon suppers and grimy with the soil of cornfields bunco harry laughed loud and briefly not for me sport he said firmly i don t go against that make up of yours for a cent but i still say you ve overdone it the reubs haven t dressed like that since i doubt if you could work brooklyn for a key winding watch with that layout oh you needn t think i ain t got the money boasted haylocks he drew forth a tightly rolled mass of bills as large as a teacup and laid it on the table got that for my share of grandmother s farm he announced there s in that roll thought i d come to the city and look around for a likely business to go into bunco harry took up the roll of money and looked at it with almost respect in his smiling eyes i ve seen worse he said critically but you ll never do it in them clothes you want to get light tan shoes and a black suit and a straw hat with a colored band and talk a good deal about pittsburg and freight differentials and drink sherry for breakfast in order to work off phony stuff like that what s his line asked two or three shifty eyed men of bunco harry after haylocks had gathered up his impugned money and departed the queer i guess said harry or else he s one of jerome s men or some guy with a new graft he s too much hayseed maybe that his i wonder now oh no it couldn t have been real money haylocks wandered on thirst probably assailed him again for he dived into a dark groggery on a side street and bought beer at first sight of him their eyes brightened but when his insistent and exaggerated rusticity became apparent their expressions changed to wary suspicion haylocks swung his valise across the bar keep that a while for me mister he said chewing at the end of a virulent claybank cigar i ll be back after i knock around a spell and keep your eye on it for there s inside of it though maybe you wouldn t think so to look at me somewhere outside a phonograph struck up a band piece and haylocks was off for it his coat tail buttons flopping in the middle of his back divvy mike said the men hanging upon the bar winking openly at one another honest now said the bartender kicking the valise to one side you don t think i d fall to that do you anybody can see he ain t no jay one of mcadoo s come on squad i guess he s a shine if he made himself up there ain t no parts of the country now where they dress like that since they run rural free delivery to providence rhode island if he s got nine fifty in that valise it s a ninety eight cent waterbury that s stopped at ten minutes to ten when haylocks had exhausted the resources of mr edison to amuse he returned for his valise and then down broadway he gallivanted culling the sights with his eager blue eyes but still and evermore broadway rejected him with curt glances and sardonic smiles he was the oldest of the gags that the city must endure he was so flagrantly impossible so ultra rustic so exaggerated beyond the most freakish products of the barnyard the hayfield and the vaudeville stage that he excited only weariness and suspicion and the wisp of hay in his hair was so genuine so fresh and redolent of the meadows so clamorously rural that even a shellgame man would have put up his peas and folded his table at the sight of it haylocks seated himself upon a flight of stone steps and once more exhumed his roll of yellow backs from the valise the outer one a twenty he shucked off and beckoned to a newsboy son said he run somewhere and get this changed for me i m mighty nigh out of chicken feed i guess you ll get a nickel if you ll hurry up a hurt look appeared through the dirt on the newsy s face aw watchert ink g wan and get yer funny bill changed yerself dey ain t no farm clothes yer got on g wan wit yer stage money on a corner lounged a keen eyed steerer for a gambling house he was haylocks and his expression suddenly grew cold and virtuous mister said the rural one i ve heard of places in this here town where a fellow could have a good game of old sledge or peg a card at keno i got in this valise and i come down from old ulster to see the sights know where a fellow could get action on about or i m goin to have some sport and then maybe i ll buy out a business of some kind the steerer looked pained and investigated a white speck on his left forefinger nail cheese it old man he murmured reproachfully the central office must be bughouse to send you out looking like such a gillie you couldn t get within two blocks of a sidewalk crap game in them tony pastor props the recent mr scotty from death valley has got you beat a crosstown block in the way of elizabethan scenery

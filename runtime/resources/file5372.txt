nice things and swell people and look what a chance i ve got why one of our glove girls married a pittsburg steel maker or blacksmith or something the other day worth a million dollars i ll catch a swell myself some time i ain t bragging on my looks or anything but i ll take my chances where there s big prizes offered what show would a girl have in a laundry why that s where i met dan said lou triumphantly he came in for his sunday shirt and collars and saw me at the first board ironing we all try to get to work at the first board ella maginnis was sick that day and i had her place he said he noticed any arms first how round and white they was i had my sleeves rolled up some nice fellows come into laundries you can tell em by their bringing their clothes in suit cases and turning in the door sharp and sudden how can you wear a waist like that lou said nancy gazing down at the offending article with sweet scorn in her heavy lidded eyes it shows fierce taste this waist cried lou with wide eyed indignation why i paid for this waist it s worth twenty five a woman left it to be laundered and never called for it the boss sold it to me it s got yards and yards of hand embroidery on it better talk about that ugly plain thing you ve got on this ugly plain thing said nancy calmly was copied from one that mrs van alstyne fisher was wearing the girls say her bill in the store last year was i made mine myself it cost me ten feet away you couldn t tell it from hers oh well said lou good naturedly if you want to starve and put on airs go ahead but i ll take my job and good wages and after hours give me something as fancy and attractive to wear as i am able to buy but just then dan came a serious young man with a ready made necktie who had escaped the city s brand of frivolity an electrician earning dollars per week who looked upon lou with the sad eyes of romeo and thought her embroidered waist a web in which any fly should delight to be caught my friend mr owens shake hands with miss danforth said lou i m mighty glad to know you miss danforth said dan with outstretched hand i ve heard lou speak of you so often thanks said nancy touching his fingers with the tips of her cool ones i ve heard her mention you a few times lou giggled did you get that handshake from mrs van alstyne fisher nance she asked if i did you can feel safe in copying it said nancy oh i couldn t use it at all it s too stylish for me it s intended to set off diamond rings that high shake is wait till i get a few and then i ll try it learn it first said nancy wisely and you ll be more likely to get the rings now to settle this argument said dan with his ready cheerful smile let me make a proposition as i can t take both of you up to tiffany s and do the right thing what do you say to a little vaudeville i ve got the rickets how about looking at stage diamonds since we can t shake hands with the real sparklers the faithful squire tools his place close to the curb lou next a little peacocky in her bright and pretty clothes nancy on the inside slender and soberly clothed as the sparrow but with the true van alstyne fisher walk thus they set out for their evening s moderate diversion i do not suppose that many look upon a great department store as an educational institution but the one in which nancy worked was something like that to her she was surrounded by beautiful things that breathed of taste and refinement if you live in an atmosphere of luxury luxury is yours whether your money pays for it or another s the people she served were mostly women whose dress manners and position in the social world were quoted as criterions from them nancy began to take toll the best from each according to her view from one she would copy and practice a gesture from another an eloquent lifting of an eyebrow from others a manner of walking of carrying a purse of smiling of greeting a friend of addressing inferiors in station from her best beloved model mrs van alstyne fisher she made requisition for that excellent thing a soft low voice as clear as silver and as perfect in articulation as the notes of a thrush suffused in the aura of this high social refinement and good breeding it was impossible for her to escape a deeper effect of it as good habits are said to be better than good principles so perhaps good manners are better than good habits the teachings of your parents may not keep alive your new england conscience but if you sit on a straigh back chair and repeat the words prisms and pilgrims forty times the devil will flee from you and when nancy spoke in the van alstyne fisher tones she felt the thrill of noblesse oblige to her very bones there was another source of learning in the great departmental school whenever you see three or four shop girls gather in a bunch and jingle their wire bracelets as an accompaniment to apparently frivolous conversation do not think that they are there for the purpose of criticizing the way ethel does her back hair the meeting may lack the dignity of the deliberative bodies of man but it has all the importance of the occasion on which eve and her first daughter first put their heads together to make adam understand his proper place in the household it is woman s conference for common defense and exchange of strategical theories of attack and repulse upon and against the world which is a stage and man its audience who persists in throwing bouquets thereupon woman the most helpless of the young of any animal with the fawn s grace but without its fleetness with the bird s beauty but without its power of flight with the honey bee s burden of sweetness but without its oh let s drop that simile some of us may have been stung during this council of war they pass weapons one to another and exchange stratagems that each has devised and formulated out of the tactics of life i says to im says sadie ain t you the fresh thing who do you suppose i am to be addressing such a remark to me and what do you think he says back to me the heads brown black flaxen red and yellow bob together the answer is given and the parry to the thrust is decided upon to be used by each thereafter in passages at arms with the common enemy man thus nancy learned the art of defense and to women successful defense means victory the curriculum of a department store is a wide one perhaps no other college could have fitted her as well for her life s ambition the drawing of a matrimonial prize her station in the store was a favored one the music room was near enough for her to hear and become familiar with the works of the best composers at least to acquire the familiarity that passed for appreciation in the social world in which she was vaguely trying to set a tentative and aspiring foot she absorbed the educating influence of art wares of costly and dainty fabrics of adornments that are almost culture to women the other girls soon became aware of nancy s ambition here comes your millionaire nancy they would call to her whenever any man who looked the role approached her counter it got to be a habit of men who were hanging about while their women folk were shopping to stroll over to the handkerchief counter and dawdle over the cambric squares nancy s imitation high bred air and genuine dainty beauty was what attracted many men thus came to display their graces before her some of them may have been millionaires others were certainly no more than their sedulous apes nancy learned to discriminate there was a window at the end of the handkerchief counter and she could see the rows of vehicles waiting for the shoppers in the street below she looked and perceived that automobiles differ as well as do their owners once a fascinating gentleman bought four dozen handkerchiefs and wooed her across the counter with a king cophetua air when he had gone one of the girls said what s wrong nance that you didn t warm up to that fellow he looks the swell article all right to me him said nancy with her coolest sweetest most impersonal van alstyne fisher smile not for mine i saw him drive up outside a h p machine and an irish chauffeur and you saw what kind of handkerchiefs he bought silk and he s got dactylis on him give me the real thing or nothing if you please two of the most refined women in the store a forelady and a cashier had a few swell gentlemen friends with whom they now and then dined once they included nancy in an invitation the dinner took place in a spectacular cafe whose tables are engaged for new year s eve a year in advance there were two gentlemen friends one without any hair on his head high living ungrew it and we can prove it the other a young man whose worth and sophistication he impressed upon you in two convincing ways he swore that all the wine was corked and he wore diamond cuff buttons this young man perceived irresistible excellencies in nancy his taste ran to shop girls and here was one that added the voice and manners of his high social world to the franker charms of her own caste so on the following day he appeared in the store and made her a serious proposal of marriage over a box of hem stitched grass bleached irish linens nancy declined a brown pompadour ten feet away had been using her eyes and ears when the rejected suitor had gone she heaped carboys of upbraidings and horror upon nancy s head what a terrible little fool you are that fellow s a millionaire he s a nephew of old van skittles himself and he was talking on the level too have you gone crazy nance have i said nancy i didn t take him did i he isn t a millionaire so hard that you could notice it anyhow his family only allows him a year to spend the bald headed fellow was guying him about it the other night at supper the brown pompadour came nearer and narrowed her eyes say what do you want she inquired in a voice hoarse for lack of chewing gum ain t that enough for you do you want to be a mormon and marry rockefeller and gladstone dowie and the king of spain and the whole bunch ain t a year good enough for you nancy flushed a little under the level gaze of the black shallow eyes it wasn t altogether the money carrie she explained his friend caught him in a rank lie the other night at dinner it was about some girl he said he hadn t been to the theater with well i can t stand a liar put everything together i don t like him and that settles it when i sell out it s not going to be on any bargain day i ve got to have something that sits up in a chair like a man anyhow yes i m looking out for a catch but it s got to be able to do something more than make a noise like a toy bank the physiopathic ward for yours said the brown pompadour walking away these high ideas if not ideals nancy continued to cultivate on per week she bivouacked on the trail of the great unknown catch eating her dry bread and tightening her belt day by day on her face was the faint soldierly sweet grim smile of the preordained man hunter the store was her forest and many times she raised her rifle at game that seemed broad antlered and big but always some deep unerring instinct perhaps of the huntress perhaps of the woman made her hold her fire and take up the trail again lou flourished in the laundry out of her per week she paid for her room and board the rest went mainly for clothes her opportunities for bettering her taste and manners were few compared with nancy s in the steaming laundry there was nothing but work work and her thoughts of the evening pleasures to come many costly and showy fabrics passed under her iron and it may be that her growing fondness for dress was thus transmitted to her through the conducting metal when the day s work was over dan awaited her outside her faithful shadow in whatever light she stood sometimes he cast an honest and troubled glance at lou s clothes that increased in conspicuity rather than in style but this was no disloyalty he deprecated the attention they called to her in the streets and lou was no less faithful to her chum there was a law that nancy should go with them on whatsoever outings they might take dan bore the extra burden heartily and in good cheer it might be said that lou furnished the color nancy the tone and dan the weight of the distraction seeking trio the escort in his neat but obviously ready made suit his ready made tie and unfailing genial ready made wit never startled or clashed he was of that good kind that you are likely to forget while they are present but remember distinctly after they are gone to nancy s superior taste the flavor of these ready made pleasures was sometimes a little bitter but she was young and youth is a gourmand when it cannot be a gourmet dan is always wanting me to marry him right away lou told her once but why should i i m independent i can do as i please with the money i earn and he never would agree for me to keep on working afterward and say nance what do you want to stick to that old store for and half starve and half dress yourself i could get you a place in the laundry right now if you d come it seems to me that you could afford to be a little less stuck up if you could make a good deal more money i don t think i m stuck up lou said nancy but i d rather live on half rations and stay where i am i suppose i ve got the habit it s the chance that i want i don t expect to be always behind a counter i m learning something new every day i m right up against refined and rich people all the time even if i do only wait on them and i m not missing any pointers that i see passing around caught your millionaire yet asked lou with her teasing laugh i haven t selected one yet answered nancy i ve been looking them over goodness the idea of picking over em don t you ever let one get by you nance even if he s a few dollars shy but of course you re joking millionaires don t think about working girls like us it might be better for them if they did said nancy with cool wisdom some of us could teach them how to take care of their money if one was to speak to me laughed lou i know i d have a duck fit that s because you don t know any the only difference between swells and other people is you have to watch em closer don t you think that red silk lining is just a little bit too bright for that coat lou lou looked at the plain dull olive jacket of her friend well no i don t but it may seem so beside that faded looking thing you ve got on this jacket said nancy complacently has exactly the cut and fit of one that mrs van alstyne fisher was wearing the other day the material cost me i suppose hers cost about more oh well said lou lightly it don t strike me as millionaire bait shouldn t wonder if i catch one before you do anyway truly it would have taken a philosopher to decide upon the values of the theories held by the two friends lou lacking that certain pride and fastidiousness that keeps stores and desks filled with girls working for the barest living thumped away gaily with her iron in the noisy and stifling laundry her wages supported her even beyond the point of comfort so that her dress profited until sometimes she cast a sidelong glance of impatience at the neat but inelegant apparel of dan dan the constant the immutable the undeviating as for nancy her case was one of tens of thousands silk and jewels and laces and ornaments and the perfume and music of the fine world of good breeding and taste these were made for woman they are her equitable portion let her keep near them if they are a part of life to her and if she will she is no traitor to herself as esau was for she keeps he birthright and the pottage she earns is often very scant in this atmosphere nancy belonged and she throve in it and ate her frugal meals and schemed over her cheap dresses with a determined and contented mind she already knew woman and she was studying man the animal both as to his habits and eligibility some day she would bring down the game that she wanted but she promised herself it would be what seemed to her the biggest and the best and nothing smaller thus she kept her lamp trimmed and burning to receive the bridegroom when he should come but another lesson she learned perhaps unconsciously her standard of values began to shift and change sometimes the dollar mark grew blurred in her mind s eye and shaped itself into letters that spelled such words as truth and honor and now and then just kindness let us make a likeness of one who hunts the moose or elk in some mighty wood he sees a little dell mossy and embowered where a rill trickles babbling to him of rest and comfort at these times the spear of nimrod himself grows blunt so nancy wondered sometimes if persian lamb was always quoted at its market value by the hearts that it covered one thursday evening nancy left the store and turned across sixth avenue westward to the laundry she was expected to go with lou and dan to a musical comedy dan was just coming out of the laundry when she arrived there was a queer strained look on his face i thought i would drop around to see if they had heard from her he said heard from who asked nancy isn t lou there i thought you knew said dan she hasn t been here or at the house where she lived since monday she moved all her things from there she told one of the girls in the laundry she might be going to europe hasn t anybody seen her anywhere asked nancy dan looked at her with his jaws set grimly and a steely gleam in his steady gray eyes they told me in the laundry he said harshly that they saw her pass yesterday in an automobile with one of the millionaires i suppose that you and lou were forever busying your brains about for the first time nancy quailed before a man she laid her hand that trembled slightly on dan s sleeve you ve no right to say such a thing to me dan as if i had anything to do with it i didn t mean it that way said dan softening he fumbled in his vest pocket i ve got the tickets for the show to night he said with a gallant show of lightness if you nancy admired pluck whenever she saw it i ll go with you dan she said three months went by before nancy saw lou again at twilight one evening the shop girl was hurrying home along the border of a little quiet park she heard her name called and wheeled about in time to catch lou rushing into her arms after the first embrace they drew their heads back as serpents do ready to attack or to charm with a thousand questions trembling on their swift tongues and then nancy noticed that prosperity had descended upon lou manifesting itself in costly furs flashing gems and creations of the tailors art you little fool cried lou loudly and affectionately i see you are still working in that store and as shabby as ever and how about that big catch you were going to make nothing doing yet i suppose and then lou looked and saw that something better than prosperity lead descended upon nancy something that shone brighter than gems in her eyes and redder than a rose in her cheeks and that danced like electricity anxious to be loosed from the tip of her tongue yes i m still in the store said nancy but i m going to leave it next week i ve made my catch the biggest catch in the world you won t mind now lou will you i m going to be married to dan to dan he s my dan now why lou around the corner of the park strolled one of those new crop smooth faced young policemen that are making the force more endurable at least to the eye he saw a woman with an expensive fur coat and diamond ringed hands crouching down against the iron fence of the park sobbing turbulently while a slender plainly dressed working girl leaned close trying to console her but the gibsonian cop being of the new order passed on pretending not to notice for he was wise enough to know that these matters are beyond help so far as the power he represents is concerned though he rap the pavement with his nightstick till the sound goes up to the furthermost stars a madison square arabian night to carson chalmers in his apartment near the square phillips brought the evening mail beside the routine correspondence there were two items bearing the same foreign postmark one of the incoming parcels contained a photograph of a woman the other contained an interminable letter over which chalmers hung absorbed for a long time the letter was from another woman and it contained poisoned barbs sweetly dipped in honey and feathered with innuendoes concerning the photographed woman chalmers tore this letter into a thousand bits and began to wear out his expensive rug by striding back and forth upon it thus an animal from the jungle acts when it is caged and thus a caged man acts when he is housed in a jungle of doubt by and by the restless mood was overcome the rug was not an enchanted one for sixteen feet he could travel along it three thousand miles was beyond its power to aid phillips appeared he never entered he invariably appeared like a well oiled genie will you dine here sir or out he asked here said chalmers and in half an hour he listened glumly to the january blasts making an aeolian trombone of the empty street wait he said to the disappearing genie as i came home across the end of the square i saw many men standing there in rows there was one mounted upon something talking why do those men stand in rows and why are they there they are homeless men sir said phillips the man standing on the box tries to get lodging for them for the night people come around to listen and give him money then he sends as many as the money will pay for to some lodging house that is why they stand in rows they get sent to bed in order as they come by the time dinner is served said chalmers have one of those men here he will dine with me w w which began phillips stammering for the first time during his service choose one at random said chalmers you might see that he is reasonably sober and a certain amount of cleanliness will not be held against him that is all it was an unusual thing for carson chalmers to play the caliph but on that night he felt the inefficacy of conventional antidotes to melancholy something wanton and egregious something high flavored and arabian he must have to lighten his mood on the half hour phillips had finished his duties as slave of the lamp the waiters from the restaurant below had whisked aloft the delectable dinner the dining table laid for two glowed cheerily in the glow of the pink shaded candles and now phillips as though he ushered a cardinal or held in charge a burglar wafted in the shivering guest who had been haled from the line of mendicant lodgers it is a common thing to call such men wrecks if the comparison be used here it is the specific one of a derelict come to grief through fire even yet some flickering combustion illuminated the drifting hulk his face and hands had been recently washed a rite insisted upon by phillips as a memorial to the slaughtered conventions in the candle light he stood a flaw in the decorous fittings of the apartment his face was a sickly white covered almost to the eyes with a stubble the shade of a red irish setter s coat phillips s comb had failed to control the pale brown hair long matted and conformed to the contour of a constantly worn hat his eyes were full of a hopeless tricky defiance like that seen in a cur s that is cornered by his tormentors his shabby coat was buttoned high but a quarter inch of redeeming collar showed above it his manner was singularly free from embarrassment when chalmers rose from his chair across the round dining table if you will oblige me said the host i will be glad to have your company at dinner my name is plumer said the highway guest in harsh and aggressive tones if you re like me you like to know the name of the party you re dining with i was going on to say continued chalmers somewhat hastily that mine is chalmers will you sit opposite plumer of the ruffled plumes bent his knee for phillips to slide the chair beneath him he had an air of having sat at attended boards before phillips set out the anchovies and olives good barked plumer going to be in courses is it all right my jovial ruler of bagdad i m your scheherezade all the way to the toothpicks you re the first caliph with a genuine oriental flavor i ve struck since frost what luck and i was forty third in line i finished counting just as your welcome emissary arrived to bid me to the feast i had about as much chance of getting a bed to night as i have of being the next president how will you have the sad story of my life mr al raschid a chapter with each course or the whole edition with the cigars and coffee the situation does not seem a novel one to you said chalmers with a smile by the chin whiskers of the prophet no answered the guest now york s as full of cheap haroun al raschids as bagdad is of fleas i ve been held up for my story with a loaded meal pointed at my head twenty times catch anybody in new york giving you something for nothing they spell curiosity and charity with the same set of building blocks lots of em will stake you to a dime and chop suey and a few of em will play caliph to the tune of a top sirloin but every one of em will stand over you till they screw your autobiography out of you with foot notes appendix and unpublished fragments oh i know what to do when i see victuals coming toward me in little old bagdad on the subway i strike the asphalt three times with my forehead and get ready to spiel yarns for my supper i claim descent from the late tommy tucker who was forced to hand out vocal harmony for his pre digested wheaterina and spoopju i do not ask your story said chalmers i tell you frankly that it was a sudden whim that prompted me to send for some stranger to dine with me i assure you you will not suffer through any curiosity of mine oh fudge exclaimed the guest enthusiastically tackling his soup i don t mind it a bit i m a regular oriental magazine with a red cover and the leaves cut when the caliph walks abroad in fact we fellows in the bed line have a sort of union rate for things of this sort somebody s always stopping and wanting to know what brought us down so low in the world for a sandwich and a glass of beer i tell em that drink did it for corned beef and cabbage and a cup of coffee i give em the hard hearted landlord six months in the hospital lost job story a sirloin steak and a quarter for a bed gets the wall street tragedy of the swept away fortune and the gradual descent this is the first spread of this kind i ve stumbled against i haven t got a story to fit it i ll tell you what mr chalmers i m going to tell you the truth for this if you ll listen to it it ll be harder for you to believe than the made up ones an hour later the arabian guest lay back with a sigh of satisfaction while phillips brought the coffee and cigars and cleared the table did you ever hear of sherrard plumer he asked with a strange smile i remember the name said chalmers he was a painter i think of a good deal of prominence a few years ago five years said the guest then i went down like a chunk of lead i m sherrard plumer i sold the last portrait i painted for after that i couldn t have found a sitter for a gratis picture what was the trouble chalmers could not resist asking funny thing answered plumer grimly never quite understood it myself for a while i swam like a cork i broke into the swell crowd and got commissions right and left the newspapers called me a fashionable painter then the funny things began to happen whenever i finished a picture people would come to see it and whisper and look queerly at one another i soon found out what the trouble was i had a knack of bringing out in the face of a portrait the hidden character of the original i don t know how i did it i painted what i saw but i know it did me some of my sitters were fearfully enraged and refused their pictures i painted the portrait of a very beautiful and popular society dame when it was finished her husband looked at it with a peculiar expression on his face and the next week he sued for divorce i remember one case of a prominent banker who sat to me while i had his portrait on exhibition in my studio an acquaintance of his came in to look at it bless me says he does he really look like that i told him it was considered a faithful likeness i never noticed that expression about his eyes before said he i think i ll drop downtown and change my bank account he did drop down but the bank account was gone and so was mr banker it wasn t long till they put me out of business people don t want their secret meannesses shown up in a picture they can smile and twist their own faces and deceive you but the picture can t i couldn t get an order for another picture and i had to give up i worked as a newspaper artist for a while and then for a lithographer but my work with them got me into the same trouble if i drew from a photograph my drawing showed up characteristics and expressions that you couldn t find in the photo but i guess they were in the original all right the customers raised lively rows especially the women and i never could hold a job long so i began to rest my weary head upon the breast of old booze for comfort and pretty soon i was in the free bed line and doing oral fiction for hand outs among the food bazaars does the truthful statement weary thee o caliph i can turn on the wall street disaster stop if you prefer but that requires a tear and i m afraid i can t hustle one up after that good dinner no no said chalmers earnestly you interest me very much did all of your portraits reveal some unpleasant trait or were there some that did not suffer from the ordeal of your peculiar brush some yes said plumer children generally a good many women and a sufficient number of men all people aren t bad you know when they were all right the pictures were all right as i said i don t explain it but i m telling you facts on chalmers s writing table lay the photograph that he had received that day in the foreign mail ten minutes later he had plumer at work making a sketch from it in pastels at the end of an hour the artist rose and stretched wearily it s done he yawned you ll excuse me for being so long i got interested in the job lordy but i m tired no bed last night you know guess it ll have to be good night now o commander of the faithful chalmers went as far as the door with him and slipped some bills into his hand oh i ll take em said plumer all that s included in the fall thanks and for the very good dinner i shall sleep on feathers to night and dream of bagdad i hope it won t turn out to be a dream in the morning farewell most excellent caliph again chalmers paced restlessly upon his rug but his beat lay as far from the table whereon lay the pastel sketch as the room would permit twice thrice he tried to approach it but failed he could see the dun and gold and brown of the colors but there was a wall about it built by his fears that kept him at a distance he sat down and tried to calm himself he sprang up and rang for phillips there is a young artist in this building he said a mr reineman do you know which is his apartment top floor front sir said phillips go up and ask him to favor me with his presence here for a few minutes reineman came at once chalmers introduced himself mr reineman said he there is a little pastel sketch on yonder table i would be glad if you will give me your opinion of it as to its artistic merits and as a picture the young artist advanced to the table and took up the sketch chalmers half turned away leaning upon the back of a chair how do you find it he asked slowly as a drawing said the artist i can t praise it enough it s the work of a master bold and fine and true it puzzles me a little i haven t seen any pastel work near as good in years the face man the subject the original what would you say of that the face said reineman is the face of one of god s own angels may i ask who my wife shouted chalmers wheeling and pouncing upon the astonished artist gripping his hand and pounding his back she is traveling in europe take that sketch boy and paint the picture of your life from it and leave the price to me the rubaiyat of a scotch highball this document is intended to strike somewhere between a temperance lecture and the bartender s guide relative to the latter drink shall swell the theme and be set forth in abundance agreeably to the former not an elbow shall be crooked bob babbitt was off the stuff which means as you will discover by referring to the unabridged dictionary of bohemia that he had cut out the booze that he was on the water wagon the reason for bob s sudden attitude of hostility toward the demon rum as the white ribboners miscall whiskey see the bartender s guide should be of interest to reformers and saloon keepers there is always hope for a man who when sober will not concede or acknowledge that he was ever drunk but when a man will say in the apt words of the phrase distiller i had a beautiful skate on last night you will have to put stuff in his coffee as well as pray for him one evening on his way home babbitt dropped in at the broadway bar that he liked best always there were three or four fellows there from the downtown offices whom he knew and then there would be high balls and stories and he would hurry home to dinner a little late but feeling good and a little sorry for the poor standard oil company on this evening as he entered he heard some one say babbitt was in last night as full as a boiled owl babbitt walked to the bar and saw in the mirror that his face was as white as chalk for the first time he had looked truth in the eyes others had lied to him he had dissembled with himself he was a drunkard and had not known it what he had fondly imagined was a pleasant exhilaration had been maudlin intoxication his fancied wit had been drivel his gay humors nothing but the noisy vagaries of a sot but never again a glass of seltzer he said to the bartender a little silence fell upon the group of his cronies who had been expecting him to join them going off the stuff bob one of them asked politely and with more formality than the highballs ever called forth yes said babbitt some one of the group took up the unwashed thread of a story he had been telling the bartender shoved over a dime and a nickel change from the quarter ungarnished with his customary smile and babbitt walked out now babbitt had a home and a wife but that is another story and i will tell you that story which will show you a better habit and a worse story than you could find in the man who invented the phrase it began away up in sullivan county where so many rivers and so much trouble begins or begin how would you say that it was july and jessie was a summer boarder at the mountain squint hotel and bob who was just out of college saw her one day and they were married in september that s the tabloid novel one swallow of water and it s gone but those july days let the exclamation point expound it for i shall not for particulars you might read up on romeo and juliet and abraham lincoln s thrilling sonnet about you can fool some of the people c and darwin s works but one thing i must tell you about both of them were mad over omar s rubaiyat they knew every verse of the old bluffer by heart not consecutively but picking em out here and there as you fork the mushrooms in a fifty cent steak a la bordelaise sullivan county is full of rocks and trees and jessie used to sit on them and please be good used to sit on the rocks and bob had a way of standing behind her with his hands over her shoulders holding her hands and his face close to hers and they would repeat over and over their favorite verses of the old tent maker they saw only the poetry and philosophy of the lines then indeed they agreed that the wine was only an image and that what was meant to be celebrated was some divinity or maybe love or life however at that time neither of them had tasted the stuff that goes with a sixty cent table d hote where was i oh they married and came to new york bob showed his college diploma and accepted a position filling inkstands in a lawyer s office at a week at the end of two years he had worked up to and gotten his first taste of bohemia the kind that won t stand the borax and formaldehyde tests they had two furnished rooms and a little kitchen to jess accustomed to the mild but beautiful savor of a country town the dreggy bohemia was sugar and spice she hung fish seines on the walls of her rooms and bought a rakish looking sideboard and learned to play the banjo twice or thrice a week they dined at french or italian tables d hote in a cloud of smoke and brag and unshorn hair jess learned to drink a cocktail in order to get the cherry at home she smoked a cigarette after dinner she learned to pronounce chianti and leave her olive stones for the waiter to pick up once she essayed to say la la la in a crowd but got only as far as the second one they met one or two couples while dining out and became friendly with them the sideboard was stocked with scotch and rye and a liqueur they had their new friends in to dinner and all were laughing at nothing by a m some plastering fell in the room below them for which bob had to pay thus they footed it merrily on the ragged frontiers of the country that has no boundary lines or government and soon bob fell in with his cronies and learned to keep his foot on the little rail six inches above the floor for an hour or so every afternoon before he went home drink always rubbed him the right way and he would reach his rooms as jolly as a sandboy jessie would meet him at the door and generally they would dance some insane kind of a rigadoon about the floor by way of greeting once when bob s feet became confused and he tumbled headlong over a foot stool jessie laughed so heartily and long that he had to throw all the couch pillows at her to make her hush in such wise life was speeding for them on the day when bob babbitt first felt the power that the giftie gi ed him but let us get back to our lamb and mint sauce when bob got home that evening he found jessie in a long apron cutting up a lobster for the newburg usually when bob came in mellow from his hour at the bar his welcome was hilarious though somewhat tinctured with scotch smoke by screams and snatches of song and certain audible testimonials of domestic felicity was his advent proclaimed when she heard his foot on the stairs the old maid in the hall room always stuffed cotton into her ears at first jessie had shrunk from the rudeness and favor of these spiritual greetings but as the fog of the false bohemia gradually encompassed her she came to accept them as love s true and proper greeting bob came in without a word smiled kissed her neatly but noiselessly took up a paper and sat down in the hall room the old maid held her two plugs of cotton poised filled with anxiety jessie dropped lobster and knife and ran to him with frightened eyes what s the matter bob are you ill not at all dear then what s the matter with you nothing hearken brethren when she who has a right to ask interrogates you concerning a change she finds in your mood answer her thus tell her that you in a sudden rage have murdered your grandmother tell her that you have robbed orphans and that remorse has stricken you tell her your fortune is swept away that you are beset by enemies by bunions by any kind of malevolent fate but do not if peace and happiness are worth as much as a grain of mustard seed to you do not answer her nothing jessie went back to the lobster in silence she cast looks of darkest suspicion at bob he had never acted that way before when dinner was on the table she set out the bottle of scotch and the glasses bob declined tell you the truth jess he said i ve cut out the drink help yourself of course if you don t mind i ll try some of the seltzer straight you ve stopped drinking she said looking at him steadily and unsmilingly what for it wasn t doing me any good said bob don t you approve of the idea jessie raised her eyebrows and one shoulder slightly entirely she said with a sculptured smile i could not conscientiously advise any one to drink or smoke or whistle on sunday the meal was finished almost in silence bob tried to make talk but his efforts lacked the stimulus of previous evenings he felt miserable and once or twice his eye wandered toward the bottle but each time the scathing words of his bibulous friend sounded in his ear and his mouth set with determination jessie felt the change deeply the essence of their lives seemed to have departed suddenly the restless fever the false gayety the unnatural excitement of the shoddy bohemia in which they had lived had dropped away in the space of the popping of a cork she stole curious and forlorn glances at the dejected bob who bore the guilty look of at least a wife beater or a family tyrant after dinner the colored maid who came in daily to perform such chores cleared away the things jessie with an unreadable countenance brought back the bottle of scotch and the glasses and a bowl of cracked ice and set them on the table may i ask she said with some of the ice in her tones whether i am to be included in your sudden spasm of goodness if not i ll make one for myself it s rather chilly this evening for some reason oh come now jess said bob good naturedly don t be too rough on me help yourself by all means there s no danger of your overdoing it but i thought there was with me and that s why i quit have yours and then let s get out the banjo and try over that new quickstep i ve heard said jessie in the tones of the oracle that drinking alone is a pernicious habit no i don t think i feel like playing this evening if we are going to reform we may as well abandon the evil habit of banjo playing too she took up a book and sat in her little willow rocker on the other side of the table neither of them spoke for half an hour and then bob laid down his paper and got up with a strange absent look on his face and went behind her chair and reached over her shoulders taking her hands in his and laid his face close to hers in a moment to jessie the walls of the seine hung room vanished and she saw the sullivan county hills and rills bob felt her hands quiver in his as he began the verse from old omar come fill the cup and in the fire of spring the winter garment of repentance fling the bird of time has but a little way to fly and lo the bird is on the wing and then he walked to the table and poured a stiff drink of scotch into a glass but in that moment a mountain breeze had somehow found its way in and blown away the mist of the false bohemia jessie leaped and with one fierce sweep of her hand sent the bottle and glasses crashing to the floor the same motion of her arm carried it around bob s neck where it met its mate and fastened tight oh my god bobbie not that verse i see now i wasn t always such a fool was i the other one boy the one that says remould it to the heart s desire say that one to the heart s desire i know that one said bob it goes ah love could you and i with him conspire to grasp this sorry scheme of things entire would not we let me finish it said jessie would not we shatter it to bits and then remould it nearer to the heart s desire it s shattered all right said bob crunching some glass under his heel in some dungeon below the accurate ear of mrs pickens the landlady located the smash it s that wild mr babbitt coming home soused again she said and he s got such a nice little wife too the pendulum eighty first street let em out please yelled the shepherd in blue a flock of citizen sheep scrambled out and another flock scrambled aboard ding ding the cattle cars of the manhattan elevated rattled away and john perkins drifted down the stairway of the station with the released flock john walked slowly toward his flat slowly because in the lexicon of his daily life there was no such word as perhaps there are no surprises awaiting a man who has been married two years and lives in a flat as he walked john perkins prophesied to himself with gloomy and downtrodden cynicism the foregone conclusions of the monotonous day katy would meet him at the door with a kiss flavored with cold cream and butter scotch he would remove his coat sit upon a macadamized lounge and read in the evening paper of russians and japs slaughtered by the deadly linotype for dinner there would be pot roast a salad flavored with a dressing warranted not to crack or injure the leather stewed rhubarb and the bottle of strawberry marmalade blushing at the certificate of chemical purity on its label after dinner katy would show him the new patch in her crazy quilt that the iceman had cut for her off the end of his four in hand at half past seven they would spread newspapers over the furniture to catch the pieces of plastering that fell when the fat man in the flat overhead began to take his physical culture exercises exactly at eight hickey mooney of the vaudeville team unbooked in the flat across the hall would yield to the gentle influence of delirium tremens and begin to overturn chairs under the delusion that hammerstein was pursuing them with a five hundred dollar a week contract then the gent at the window across the air shaft would get out his flute the nightly gas leak would steal forth to frolic in the highways the dumbwaiter would slip off its trolley the janitor would drive mrs zanowitski s five children once more across the yalu the lady with the champagne shoes and the skye terrier would trip downstairs and paste her thursday name over her bell and letter box and the evening routine of the frogmore flats would be under way john perkins knew these things would happen and he knew that at a quarter past eight he would summon his nerve and reach for his hat and that his wife would deliver this speech in a querulous tone now where are you going i d like to know john perkins thought i d drop up to mccloskey s he would answer and play a game or two of pool with the fellows of late such had been john perkins s habit at ten or eleven he would return sometimes katy would be asleep sometimes waiting up ready to melt in the crucible of her ire a little more gold plating from the wrought steel chains of matrimony for these things cupid will have to answer when he stands at the bar of justice with his victims from the frogmore flats to night john perkins encountered a tremendous upheaval of the commonplace when he reached his door no katy was there with her affectionate confectionate kiss the three rooms seemed in portentous disorder all about lay her things in confusion shoes in the middle of the floor curling tongs hair bows kimonos powder box jumbled together on dresser and chairs this was not katy s way with a sinking heart john saw the comb with a curling cloud of her brown hair among its teeth some unusual hurry and perturbation must have possessed her for she always carefully placed these combings in the little blue vase on the mantel to be some day formed into the coveted feminine rat hanging conspicuously to the gas jet by a string was a folded paper john seized it it was a note from his wife running thus dear john i just had a telegram saying mother is very sick i am going to take the train brother sam is going to meet me at the depot there there is cold mutton in the ice box i hope it isn t her quinzy again pay the milkman cents she had it bad last spring don t forget to write to the company about the gas meter and your good socks are in the top drawer i will write to morrow hastily katy never during their two years of matrimony had he and katy been separated for a night john read the note over and over in a dumbfounded way here was a break in a routine that had never varied and it left him dazed there on the back of a chair hung pathetically empty and formless the red wrapper with black dots that she always wore while getting the meals her week day clothes had been tossed here and there in her haste a little paper bag of her favorite butterscotch lay with its string yet unwound a daily paper sprawled on the floor gaping rectangularly where a railroad time table had been clipped from it everything in the room spoke of a loss of an essence gone of its soul and life departed john perkins stood among the dead remains with a queer feeling of desolation in his heart he began to set the rooms tidy as well as he could when he touched her clothes a thrill of something like terror went through him he had never thought what existence would be without katy she had become so thoroughly annealed into his life that she was like the air he breathed necessary but scarcely noticed now without warning she was gone vanished as completely absent as if she had never existed of course it would be only for a few days or at most a week or two but it seemed to him as if the very hand of death had pointed a finger at his secure and uneventful home john dragged the cold mutton from the ice box made coffee and sat down to a lonely meal face to face with the strawberry marmalade s shameless certificate of purity bright among withdrawn blessings now appeared to him the ghosts of pot roasts and the salad with tan polish dressing his home was dismantled a quinzied mother in law had knocked his lares and penates sky high after his solitary meal john sat at a front window he did not care to smoke outside the city roared to him to come join in its dance of folly and pleasure the night was his he might go forth unquestioned and thrum the strings of jollity as free as any gay bachelor there he might carouse and wander and have his fling until dawn if he liked and there would be no wrathful katy waiting for him bearing the chalice that held the dregs of his joy he might play pool at mccloskey s with his roistering friends until aurora dimmed the electric bulbs if he chose the hymeneal strings that had curbed him always when the frogmore flats had palled upon him were loosened katy was gone john perkins was not accustomed to analyzing his emotions but as he sat in his katy bereft x parlor he hit unerringly upon the keynote of his discomfort he knew now that katy was necessary to his happiness his feeling for her lulled into unconsciousness by the dull round of domesticity had been sharply stirred by the loss of her presence has it not been dinned into us by proverb and sermon and fable that we never prize the music till the sweet voiced bird has flown or in other no less florid and true utterances i m a double dyed dub mused john perkins the way i ve been treating katy off every night playing pool and bumming with the boys instead of staying home with her the poor girl here all alone with nothing to amuse her and me acting that way john perkins you re the worst kind of a shine i m going to make it up for the little girl i ll take her out and let her see some amusement and i ll cut out the mccloskey gang right from this minute yes there was the city roaring outside for john perkins to come dance in the train of momus and at mccloskey s the boys were knocking the balls idly into the pockets against the hour for the nightly game but no primrose way nor clicking cue could woo the remorseful soul of perkins the bereft the thing that was his lightly held and half scorned had been taken away from him and he wanted it backward to a certain man named adam whom the cherubim bounced from the orchard could perkins the remorseful trace his descent near the right hand

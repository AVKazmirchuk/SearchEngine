the story of his abdication from society the story pruned of his moral philosophy deserves no more than the slightest touch it is no new tale that of the gambler s declension during one night s sitting he lost and then had imperilled a certain amount of his employer s money which by accident he carried with him he continued to lose to the last wager and then began to gain leaving the game winner to a somewhat formidable sum the same night his employer s safe was robbed a search was had the winnings of lorison were found in his room their total forming an accusative nearness to the sum purloined he was taken tried and through incomplete evidence released smutched with the sinister devoirs of a dis agreeing jury it is not in the unjust accusation he said to the girl that my burden lies but in the knowledge that from the moment i staked the first dollar of the firm s money i was a criminal no matter whether i lost or won you see why it is impossible for me to speak of love to her it is a sad thing said norah after a little pause to think what very good people there are in the world good said lorison i was thinking of this superior person whom you say you love she must be a very poor sort of creature i do not understand nearly she continued as poor a sort of creature as yourself you do not understand said lorison removing his hat and sweeping back his fine light hair suppose she loved me in return and were willing to marry me think if you can what would follow never a day would pass but she would be reminded of her sacrifice i would read a condescension in her smile a pity even in her affection that would madden me no the thing would stand between us forever only equals should mate i could never ask her to come down upon my lower plane an arc light faintly shone upon lorison s face an illumination from within also pervaded it the girl saw the rapt ascetic look it was the face either of sir galahad or sir fool quite starlike she said is this unapproachable angel really too high to be grasped by me yes she faced him suddenly my dear friend would you prefer your star fallen lorison made a wide gesture you push me to the bald fact he declared you are not in sympathy with my argument but i will answer you so if i could reach my particular star to drag it down i would not do it but if it were fallen i would pick it up and thank heaven for the privilege they were silent for some minutes norah shivered and thrust her hands deep into the pockets of her jacket lorison uttered a remorseful exclamation i m not cold she said i was just thinking i ought to tell you something you have selected a strange confidante but you cannot expect a chance acquain ance picked up in a doubtful restaurant to be an angel norah cried lorison let me go on you have told me about yourself we have been such good friends i must tell you now what i never wanted you to know i am worse than you are i was on the stage i sang in the chorus i was pretty bad i guess i stole diamonds from the prima donna they arrested me i gave most of them up and they let me go i drank wine every night a great deal i was very wicked but lorison knelt quickly by her side and took her hands dear norah he said exultantly it is you it is you i love you never guessed it did you tis you i meant all the time now i can speak let me make you forget the past we have both suffered let us shut out the world and live for each other norah do you hear me say i love you in spite of rather say because of it you have come out of your past noble and good your heart is an angel s give it to me a little while ago you feared the future too much to even speak but for you not for myself can you love me she cast herself wildly sobbing upon his breast better than life than truth itself than every thing and my own past said lorison with a note of solicitude can you forgive and i answered you that she whispered when i told you i loved you she leaned away and looked thought fully at him if i had not told you about myself would you have would you no he interrupted i would never have let you know i loved you i would never have asked you this norah will you be my wife she wept again oh believe me i am good now i am no longer wicked i will be the best wife in the world don t think i am bad any more if you do i shall die i shall die while he was consoling her she brightened up eager and impetuous will vou marry me to night she said will you prove it that way i have a reason for wishing it to be to night will you of one of two things was this exceeding frankness the outcome either of importunate brazenness or of utter innocence the lover s perspective contained only the one the sooner said lorison the happier i shall be what is there to do she asked what do you have to get come you should know her energy stirred the dreamer to action a city directory first he cried gayly to find where the man lives who gives licenses to happiness we will go together and rout him out cabs cars policemen telephones and ministers shall aid us father rogan shall marry us said the girl with ardour i will take you to him an hour later the two stood at the open doorway of an immense gloomy brick building in a narrow and lonely street the license was tight in norah s hand wait here a moment she said till i find father rogan she plunged into the black hallway and the lover was left standing as it were on one leg outside his impa tience was not greatly taxed gazing curiously into what seemed the hallway to erebus he was presently reassured by a stream of light that bisected the darkness far down the passage then he heard her call and fluttered lampward like the moth she beckoned him through a doorway into the room whence emanated the light the room was bare of nearly everything except books which had subjugated all its space here and there little spots of territory had been reconquered an elderly bald man with a superlatively calm remote eye stood by a table with a book in his hand his finger still marking a page his dress was sombre and appertained to a religious order his eye denoted an acquaintance with the perspective father rogan said norah this is he the two of ye said father rogan want to get married they did not deny it he married them the cere mony was quickly done one who could have witnessed it and felt its scope might have trembled at the terrible inadequacy of it to rise to the dignity of its endless chain of results afterward the priest spake briefly as if by rote of certain other civil and legal addenda that either might or should at a later time cap the ceremony lorison tendered a fee which was declined and before the door closed after the departing couple father rogan s book popped open again where his finger marked it in the dark hall norah whirled and clung to her com panion tearful will you never never be sorry at last she was reassured at the first light they reached upon the street she asked the time just as she had each night lorison looked at his watch half past eight lorison thought it was from habit that she guided their steps toward the corner where they always parted but arrived there she hesitated and then released his arm a drug store stood on the corner its bright soft light shone upon them please leave me here as usual to night said norah sweetly i must i would rather you would you will not object at six to morrow evening i will meet you at antonio s i want to sit with vou there once more and then i will go where you say she gave him a bewildering bright smile and walked swiftly away surely it needed all the strength of her charm to carry off this astounding behaviour it was no discredit to lorison s strength of mind that his head began to whirl pocketing his hands he rambled vacuously over to the druggist s windows and began assiduously to spell over the names of the patent medicines therein displayed as soon as be had recovered his wits he proceeded along the street in an aimless fashion after drifting for two or three squares he flowed into a somewhat more pretentious thoroughfare a way much frequented by him in his solitary ramblings for here was a row of slops devoted to traffic in goods of the widest range of choice handiworks of art skill and fancy products of nature and labour from every zone here for a time he loitered among the conspicuous windows where was set emphasized bv congested floods of light the cunningest spoil of the interiors there were few passers and of this lorison was glad he was not of the world for a long time he had touched his fellow man only at the gear of a levelled cog wheel at right angles and upon a different axis he had dropped into a distinctly new orbit the stroke of ill fortune had acted upon him in effect as a blow delivered upon the apex of a certain ingenious toy the musical top which when thus buffeted while spinning gives forth with scarcely retarded motion a complete change of key and chord strolling along the pacific avenue he experienced singular supernatural calm accompanied by an unusual a activity of brain reflecting upon recent affairs be assured himself of his happiness in having won for a bride the one he had so greatly desired yet he wondered mildly at his dearth of active emotion her strange behaviour in abandoning him without valid excuse on his bridal eve aroused in him only a vague and curious speculation again he found himself contemplating with complaisant serenity the incidents of her somewhat lively career his perspective seemed to have been queerly shifted as he stood before a window near a corner his ears were assailed by a waxing clamour and commotion he stood close to the window to allow passage to the cause of the hubbub a procession of human beings which rounded the corner aid headed in his direction he perceived a salient hue of blue and a glitter of brass about a central figure of dazzling white and silver and a ragged wake of black bobbing figures two ponderous policemen were conducting between them a woman dressed as if for the stage in a short white satiny skirt reaching to the knees pink stockings and a sort of sleeveless bodice bright with relucent armour like scales upon her curly light hair was perched at a rollicking angle a shining tin helmet the costume was to be instantly recognized as one of those amazing con ceptions to which competition has harried the inventors of the spectacular ballet one of the officers bore a long cloak upon his axm which doubtless had been intended to veil the i candid attractions of their effulgent prisoner but for some reason it had not been called into use to the vociferous delight of the tail of the procession compelled by a sudden and vigorous movement of the woman the parade halted before the window by which lorison stood he saw that she was young and at the first glance was deceived by a sophistical prettiness of her face which waned before a more judicious scrutiny her look was bold and reckless and upon her countenance where yet the contours of youth survived were the finger marks of old age s credentialed courier late hours the young woman fixed her unshrinking gaze upon lorison and called to him in the voice of the wronged heroine in straits say you look like a good fellow come and put up the bail won t you i ve done nothing to get pinched for it s all a mistake see how they re treating me you won t be sorry if you ll help me out of this think of your sister or your girl being dragged along the streets this way i say come along now like a good fellow it may be that lorison in spite of the unconvincing bathos of this appeal showed a sympathetic face for one of the officers left the woman s side and went over to him it s all right sir he said in a husky confidential tone she s the right party we took her after the first act at the green light theatre on a wire from the chief of police of chicago it s only a square or two to the station her rig s pretty bad but she refused to change clothes or rather added the officer with a smile to put on some i thought i d explain matters to you so you wouldn t think she was being imposed upon what is the charge asked lorison grand larceny diamonds her husband is a jeweller in chicago she cleaned his show case of the sparklers and skipped with a comic opera troupe the policeman perceiving that the interest of the entire group of spectators was centred upon himself and lorison their conference being regarded as a possible new com plication was fain to prolong the situation which reflected his own importance by a little afterpiece of philosophical comment a gentleman like you sir he went on affably would never notice it but it comes in my line to observe what an immense amount of trouble is made by that com bination i mean the stage diamonds and light headed women who aren t satisfied with good homes i tell you sir a man these days and nights wants to know what his women folks are up to the policeman smiled a good night and returned to the side of his charge who had been intently watching lorison s face during the conversation no doubt for some indication of his intention to render succour now at the failure of the sign and at the movement made to continue the ignominious progress she abandoned hope and addressed him thus pointedly you damn chalk faced quitter you was thinking of giving me a hand but you let the cop talk you out of it the first word you re a dandy to tie to say if you ever get a girl she ll have a picnic won t she work you to the queen s taste oh my she concluded with a taunting shrill laugh that rasped lorison like a saw the policemen urged her forward the delighted train of gaping followers closed up the rear and the captive amazon accepting her fate extended the scope of her maledictions so that none in hearing might seem to be slighted then there came upon lorison an overwhelming revulsion of his perspective it may be that he had been ripe for it that the abnormal condition of mind in which he had for so long existed was already about to revert to its balance however it is certain that the events of the last few minutes had furnished the channel if not the impetus for the change the initial determining influence had been so small a thing as the fact and manner of his having been approached by the officer that agent had by the style of his accost restored the loiterer to his former place in society in an instant he had been transformed from a somewhat rancid prowler along the fishy side streets of gentility into an honest gentleman with whom even so lordly a guardian of the peace might agreeably exchange the compliments this then first broke the spell and set thrilling in him a resurrected longing for the fellowship of his kind and the rewards of the virtuous to what end he vehemently asked himself was this fanciful self accusation this empty renunciation this moral squeamishness through which he had been led to abandon what was his heritage in life and not beyond his deserts technically he was uncondemned his sole guilty spot was in thought rather than deed and cognizance of it unshared by others for what good moral or sentimental did he slink retreating like the hedgehog from his own shadow to and fro in this musty bohemia that lacked even the picturesque but the thing that struck home and set him raging was the part played by the amazonian prisoner to the counterpart of that astounding belligerent identical at least in the way of experience to one by her own confession thus far fallen had he not three hours since been united in marriage how desirable and natural it had seemed to him then and how monstrous it seemed now how the words of diamond thief number two yet burned in his ears if you ever get a cirl she ll have a picnic what did that that this women instinc tively knew him for one they could hoodwink still again there reverberated the policeman s sapient contribution to his agony a man these days and nights wants to know what his women folks are up to oh yes he had been a fool he had looked at things from the wrong standpoint but the wildest note in all the clamour was struck by pain s forefinger jealousy now at least he felt that keenest sting a mounting love unworthily bestowed whatever she might be he loved her he bore in his own breast his doom a grating comic flavour to his pre dicament struck him suddenly and he laughed creakingly as he swung down the echoing pavement an impetuous desire to act to battle with his fate seized him he stopped upon his heel and smote his palms together triumphantly his wife was where but there was a tangible link an outlet more or less navigable through which his derelict ship of matrimony might yet be safely towed the priest like all imaginative men with pliable natures lorison was when thoroughly stirred apt to become tempest uous with a high and stubborn indignation upon him be retraced his steps to the intersecting street by which he had come down this he hurried to the corner where he had parted with an astringent grimace tinctured the thought his wife thence still back he harked follow ing through an unfamiliar district his stimulated recollec tions of the way they had come from that preposterous wedding many times he went abroad and nosed his way back to the trail furious at last when he reached the dark calamitous building in which his madness had culminated and found the black hallway he dashed down it perceiving no light or sound but he raised his voice hailing loudly reckless of everything but that he should find the old mischief maker with the eyes that looked too far awav to see the disaster he had wrought the door opened and in the stream of light father rogan stood his book in hand with his finger marking the place ah cried lorison you are the man i want i had a wife of you a few hours ago i would not trouble you but i neglected to note how it was done will you oblige me with the information whether the business is beyond remedy come inside said the priest there are other lodgers in the house who might prefer sleep to even a gratified curiosity lorison entered the room and took the chair offered him the priest s eyes looked a courteous interrogation i must apologize again said the young man for so soon intruding upon you with my marital infelicities but as my wife has neglected to furnish me with her address i am deprived of the legitimate recourse of a family row i am quite a plain man said father rogan pleas antly but i do not see how i am to ask you questions pardon my indirectness said lorison i will ask one in this room to night you pronounced me to be a husband you afterward spoke of additional rites or performances that either should or could be effected i paid little attention to your words then but i am hungry to hear them repeated now as matters stand am i married past all help you are as legally and as firmly bound said the priest as though it had been done in a cathedral in the presence of thousands the additional observances i referred to are not necessary to the strictest legality of the act but were advised as a precaution for the future for convenience of proof in such contingencies as wills inheritances and the like lorison laughed harshly many thanks he said then there is no mistake and i am the happy benedict i suppose i should go stand upon the bridal corner and when my wife gets through walking the streets she will look me up father rogan regarded him calmly my son he said when a man and woman come to me to be married i always marry them i do this for the sake of other people whom they might go away and marry if they did not marry each other as you see i do not seek your confidence but your case seems to me to be one not altogether devoid of interest very few marriages that have come to my notice have brought such well expressed regret within so short a time i will hazard one question were you not under the impression that you loved the lady you married at the time you did so loved her cried lorison wildly never so well as now though she told me she deceived and sinned and stole never more than now when perhaps she is laughing at the fool she cajoled and left with scarcely a word to return to god only knows what particular line of her former folly father rooan answered nothing during the silence that succeeded he sat with a quiet expectation beaming in his full lambent eye if you would listen began lorison the priest held up his hand as i hoped he said i thought you would trust me wait but a moment he brought a long clay pipe filled and lighted it now my son he said lorison poured a twelve month s accumulated con fidence into father rogan s ear he told all not sparing himself or omitting the facts of his past the events of the night or his disturbing conjectures and fears the main point said the priest when he had con cluded seems to me to be this are you reasonably sure that you love this woman whom you have married why exclaimed lorisoii rising impulsively to his feet why should i deny it but look at me am fish flesh or fowl that is the main point to me assure you i understand you said the priest also risino and laying down his pipe the situation is one that has taxed the endurance of much older men than you in fact especially much older men than you i will try to relieve you from it and this night you shall see for yourself into exactly what predicament you have fallen and how you shall possibly be extricated there is no evidence so credible as that of the eyesight father rogan moved about the room and donned a soft black hat buttoning his coat to his throat he laid his hand on the doorknob let us walk he said the two went out upon the street the priest turned his face down it and lorison walked with him through a squalid district where the houses loomed awry and desoiate looking high above them presently they turned into a less dismal side street where the houses were smaller and though hinting of the most meagre comfort lacked the concentrated wretchedness of the more populous byways at a segregated two story house father rogan halted and mounted the steps with the confidence of a familiar visitor he ushered lorison into a narrow hallway faintly lighted by a cobwebbed hanging lamp almost immediately a door to the right opened and a dingy irish woman protruded her head good evening to ye mistress geehan said the priest unconsciously it seemed falling into a delicately flavoured brogue and is it yourself can tell me if norah has gone out again the night maybe oh it s yer blissid reverence sure and i can tell ye the same the purty darlin wint out as usual but a bit later and she says mother geehan says she it s me last noight out praise the saints this noight is and oh yer reverence the swate beautiful drame of a dress she had this toime white satin and silk and ribbons and lace about the neck and arrums twas a sin yer reverence the gold was spint upon it the priest heard lorison catch his breath painfully and a faint smile flickered across his own clean cut mouth well then mistress geehan said he i ll just step upstairs and see the bit boy for a minute and i ll take this gentleman up with me he s awake thin said the woman i ve just come down from sitting wid him the last hour tilling him fine shtories of ould county tyrone tis a greedy gos soon it is yer riverence for me shtories small the doubt said father rogan there s no rocking would put him to slape the quicker i m thinking amid the woman s shrill protest against the retort the two men ascended the steep stairway the priest pushed open the door of a room near its top is that you already sister drawled a sweet childish voice from the darkness it s only ould father denny come to see ye darlin and a foine gentleman i ve brought to make ye a gr r and call and ye resaves us fast aslape in bed shame on yez manners oh father denny is that you i m glad and will you light the lamp please it s on the table by the door and quit talking like mother geehan father denny the priest lit the lamp and lorison saw a tiny towsled haired boy with a thin delicate face sitting up in a small bed in a corner quickly also his rapid glance con sidered the room and its contents it was furnished with more than comfort and its adornments plainly indicated a woman s discerning taste an open door beyond revealed the blackness of an adjoining room s interior the boy clutched both of father rogan s hands i m so glad you came he said but why did you come in the night did sister send you off wid ye am i to be sint about at me age as was terence mcshane of ballymahone i come on me own r r responsibility lorison had also advanced to the boy s bedside he was fond of children and the wee fellow laving himself down to sleep alone ill that dark room stirred his heart aren t you afraid little man he asked stooping down beside him sometimes answered the boy with a shy smile when the rats make too much noise but nearly every night when sister goes out molt her geehan stays a while with me and tells me funny stories i m not often afraid sir this brave little gentleman said father rogan is a scholar of mine every day from half past six to half past eight when sister comes for him he stops in my study and we find out what s in the inside of books he knows multiplication division and fractions and he s troubling me to begin wid the chronicles of ciaran of clonmaciioise corurac mccullenan and cuan o loc hain the gr r reat irish histhorians the boy was evidently accustomed to the priest s celtic pleasantries a little appreciative grin was all the attention the insin nation of pedantry received lorison to have saved his life could not have put to the child one of those vital questions that were wildly beating about unanswered in his own brain the little fellow was very like norah he had the same shining hair and candid eyes oh father denny cried the boy suddenly i forgot to tell you sister is not going away at night any more she told me so when she kissed me good night as she was leaving and she said she was so happy and then she cried wasn t that queer but i m glad aren t you yes lad and now ye omadhaun go to sleep and say good night we must be going which shall i do first father denny faith he s caught me again wait till i get the sassenach into the annals of tageruach the hagiographer i ll give him enough of the irish idiom to make him more respectful the light was out and the small brave voice bidding them good night from the dark room they groped downstairs and tore away from the garrulity of mother geehan again the priest steered them through the dim ways but this time in another direction his conductor was serenely silent and lorison followed his example to the extent of seldom speaking serene he could not be his heart beat suffocatingly in his breast the following of this blind menacing trail was pregnant with he knew not what humiliating revelation to be delivered at its end they came into a more pretentious street where trade it could be surmised flourished by day and again the priest paused this time before a lofty building whose great doors and windows in the lowest floor were carefully shuttered and barred its higher apertures were dark save in the third story the windows of which were bril liantly lighted lorison s ear caught a distant regular pleasing thrumming as of music above they stood at an angle of the building up along the side nearest them mounted an iron stairway at its top was an upright illuminated parallelogram father rogan had stopped and stood musing i will say this much he remarked thoughtfully i believe you to be a better man than you think yourself to be and a better man than i thought some hours ago but do not take this he added with a smile as much praise i promised you a possible deliverance from an unhappy perplexity i will have to modify that promise i can only remove the mystery that enhanced that per plexity your deliverance depends upon yourself come he led his companion up the stairway halfway up lorison caught him by the sleeve remember he gasped i love that woman you desired to know i go on the priest reached the landing at the top of the stairway lorison behind him saw that the illuminated space was the glass upper half of a door opening into the lighted room the rhythmic music increased as they neared it the stairs shook with the mellow vibrations lorison stopped breathing when he set foot upon the highest step for the priest stood aside and motioned him to look through the glass of the door his eye accustomed to the darkness met first a blind ing glare and then he made out the faces and forms of many people amid an extravagant display of splendid robings billowy laces brilliant hued finery ribbons silks and misty drapery and then he caught the mean ing of that jarring hum and he saw the tired pale happy face of his wife bending as were a score of others over her sewing machine toiling toiling here was the folly she pursued and the end of his quest but not his deliverance though even then remorse struck him his shamed soul fluttered once more before it retired to make room for the other and better one for to temper his thrill of joy the shine of the satin and the glimmer of ornaments recalled the disturbing figure of the bespangled amazon and the base duplicate histories it by the glare of footlights and stolen diamonds it is past the wisdom of him who only sets the scenes either to praise or blame the man but this time his love over came his scruples he took a quick step and reached out his hand for the doorknob father rogan was quicker to arrest it and draw him back you use my trust in you queerly said the priest sternly what are you about to do i am going to my wife said lorison let me pass listen said the priest holding him firmly by the arm i am about to put you in possession of a piece of knowledge of which thus far you have scarcely proved deserving i do not think you ever will but i will not dwell upon that you see in that room the woman you married working for a frugal living for herself and a generous comfort for an idolized brother this building belongs to the chief costumer of the city for months the advance orders for the coming mardi gras festivals have kept the work going day and night i myself secured employment here for norah she toils here each night from nine o clock until daylight and besides carries home with her some of the finer costumes requiring more delicate needlework and works there part of the day somehow you two have remained strangely ignorant of each other s lives are you convinced now that your wife is not walking the streets let me go to her cried lorison again struggling and beg her forgiveness sir said the priest do you owe me nothing be quiet it seems so often that heaven lets fall its choicest gifts into hands that must be taught to hold them listen again you forgot that repentant sin must not comprom ise but look up for redemption to the purest and best you went to her with the fine spun sophistry that peace could be found in a mutual guilt and she fearful of losing what her heart so craved thought it worth the price to buy it with a desperate pure beautiful lie i have known her since the day she was born she is as innocent and unsullied in life and deed as a holy saint in that lowly street where she dwells she first saw the light and she has lived there ever since spending her days in generous self sacrifice for others och ye spalpeen continued father rogan raising his finger in kindly anger at lorison what for i wonder could she be after making a fool of hersilf and shamin her swate soul with lies for the like of you sir said lorison trembling say what you please of me doubt it as you must i will yet prove my gratitude to you and my devotion to her but let me speak to her once now let me kneel for just one moment at her feet and tut tut said the priest how many acts of a love drama do you think an old bookworm like me capable of witnessing besides what kind of figures do we cut spying upon the mysteries of midnight millinery go to meet your wife to morrow as she ordered you and obey her thereafter and maybe some time i shall get forgive ness for the part i have played in this night s work off wid yez down the shtairs now tis late and an ould man like me should be takin his rest madame bo peep of the ranches aunt ellen said octavia cheerfully as she threw her black kid gloves carefully at the dignified persian cat on the window seat i m a pauper you are so extreme in your statements octavia dear said aunt ellen mildly looking up from her paper if you find yourself temporarily in need of some small change for bonbons you will find my purse in the drawer of the writing desk octavia beaupree removed her hat and seated herself on a footstool near her aunt s chair clasping her hands about her knees her slim and flexible figure clad in a modish mourning costume accommodated itself easily and gracefully to the trying position her bright and youthful face with its pair of sparkling life enamoured eyes tried to compose itself to the seriousness that the occasion seemed to demand you good auntie it isn t a case of bonbons it is abject staring unpicturesque poverty with ready made clothes gasolined gloves and probably one o clock dinners all waiting with the traditional wolf at the door i ve just come from my lawyer auntie and please ma am i ain t got nothink t all flowers lady buttonhole gentleman pencils sir three for five to help a poor widow do i do it nicely auntie or as a bread winner accomplishment were my lessons in elocution entirely wasted do be serious my dear said aunt ellen letting her paper fall to the floor long enough to tell me what you mean colonel beaupree s estate colonel beaupree s estate interrupted octavia emphasizing her words with appropriate dramatic ges tures is of spanish castellar architecture colonel beaupree s resources are wind colonel beaupree s stocks are water colonel beaupree s income is all in the statement lacks the legal technicalities to which i have been listening for an hour but that is what it means when translated octavia aunt ellen was now visibly possessed by consternation i can hardly believe it and it was the impression that he was worth a million and the de peysters themselves introduced him octavia rippled out a laugh and then became properly grave de mortuis nil auntie not even the rest of it the dear old colonel what a gold brick he was after all i paid for my bargain fairly i m all here am i not items eyes fingers toes youth old family unques tionable position in society as called for in the contract no wild cat stock here octavia picked up the morning paper from the floor but i m not going to squeal isn t that what they call it when you rail at fortune because you ve lost the game she turned the pages of the paper calmly stock market no use for that society s doings that s done here is my page the wish column a van dresser could not be said to want for anything of course chamber maids cooks canvassers stenographers dear said aunt ellen with a little tremor in her voice please do not talk in that way even if your affairs are in so unfortunate a condition there is my three thousand octavia sprang up lithely and deposited a smart kiss on the delicate cheek of the prim little elderly maid blessed auntie your three thousand is just sufficient to insure your hyson to be free from willow leaves and keep the persian in sterilized cream i know i d be welcome but i prefer to strike bottom like beelzebub rather than hang around like the peri listening to the music from the side entrance i m going to earn my own living there s nothing else to do i m a oh oh oh i had forgotten there s one thing saved from the wreck it s a corral no a ranch in let me see texas an asset dear old mr bannister called it how pleased he was to show me something he could describe as unencumbered i ve a description of it among those stupid papers he made me bring away with me from his office i ll try to find it octavia found her shopping bag and drew from it a long envelope filled with typewritten documents a ranch in texas sighed aunt ellen it sounds to me more like a liability than an asset those are the places where the centipedes are found and cowboys and fandangos the rancho de las sombras read octavia from a sheet of violently purple typewriting is situated one hundred and ten miles southeast of san antonio and thirty eight miles from its nearest railroad station nopal on the i and g n ranch consists of acres of well watered land with title conferred by state patents and twenty two sections or acres partly under yearly running lease and partly bought under state s twenty year purchase act eight thousand graded merino sheep with the necessary equipment of horses vehicles and general ranch paraphernalia ranch house built of brick with six rooms comfortably furnished according to the requirements of the climate all within a strong barbed wire fence the present ranch manager seems to be competent and reliable and is rapidly placing upon a paying basis a business that in other hands had been allowed to suffer from neglect and misconduct this property was secured by colonel beaupree in a deal with a western irrigation syndicate and the title to it seems to be perfect with careful management and the natural increase of land values it ought to be made the foundation for a comfortable fortune for its owner when octavia ceased reading aunt ellen uttered something as near a sniff as her breeding permitted the prospectus she said with uncompromising metropolitan suspicion doesn t mention the centipedes or the indians and you never did like mutton octavia i don t see what advantage you can derive from this desert but octavia was in a trance her eyes were steadily regarding something quite beyond their focus her lips were parted and her face was lighted by the kindling furor of the explorer the ardent stirring disquiet of the adventurer suddenly she clasped her hands together exultantly the problem solves itself auntie she cried i m going to that ranch i m going to live on it i m going to learn to like mutton and even concede the good qualities of centipedes at a respectful distance it s just what i need it s a new life that comes when my old one is just ending it s a release auntie it isn t a narrow ing think of the gallops over those leagues of prairies with the wind tugging at the roots of your hair the com ing close to the earth and learning over again the stories of the growing grass and the little wild flowers without names glorious is what it will be shall i be a shepherdess with a watteau hat and a crook to keep the bad wolves from the lambs or a typical western ranch girl with short hair like the pictures of her in the sunday papers i think the latter and they ll have my picture too with the wild cats i ve slain single handed hanging from my saddle horn from the four hundred to the flocks is the way they ll headline it and they ll print photographs of the old van dresser mansion and the church where i was married they won t have my picture but they ll get an artist to draw it i ll be wild and woolly and i ll grow my own wool octavia aunt ellen condensed into the one word all the protests she was unable to utter don t say a word auntie i m going i ll see the sky at night fit down on the world like a big butter dish cover and i ll make friends again with the stars that i haven t had a chat with since i was a wee child i wish to go i m tired of all this i m glad i haven t any money i could bless colonel beaupree for that ranch and forgive him for all his bubbles what if the life will be rough and lonely i i deserve it i shut my heart to everything except that miserable ambition i oh i wish to go away and forget forget octavia swerved suddenly to her knees laid her flushed face in her aunt s lap and shook with turbulent sobs aunt ellen bent over her and smoothed the coppery brown hair i didn t know she said gently i didn t know that who was it dear when mrs octavia beaupree n e van dresser stepped from the train at nopal her manner lost for the moment some of that easy certitude which had always marked her movements the town was of recent estab lishment and seemed to have been hastily constructed of undressed lumber and flapping canvas the element that had congregated about the station though not offensively demonstrative was clearly composed of citizens accustomed to and prepared for rude alarms octavia stood on the platform against the telegraph office and attempted to choose by intuition from the swaggering straggling string of loungers the manager of the rancho de las sombras who had been instructed by mr bannister to meet her there that tall serious looking elderly man in the blue flannel shirt and white tie she thought must be he but no he passed by removing his gaze from the lady as hers rested on him according to the southern custom the manager she thought with some impatience at being kept waiting should have no difficulty in selecting her young women wearing the most recent thing in ash coloured travelling suits were not so plentiful in nopal thus keeping a speculative watch on all persons of possible managerial aspect octavia with a catching breath and a start of surprise suddenly became aware of teddy westlake hurrying along the platform in the direction of the train of teddy westlake or his sun browned ghost in cheviot boots and leather girdled hat theodore westlake jr amateur polo almost champion all round butterfly and cumberer of the soil but a broader surer more emphasized and determined teddy than the one she had known a year ago when last she saw him he perceived octavia at almost the same time deflected his course and steered for her in his old straightforward way something like awe came upon her as the strange ness of his metamorphosis was brought into closer range the rich red brown of his complexion brought out so vividly his straw coloured mustache and steel gray eyes he seemed more grown up and somehow farther away but when he spoke the old boyish teddy came back again they had been friends from childhood why tave he exclaimed unable to reduce his perplexity to coherence how what when where train said octavia necessity ten minutes ago home your complexion s gone teddy now how what when where i m working down here said teddy he cast side glances about the station as one does who tries to combine politeness with duty you didn t notice on the train he asked an old lady with gray curls and a poodle who occupied two seats with her bundles and quarrelled with the conductor did you i think not answered octavia reflecting and you haven t by any chance noticed a big gray mustached man in a blue shirt and six shooters with little flakes of merino wool sticking in his hair have you lots of em said teddy with symptoms of mental delirium under the strain do you happen to know any such individual no the description is imaginary is your interest in the old lady whom you describe a personal one never saw her in my life she s painted entirely from fancy she owns the little piece of property where i earn my bread and butter the rancho de las sombras i drove up to meet her according to arrangement with her lawyer octavia leaned against the wall of the telegraph office was this possible and didn t he know are you the manager of that ranch she asked weakly i am said teddy with pride i am mrs beaupree said octavia faintly but my hair never would curl and i was polite to the conductor for a moment that strange grown up look came back and removed teddy miles away from her i hope you ll excuse me he said rather awkwardly you see i ve been down here in the chaparral a year i hadn t heard give me your checks please and i ll have your traps loaded into the wagon jos will follow with them we travel ahead in the buckboard seated by teddy in a feather weight buckboard behind a pair of wild cream coloured spanish ponies octavia abandoned all thought for the exhilaration of the present they swept out of the little town and down the level road toward the south soon the road dwindled and dis appeared and they struck across a world carpeted with an endless reach of curly mesquite grass the wheels made no sound the tireless ponies bounded ahead at an unbroken gallop the temperate wind made fragrant by thousands of acres of blue and yellow wild flowers roared gloriously in their ears the motion was a rial ecstatic with a thrilling sense of perpetuity in its effect octavia sat silent possessed by a feeling of elemental sensual bliss teddy seemed to be wrestling with some internal problem i m going to call you madama he announced as the result of his labours that is what the mexicans will call you they re nearly all mexicans on the ranch you know that seems to me about the proper thing very well mr westlake said octavia primly oh now said teddy in some consternation that s carrying the thing too far isn t it don t worry me with your beastly etiquette i m just beginning to live don t remind me of anything artificial if only this air could be bottled this much alone is worth coming for oh look i there goes a deer jack rabbit said teddy without turning his head could i might i drive suggested octavia pant ing with rose tinted cheeks and the eye of an eager child on one condition could i might i smoke forever cried octavia taking the lines with solemn joy how shall i know which way to drive keep her sou by sou east and all sail set you see that black speck on the horizon under that lowermost gulf cloud that s a group of live oaks and a land mark steer halfway between that and the little hill to the left i ll recite you the whole code of driving rules for the texas prairies keep the reins from under the horses feet and swear at em frequent i m too happy to swear ted oh why do people buy yachts or travel in palace cars when a buckboard and a pair of plugs and a spring morning like this can satisfy all desire now i ll ask you protested teddy who was futilely striking match after match on the dashboard not to call those denizens of the air plugs they can kick out a hundred miles between daylight and dark at last he succeeded in snatching a light for his cigar from the flame held in the hollow of his hands room said octavia intensely that s what produces the effect i know now what i ve wanted scope range room smoking room said teddy unsentimentally i love to smoke in a buckboard the wind blows the smoke into you and out again it saves exertion the two fell so naturally into their old time goodfellow ship that it was only by degrees that a sense of the strange ness of the new relations between them came to be felt madama said teddy wonderingly however did you get it into your bead to cut the crowd and come down here is it a fad now among the upper classes to trot off to sheep ranches instead of to newport i was broke teddy said octavia sweetly with her interest centred upon steering safely between a spanish dagger plant and a clump of chaparral i haven t a thing in the world but this ranch not even any other home to go to come now said teddy anxiously but ineredu lously you don t mean it when my husband said octavia with a shy slurring of the word died three months ago i thought i had a reasonable amount of the world s goods his lawyer exploded that theory in a sixty minute fully illustrated lecture i took to the sheep as a last resort do you happen to know of any fashionable caprice among the gilded youth of manhattan that induces them to abandon polo and club windows to become managers of sheep ranches it s easily explained in my case responded teddy promptly i had to go to work i couldn t have earned my board in new york so i chummed a while with old sandford one of the syndicate that owned the ranch before colonel beaupree bought it and got a place down here i wasn t manager at first i jogged around on ponies and studied the business in detail until i got all the points in my head i saw where it was losing and what the reme dies were and then sandford put me in charge i get a hundred dollars a month and i earn it poor teddy said octavia with a smile you needn t i like it i save half my wages and i m as hard as a water plug it beats polo will it furnish bread and tea and jam for another out cast from civilization the spring shearing said the manager just cleaned up a deficit in last year s business wastefulness and inattention have been the rule heretofore the autumn clip will leave a small profit over all expenses next year there will be jam when about four o clock in the afternoon the ponies rounded a gentle brush covered hill and then swooped like a double cream coloured cyclone upon the rancho de las sombras octavia gave a little cry of delight a lordly grove of magnificent live oaks cast an area of grateful cool shade whence the ranch had drawn its name de las sombras of the shadows the house of red brick one story ran low and long beneath the trees through its middle dividing its six rooms in half extended a broad arched passageway picturesque with flowering cactus and hanging red earthern jars a gallery low and broad encircled the building vines climbed about it and the adjacent ground was for a space covered with transplanted grass and shrubs a little lake long and narrow glimmered in the sun at the rear further away stood the shacks of the mexican workers the corrals wool sheds and shearing pens to the right lay the low hills splattered with dark patches of chaparral to the left the unbounded green prairie blending against the blue heavens it s a home teddy said octavia breathlessly that s what it is it s a home not so bad for a sheep ranch admitted teddy with excusable pride i ve been tinkering on it at odd times a mexican youth sprang from somewhere in the grass and took charge of the creams the mistress and the manager entered the house here s mrs macintyre said teddy as a placid neat elderly lady came out upon the gallery to meet them mrs mac here s the boss very likely she will be wanting a hunk of ham and a dish of beans after her drive mrs macintyre the housekeeper as much a fixture on the place as the lake or the live oaks received the imputation of the ranch s resources of refreshment with mild indignation and was about to give it utterance when octavia spoke oh mrs macintyre don t apologize for teddy yes i call him teddy so does every one whom he hasn t duped into taking him seriously you see we used to cut paper dolls and play jackstraws together ages ago no one minds what he says no said teddy no one minds what he says just so he doesn t do it again octavia cast one of those subtle sidelong glances toward him from beneath her lowered eyelids a glance that teddy used to describe as an upper cut but there was nothing in his ingenuous weather tanned face to warrant a suspicion that he was making an allusion nothing beyond a doubt thought octavia he had forgotten mr westlake likes his fun said mrs maclntyre as she conducted octavia to her rooms but she added loyally people around here usually pay attention to what he says when he talks in earnest i don t know what would have become of this place without him two rooms at the east end of the house had been arranged for the occupancy of the ranch s mistress when she entered them a slight dismay seized her at their bare appearance and the scantiness of their furniture but she quickly reflected that the climate was a semi tropical one and was moved to appreciation of the well conceived efforts to conform to it the sashes had already been removed from the big windows and white curtains waved in the gulf breeze that streamed through the wide jalousies the bare floor was amply strewn with cool rugs the chairs were inviting deep dreamy willows the walls were papered with a light cheerful olive one whole side of her sitting room was covered with books on smooth unpainted pine shelves she flew to these at once before her was a well selected library she caught glimpses of titles of volumes of fiction and travel not yet seasoned from the dampness of the press presently recollecting that she was now in a wilderness given over to mutton centipedes and privations the incongruity of these luxuries struck her and with intuitive feminine suspicion she began turning to the fly leaves of volume after volume upon each one was inscribed in fluent characters the name of theodore westlake jr octavia fatigued by her long journey retired early that night lying upon her white cool bed she rested deliciously but sleep coquetted long with her she listened to faint noises whose strangeness kept her faculties on the alert the fractious yelping of the coyotes the ceaseless low symphony of the wind the distant booming of the frogs about the lake the lamentation of a concertina in the mexicans quarters there were many conflicting feelings in her heart thankfulness and rebellion peace and disquietude loneliness and a sense of protecting care happiness and an old haunting pain she

six months would be up on the sixth of july well i showed em all the ice i had i raised the lid of a darkish vat and there was an elegant pound block of ice beautiful and convincing to the eye i was about to close down the lid again when one of those brunette sleuths flops down on his red knees and lays a slanderous and violent hand on my guarantee of good faith and in two minutes more they had dragged out on the floor that fine chunk of molded glass that had cost me fifty dollars to have shipped down from frisco ice y says the fellow that played me the dishonourable trick verree warm ice y yes the day is that hot senor yes maybeso it is of desirableness to leave him out to get the cool yes yes says i yes for i knew they had me touching s believing ain t it boys yes now there s some might say the seats of your trousers are sky blue but tis my opinion they are red let s apply the tests of the laying on of hands and feet and so i hoisted both those inspectors out the door on the toe of my shoe and sat down to cool off on my block of disreputable glass and as i live without oats while i sat there homesick for money and without a cent to my ambition there came on the breeze the most beautiful smell my nose had entered for a year god knows where it came from in that backyard of a country it was a bouquet of soaked lemon peel cigar stumps and stale beer exactly the smell of goldbrick charley s place on fourteenth street where i used to play pinochle of afternoons with the third rate actors and that smell drove my troubles through me and clinched em at the back i began to long for my country and feel sentiments about it and i said words about salvador that you wouldn t think could come legitimate out of an ice factory and while i was sitting there down through the blazing sunshine in his clean white clothes comes maximilian jones an american interested in rubber and rosewood great carrambos says i when he stepped in for i was in a bad temper didn t i have catastrophes enough i know what you want you want to tell me that story again about johnny ammiger and the widow on the train you ve told it nine times already this month it must be the heat says jones stopping in at the door amazed poor billy he s got bugs sitting on ice and calling his best friends pseudonyms hi muchacho jones called my force of employees who was sitting in the sun playing with his toes and told him to put on his trousers and run for the doctor come back says i sit down maxy and forget it tis not ice you see nor a lunatic upon it tis only an exile full of homesickness sitting on a lump of glass that s just cost him a thousand dollars now what was it johnny said to the widow first i d like to hear it again maxy honest don t mind what i said maximilian jones and i sat down and talked he was about as sick of the country as i was for the grafters were squeezing him for half the profits of his rosewood and rubber down in the bottom of a tank of water i had a dozen bottles of sticky frisco beer and i fished these up and we fell to talking about home and the flag and hail columbia and home fried potatoes and the drivel we contributed would have sickened any man enjoying those blessings but at that time we were out of em you can t appreciate home till you ve left it money till it s spent your wife till she s joined a woman s club nor old glory till you see it hanging on a broomstick on the shanty of a consul in a foreign town and sitting there me and maximilian jones scratching at our prickly heat and kicking at the lizards on the floor became afflicted with a dose of patriotism and affection for our country there was me billy casparis reduced from a capitalist to a pauper by over addiction to my glass in the lump declares my troubles off for the present and myself to be an uncrowned sovereign of the greatest country on earth and maximilian jones pours out whole drug stores of his wrath on oligarchies and potentates in red trousers and calico shoes and we issues a declaration of interference in which we guarantee that the fourth day of july shall be celebrated in salvador with all the kinds of salutes explosions honours of war oratory and liquids known to tradition yes neither me nor jones breathed with soul so dead there shall be rucuses in salvador we say and the monkeys had better climb the tallest cocoanut trees and the fire department get out its red sashes and two tin buckets about this time into the factory steps a native man incriminated by the name of general mary esperanza dingo he was some pumpkin both in politics and colour and the friend of me and jones he was full of politeness and a kind of intelligence having picked up the latter and managed to preserve the former during a two years residence in philadelphia studying medicine for a salvadorian he was not such a calamitous little man though he always would play jack queen king ace deuce for a straight general mary sits with us and has a bottle while he was in the states he had acquired a synopsis of the english language and the art of admiring our institutions by and by the general gets up and tiptoes

em they d sound exactly like one of george cohan s songs well you know how it runs on if you ve read any of em he slaps the king s swiss body guards around like everything whenever they get in his way he s a great fencer too now i ve known of some chicago men who were pretty notorious fences but i never heard of any fencers coming from there he stands on the first landing of the royal staircase in castle schutzenfestenstein with a gleaming rapier in his hand and makes a baltimore broil of six platoons of traitors who come to massacre the said king and then he has to fight duels with a couple of chancellors and foil a plot by four austrian archdukes to seize the kingdom for a gasoline station but the great scene is when his rival for the princess hand count feodor attacks him between the portcullis and the ruined chapel armed with a mitrailleuse a yataghan and a couple of siberian bloodhounds this scene is what runs the best seller into the twenty ninth edition before the publisher has had time to draw a check for the advance royalties the american hero shucks his coat and throws it over the heads of the bloodhounds gives the mitrailleuse a slap with his mitt says yah to the yataghan and lands in kid mccoy s best style on the count s left eye of course we have a neat little prize fight right then and there the count in order to make the go possible seems to be an expert at the art of self defence himself and here we have the corbett sullivan fight done over into literature the book ends with the broker and the princess doing a john cecil clay cover under the linden trees on the gorgonzola walk that winds up the love story plenty good enough but i notice that the book dodges the final issue even a best seller has sense enough to shy at either leaving a chicago grain broker on the throne of lobsterpotsdam or bringing over a real princess to eat fish and potato salad in an italian chalet on michigan avenue what do you think about em why said i i hardly know john there s a saying love levels all ranks you know yes said pescud but these kind of love stories are rank on the level i know something about literature even if i am in plate glass these kind of books are wrong and yet i never go into a train but what they pile em up on me no good can come out of an international clinch between the old world aristocracy and one of us fresh americans when people in real life marry they generally hunt up somebody in their own station a fellow usually picks out a girl that went to the same high school and belonged to the same singing society that he did when young millionaires fall in love they always select the chorus girl that likes the same kind of sauce on the lobster that he does washington newspaper correspondents always many widow ladies ten years older than themselves who keep boarding houses no sir you can t make a novel sound right to me when it makes one of c d gibson s bright young men go abroad and turn kingdoms upside down just because he s a taft american aud took a course at a gymnasium and listen how they talk too pescud picked up the best seller and hunted his page listen at this said he trevelyan is chinning with the princess alwyna at the back end of the tulip garden this is how it goes say not so dearest and sweetest of earth s fairest flowers would i aspire you are a star set high above me in a royal heaven i am only myself yet i am a man and i have a heart to do and dare i have no title save that of an uncrowned sovereign but i have an arm and a sword that yet might free schutzenfestenstein from the plots of traitors think of a chicago man packing a sword and talking about freeing anything that sounded as much like canned pork as that he d be much more likely to fight to have an import duty put on it i think i understand you john said i you want fiction writers to be consistent with their scenes and characters they shouldn t mix turkish pashas with vermont farmers or english dukes with long island clam diggers or italian countesses with montana cowboys or cincinnati brewery agents with the rajahs of india or plain business men with aristocracy high above em added pescud it don t jibe people are divided into classes whether we admit it or not and it s everybody s impulse to stick to their own class they do it too i don t see why people go to work and buy hundreds of thousands of books like that you don t see or hear of any such didoes and capers in real life iii well john said i i haven t read a best seller in a long time maybe i ve had notions about them somewhat like yours but tell me more about yourself getting along all right with the company bully said pescud brightening at once i ve had my salary raised twice since i saw you and i get a commission too i ve bought a neat slice of real estate out in the east end and have run up a house on it next year the firm is going to sell me some shares of stock oh i m in on the line of general prosperity no matter who s elected met your affinity yet john i asked oh i didn t tell you about that did i said pescud with a broader grin ho i said so you ve taken time enough off from your plate glass to have a romance no no said john no romance nothing like that but i ll tell you about it i was on the south bound going to cincinnati about eighteen months ago when i saw across the aisle the finest looking girl i d ever laid eyes on nothing spectacular you know but just the sort you want for keeps well i never was up to the flirtation business either handkerchief automobile postage stamp or door step and she wasn t the kind to start anything she read a book and minded her business which was to make the world prettier and better just by residing on it i kept on looking out of the side doors of my eyes and finally the proposition got out of the pullman class into a case of a cottage with a lawn and vines running over the porch i never thought of speaking to her but i let the plate glass business go to smash for a while she changed cars at cincinnati and took a sleeper to louisville over the l and n there she bought another ticket and went on through shelbyville frankfort and lexington along there i began to have a hard time keeping up with her the trains came along when they pleased and didn t seem to be going anywhere in particular except to keep on the track and the right of way as much as possible then they began to stop at junctions instead of towns and at last they stopped altogether i ll bet pinkerton would outbid the plate glass people for my services any time if they knew how i managed to shadow that young lady i contrived to keep out of her sight as much as i could but i never lost track of her the last station she got off at was away down in virginia about six in the afternoon there were about fifty houses and four hundred niggers in sight the rest was red mud mules and speckled hounds a tall old man with a smooth face and white hair looking as proud as julius caesar and roscoe conkling on the same post card was there to meet her his clothcs were frazzled but i didn t notice that till later he took her little satchel and they started over the plank walks and went up a road along the hill i kept along a piece behind em trying to look like i was hunting a garnet ring in the sand that my sister had lost at a picnic the previous saturday they went in a gate on top of the hill it nearly took my breath away when i looked up up there in the biggest grove i ever saw was a tremendous house with round white pillars about a thousand feet high and the yard was so full of rose bushes and box bushes and lilacs that you couldn t have seen the house if it hadn t been as big as the capitol at washington here s where i have to trail says i to myself i thought before that she seemed to be in moderate circumstances at least this must be the governor s mansion or the agricultural building of a new world s fair anyhow i d better go back to the village and get posted by the postmaster or drug the druggist for some information in the village i found a pine hotel called the bay view house the only excuse for the name was a bay horse grazing in the front yard i set my sample case down and tried to be ostensible i told the landlord i was taking orders for plate glass i don t want no plates says he but i do need another glass molasses pitcher by and by i got him down to local gossip and answering questions why says he i thought everybody knowed who lived in the big white house on the hill it s colonel allyn the biggest man and the finest quality in virginia or anywhere else they re the oldest family in the state that was his daughter that got off the train she s been up to illinois to see her aunt who is sick i registered at the hotel and on the third day i caught the young lady walking in the front yard down next to the paling fence i stopped and raised my hat there wasn t any other way excuse me says i can you tell me where mr hinkle lives she looks at me as cool as if i was the man come to see about the weeding of the garden but i thought i saw just a slight twinkle of fun in her eyes no one of that name lives in birchton says she that is she goes on as far as i know is the gentleman you are seeking white well that tickled me no kidding says i i m not looking for smoke even if i do come from pittsburgh you are quite a distance from home says she i d have gone a thousand miles farther says i not if you hadn t waked up when the train started in shelbyville says she and then she turned almost as red as one of the roses on the bushes in the yard i remembered i had dropped off to sleep on a bench in the shelbyville station waiting to see which train she took and only just managed to wake up in time and then i told her why i had come as respectful and earnest as i could and i told her everything about myself and what i was making and how that all i asked was just to get acquainted with her and try to get her to like me she smiles a little and blushes some but her eyes never get mixed up they look straight at whatever she s talking to i never had any one talk like this to me before mr pescud says she what did you say your name is john john a says i and you came mighty near missing the train at powhatan junction too says she with a laugh that sounded as good as a mileage book to me how did you know i asked men are very clumsy said she i knew you were on every train i thought you were going to speak to me and i m glad you didn t then we had more talk and at last a kind of proud serious look came on her face and she turned and pointed a finger at the big house the allyns says she have lived in elmcroft for a hundred years we are a proud family look at that mansion it has fifty rooms see the pillars and porches and balconies the ceilings in the reception rooms and the ball room are twenty eight feet high my father is a lineal descendant of belted earls i belted one of em once in the duquesne hotel in pittsburgh says i and he didn t offer to resent it he was there dividing his attentions between monongahela whiskey and heiresses and he got fresh of course she goes on my father wouldn t allow a drummer to set his foot in elmeroft if he knew that i was talking to one over the fence he would lock me in my room would you let me come there says i would you talk to me if i was to call for i goes on if you said i might come and see you the earls might be belted or suspendered or pinned up with safety pins as far as i am concerned i must not talk to you she says because we have not been introduced it is not exactly proper so i will say good bye mr say the name says i you haven t forgotten it pescud says she a little mad the rest of the name i demands cool as could be john says she john what i says john a says she with her head high are you through now i m coming to see the belted earl to morrow i says he ll feed you to his fox hounds says she laughing if he does it ll improve their running says i i m something of a hunter myself i must be going in now says she i oughtn t to have spoken to you at all i hope you ll have a pleasant trip back to minneapolis or pittsburgh was it good bye good night says i and it wasn t minneapolis what s your name first please she hesitated then she pulled a leaf off a bush and said my name is jessie says she good night miss allyn says i the next morning at eleven sharp i rang the door bell of that world s fair main building after about three quarters of an hour an old nigger man about eighty showed up and asked what i wanted i gave him my business card and said i wanted to see the colonel he showed me in say did you ever crack open a wormy english walnut that s what that house was like there wasn t enough furniture in it to fill an eight dollar flat some old horsehair lounges and three legged chairs and some framed ancestors on the walls were all that met the eye but when colonel allyn comes in the place seemed to light up you could almost hear a band playing and see a bunch of old timers in wigs and white stockings dancing a quadrille it was the style of him although he had on the same shabby clothes i saw him wear at the station for about nine seconds he had me rattled and i came mighty near getting cold feet and trying to sell him some plate glass but i got my nerve back pretty quick he asked me to sit down and i told him everything i told him how i followed his daughter from cincinnati and what i did it for and all about my salary and prospects and explained to him my little code of living to be always decent and right in your home town and when you re on the road never take more than four glasses of beer a day or play higher than a twenty five cent limit at first i thought he was going to throw me out of the window but i kept on talking pretty soon i got a chance to tell him that story about the western congressman who had lost his pocket book and the grass widow you remember that story well that got him to laughing and i ll bet that was the first laugh those ancestors and horsehair sofas had heard in many a day we talked two hours i told him everything i knew and then he began to ask questions and i told him the rest all i asked of him was to give me a chance if i couldn t make a hit with the little lady i d clear out and not bother any more at last he says there was a sir courtenay pescud in the time of charles i if i remember rightly if there was says i he can t claim kin with our bunch we ve always lived in and around pittsburgh i ve got an uncle in the real estate business and one in trouble somewhere out in kansas you can inquire about any of the rest of us from anybody in old smoky town and get satisfactory replies did you ever run across that story about the captain of the whaler who tried to make a sailor say his prayers says i it occurs to me that i have never been so fortunate says the colonel so i told it to him laugh i was wishing to myself that he was a customer what a bill of glass i d sell him and then he says the relating of anecdotes and humorous occurrences has always seemed to me mr pescud to be a particularly agreeable way of promoting and perpetuating amenities between friends with your permission i will relate to you a fox hunting story with which i was personally connected and which may furnish you some amusement so he tells it it takes forty minutes by the watch did i laugh well say when i got my face straight he calls in old pete the super annuated darky and sends him down to the hotel to bring up my valise it was elmcroft for me while i was in the town two evenings later i got a chance to speak a word with miss jessie alone on the porch while the colonel was thinking up another story it s going to be a fine evening says i he s coming says she he s going to tell you this time the story about the old negro and the green watermelons it always comes after the one about the yankees and the game rooster there was another time she goes on that you nearly got left it was at pulaski city yes says i i remember my foot slipped as i was jumping on the step and i nearly tumbled off i know says she and and i i was afraid you had john a i was afraid you had and then she skips into the house through one of the big windows iv coketown droned the porter making his way through the slowing car pescud gathered his hat and baggage with the leisurely promptness of an old traveller i married her a year ago said john i told you i built a house in the east end the belted i mean the colonel is there too i find him waiting at the gate whenever i get back from a trip to hear any new story i might have picked up on the road i glanced out of the window coketown was nothing more than a ragged hillside dotted with a score of black dismal huts propped up against dreary mounds of slag and clinkers it rained in slanting torrents too and the rills foamed and splashed down through the black mud to the railroad tracks you won t sell much plate glass here john said i why do you get off at this end o the world why said pescud the other day i took jessie for a little trip to philadelphia and coming back she thought she saw some petunias in a pot in one of those windows over there just like some she used to raise down in the old virginia home so i thought i d drop off here for the night and see if i could dig up some of the cuttings or blossoms for her here we are good night old man i gave you the address come out and see us when you have time the train moved forward one of the dotted brown ladies insisted on having windows raised now that the rain beat against them the porter came along with his mysterious wand and began to light the car i glanced downward and saw the best seller i picked it up and set it carefully farther along on the floor of the car where the rain drops would not fall upon it and then suddenly i smiled and seemed to see that life has no geographical metes and bounds good luck to you trevelyan i said and may you get the petunias for your princess rus in urbe considering men in relation to money there are three kinds whom i dislike men who have more money than they can spend men who have more money than they do spend and men who spend more money than they have of the three varieties i believe i have the least liking for the first but as a man i liked spencer grenville north pretty well although he had something like two or ten or thirty millions i ve forgotten exactly how many i did not leave town that summer i usually went down to a village on the south shore of long island the place was surrounded by duck farms and the ducks and dogs and whippoorwills and rusty windmills made so much noise that i could sleep as peacefully as if i were in my own flat six doors from the elevated railroad in new york but that summer i did not go remember that one of my friends asked me why i did not i replied because old man new york is the finest summer resort in the world you have heard that phrase before but that is what i told him i was press agent that year for binkly bing the theatrical managers and producers of course you know what a press agent is well he is not that is the secret of being one binkly was touring france in his new c n williamson car and bing had gone to scotland to learn curling which he seemed to associate in his mind with hot tongs rather than with ice before they left they gave me june and july on salary for my vacation which act was in accord with their large spirit of liberality but i remained in new york which i had decided was the finest summer resort in but i said that before on july the th north came to town from his camp in the adirondacks try to imagine a camp with sixteen rooms plumbing eiderdown quilts a butler a garage solid silver plate and a long distance telephone of course it was in the woods if mr pinchot wants to preserve the forests let him give every citizen two or ten or thirty million dollars and the trees will all gather around the summer camps as the birnam woods came to dunsinane and be preserved north came to see me in my three rooms and bath extra charge for light when used extravagantly or all night he slapped me on the back i would rather have my shins kicked any day and greeted me with out door obstreperousness and revolting good spirits he was insolently brown and healthy looking and offensively well dressed just ran down for a few days said he to sign some papers and stuff like that my lawyer wired me to come well you indolent cockney what are you doing in town i took a chance and telephoned and they said you were here what s the matter with that utopia on long island where you used to take your typewriter and your villanous temper every summer anything wrong with the er swans weren t they that used to sing on the farms at night ducks said i the songs of swans are for luckier ears they swim and curve their necks in artificial lakes on the estates of the wealthy to delight the eyes of the favorites of fortune also in central park said north to delight the eyes of immigrants and bummers i ve seen em there lots of times but why are you in the city so late in the summer new york city i began to recite is the finest sum no you don t said north emphatically you don t spring that old one on me i know you know better man you ought to have gone up with us this summer the prestons are there and tom volney and the monroes and lulu stanford and the miss kennedy and her aunt that you liked so well i never liked miss kennedy s aunt i said i didn t say you did said north we are having the greatest time we ve ever had the pickerel and trout are so ravenous that i believe they would swallow your hook with a montana copper mine prospectus fastened on it and we ve a couple of electric launches and i ll tell you what we do every night or two we tow a rowboat behind each one with a big phonograph and a boy to change the discs in em on the water and twenty yards behind you they are not so bad and there are passably good roads through the woods where we go motoring i shipped two cars up there and the pinecliff inn is only three miles away you know the pinecliff some good people are there this season and we run over to the dances twice a week can t you go back with me for a week old man i laughed northy said i if i may be so familiar with a millionaire because i hate both the names spencer and grenville your invitation is meant kindly but the city in the summer time for me here while the bourgeoisie is away i can live as nero lived barring thank heaven the fiddling while the city burns at ninety in the shade the tropics and the zones wait upon me like handmaidens i sit under florida palms and eat pomegranates while boreas himself electrically conjured up blows upon me his arctic breath as for trout you know yourself that jean at maurice s cooks them better than any one else in the world be advised said north my chef has pinched the blue ribbon from the lot he lays some slices of bacon inside the trout wraps it all in corn husks the husks of green corn you know buries them in hot ashes and covers them with live coals we build fires on the bank of the lake and have fish suppers i know said i and the servants bring down tables and chairs and damask cloths and you eat with silver forks i know the kind of camps that you millionaires have and therc are champagne pails set about disgracing the wild flowers and no doubt madame tetrazzini to sing in the boat pavilion after the trout oh no said north concernedly we were never as bad as that we did have a variety troupe up from the city three or four nights but they weren t stars by as far as light can travel in the same length of time i always like a few home comforts even when i m roughing it but don t tell me you prefer to stay in the city during summer i don t believe it if you do why did you spend your summers there for the last four years even sneaking away from town on a night train and refusing to tell your friends where this arcadian village was because said i they might have followed me and discovered it but since then i have learned that amaryllis has come to town the coolest things the freshest the brightest the choicest are to be found in the city if you ve nothing on hand this evening i will show you i m free said north and i have my light car outside i suppose since you ve been converted to the town that your idea of rural sport is to have a little whirl between bicycle cops in central park and then a mug of sticky ale in some stuffy rathskeller under a fan that can t stir up as many revolutions in a week as nicaragua can in a day we ll begin with the spin through the park anyhow i said i was choking with the hot stale air of my little apartment and i wanted that breath of the cool to brace me for the task of proving to my friend that new york was the greatest and so forth where can you find air any fresher or purer than this i asked as we sped into central s boskiest dell air said north contemptuously do you call this air this muggy vapor smelling of garbage and gasoline smoke man i wish you could get one sniff of the real adirondack article in the pine woods at daylight i have heard of it said i but for fragrance and tang and a joy in the nostrils i would not give one puff of sea breeze across the bay down on my little boat dock on long island for ten of your turpentine scented tornadoes then why asked north a little curiously don t you go there instead of staying cooped up in this greater bakery because said i doggedly i have discovered that new york is the greatest summer don t say that again interrupted north unless you ve actually got a job as general passenger agent of the subway you can t really believe it i went to some trouble to try to prove my theory to my friend the weather bureau and the season had conspired to make the argument worthy of an able advocate the city seemed stretched on a broiler directly above the furnaces of avernus there was a kind of tepid gayety afoot and awheel in the boulevards mainly evinced by languid men strolling about in straw hats and evening clothes and rows of idle taxicabs with their flags up looking like a blockaded fourth of july procession the hotels kept up a specious brilliancy and hospitable outlook but inside one saw vast empty caverns and the footrails at the bars gleamed brightly from long disacquaintance with the sole leather of customers in the cross town streets the steps of the old brownstone houses were swarming with stoopers that motley race hailing from sky light room and basement bringing out their straw doorstep mats to sit and fill the air with strange noises and opinions north and i dined on the top of a hotel and here for a few minutes i thought i had made a score an east wind almost cool blew across the roofless roof a capable orchestra concealed in a bower of wistaria played with sufficient judgment to make the art of music probable and the art of conversation possible some ladies in reproachless summer gowns at other tables gave animation and color to the scene and an excellent dinner mainly from the refrigerator seemed to successfully back my judgment as to summer resorts but north grumbled all during the meal and cursed his lawyers and prated so of his confounded camp in the woods that i began to wish he would go back there and leave me in my peaceful city retreat after dining we went to a roof garden vaudeville that was being much praised there we found a good bill an artificially cooled atmosphere cold drinks prompt service and a gay well dressed audience north was bored if this isn t comfortable enough for you on the hottest august night for five years i said a little sarcastically you might think about the kids down in delancey and hester streets lying out on the fire escapes with their tongues hanging out trying to get a breath of air that hasn t been fried on both sides the contrast might increase your enjoyment don t talk socialism said north i gave five hundred dollars to the free ice fund on the first of may i m contrasting these stale artificial hollow wearisome amusements with the enjoyment a man can get in the woods you should see the firs and pines do skirt dances during a storm and lie down flat and drink out of a mountain branch at the end of a day s tramp after the deer that s the only way to spend a summer get out and live with nature i agree with you absolutely said i with emphasis for one moment i had relaxed my vigilance and had spoken my true sentiments north looked at me long and curiously then why in the name of pan and apollo he asked have you been singing this deceitful paean to summer in town i suppose i looked my guilt ha said north i see may i ask her name annie ashton said i simply she played nannette in binkley bing s production of the silver cord she is to have a better part next season take me to see her said north miss ashton lived with her mother in a small hotel they were out of the west and had a little money that bridged the seasons as press agent of binkley bing i had tried to keep her before the public as robert james vandiver i had hoped to withdraw her for if ever one was made to keep company with said vandiver and smell the salt breeze on the south shore of long island and listen to the ducks quack in the watches of the night it was the ashton set forth above but she had a soul above ducks above nightingales aye even above birds of paradise she was very beautiful with quiet ways and seemed genuine she had both taste and talent for the stage and she liked to stay at home and read and make caps for her mother she was unvaryingly kind and friendly with binkley bing s press agent since the theatre had closed she had allowed mr vandiver to call in an unofficial role i had often spoken to her of my friend spencer grenville north and so as it was early the first turn of the vaudeville being not yet over we left to find a telephone miss ashton would be very glad to see mr vandiver and mr north we found her fitting a new cap on her mother i never saw her look more charming north made himself disagreeably entertaining he was a good talker and had a way with him besides he had two ten or thirty millions i ve for gotten which i incautiously admired the mother s cap whereupon she brought out her store of a dozen or two and i took a course in edgings and frills even though annie s fingers had pinked or ruched or hemmed or whatever you do to em they palled upon me and i could hear north drivelling to annie about his odious adirondack camp two days after that i saw north in his motor car with miss ashton and her mother on the next afternoon he dropped in on me bobby said he this old burg isn t such a bad proposition in the summer time after all since i ve keen knocking around it looks better to me there are some first rate musical comedies and light operas on the roofs and in the outdoor gardens and if you hunt up the right places and stick to soft drinks you can keep about as cool here as you can in the country hang it when you come to think of it there s nothing much to the country anyhow you get tired and sunburned and lonesome and you have to eat any old thing that the cook dishes up to you it makes a difference doesn t it said i it certainly does now i found some whitebait yesterday at maurice s with a new sauce that beats anything in the trout line i ever tasted it makes a difference doesn t it i said immense the sauce is the main thing with whitebait it makes a difference doesn t it i asked looking him straight in the eye he understood look here bob he said i was going to tell you i couldn t help it i ll play fair with you but i m going in to win she is the one particular for me all right said i it s a fair field there are no rights for you to encroach upon on thursday afternoon miss ashton invited north and myself to have tea in her apartment he was devoted and she was more charming than usual by avoiding the subject of caps i managed to get a word or two into and out of the talk miss ashton asked me in a make conversational tone something about the next season s tour oh said i i don t know about that i m not going to be with binkley bing next season why i thought said she that they were going to put the number one road company under your charge i thought you told me so they were said i but they won t i ll tell you what i m going to do i m going to the south shore of long island and buy a small cottage i know there on the edge of the bay and i ll buy a catboat and a rowboat and a shotgun and a yellow dog i ve got money enough to do it and i ll smell the salt wind all day when it blows from the sea and the pine odor when it blows from the land and of course i ll write plays until i have a trunk full of em on hand and the next thing and the biggest thing i ll do will be to buy that duck farm next door few people understand ducks i can watch em for hours they can march better than any company in the national guard and they can play follow my leader better than the entire democratic party their voices don t amount to much but i like to hear em they wake you up a dozen times a night but there s a homely sound about their quacking that is more musical to me than the cry of fresh strawber rees under your window in the morning when you want to sleep and i went on enthusiastically do you know the value of ducks besides their beauty and intelligence and order and sweetness of voice picking their feathers gives you an unfailing and never ceasing income on a farm that i know the feathers were sold for in one year think of that and the ones shipped to the market will bring in more money than that yes i am for the ducks and the salt breeze coming over the bay i think i shall get a chinaman cook and with him and the dog and the sunsets for company i shall do well no more of this dull baking senseless roaring city for me miss ashton looked surprised north laughed i am going to begin one of my plays tonight i said so i must be going and with that i took my departure a few days later miss ashton telephoned to me asking me to call at four in the afternoon i did you have been very good to me she said hesitatingly and i thought i would tell you i am going to leave the stage yes said i i suppose you will they usually do when there s so much money there is no money she said or very little our money is almost gone but i am told said i that he has something like two or ten or thirty millions i have forgotten which i know what you mean she said i will not pretend that i do not i am not going to marry mr north then why are you leaving the stage i asked severely what else can you do to earn a living she came closer to me and i can see the look in her eyes yet as she spoke i can pick ducks she said we sold the first year s feathers for a poor rule i have always maintained and asserted ime to time that woman is no mystery that man can foretell construe subdue comprehend and interpret her that she is a mystery has been foisted by herself upon credulous mankind whether i am right or wrong we shall see as harper s drawer used to say in bygone years the following good story is told of miss mr mr and mr we shall have to omit bishop x and the rev for they do not belong in those days paloma was a new town on the line of the southern pacific a reporter would have called it a mushroom town but it was not paloma was first and last of the toadstool variety the train stopped there at noon for the engine to drink and for the passengers both to drink and to dine there was a new yellow pine hotel also a wool warehouse and perhaps three dozen box residences the rest was composed of tents cow ponies black waxy mud and mesquite trees all bound round by a horizon paloma was an about to be city the houses represented faith the tents hope the twice a day train by which you might leave creditably sustained the role of charity the parisian restaurant occupied the muddiest spot in the town while it rained and the warmest when it shone it was operated owned and perpetrated by a citizen known as old man hinkle who had come out of indiana to make his fortune in this land of condensed milk and sorghum there was a four room unpainted weather boarded box house in which the family lived from the kitchen extended a shelter made of poles covered with chaparral brush under this was a table and two benches each twenty feet long the product of paloma home carpentry here was set forth the roast mutton the stewed apples boiled beans soda biscuits puddinorpie and hot coffee of the parisian menu ma hinkle and a subordinate known to the ears as betty but denied to the eyesight presided at the range pa hinkle himself with salamandrous thumbs served the scalding viands during rush hours a mexican youth who rolled and smoked cigarettes between courses aided him in waiting on the guests as is customary at parisian banquets i place the sweets at the end of my wordy menu ileen hinkle the spelling is correct for i have seen her write it no doubt she had been named by ear but she so splendidly bore the orthography that tom moore himself had he seen her would have indorsed the phonography ileen was the daughter of the house and the first lady cashier to invade the territory south of an east and west line drawn through galveston and del rio she sat on a high stool in a rough pine grand stand or was it a temple under the shelter at the door of the kitchen there was a barbed wire protection in front of her with a little arch under which you passed your money heaven knows why the barbed wire for every man who dined parisianly there would have died in her service her duties were light each meal was a dollar you put it under the arch and she took it i set out with the intent to describe ileen hinkle to you instead i must refer you to the volume by edmund burke entitled a philosophical inquiry into the origin of our ideas of the sublime and beautiful it is an exhaustive treatise dealing first with the primitive conceptions of beauty roundness and smoothness i think they are according to burke it is well said rotundity is a patent charm as for smoothness the more new wrinkles a woman acquires the smoother she becomes ileen was a strictly vegetable compound guaranteed under the pure ambrosia and balm of gilead act of the year of the fall of adam she was a fruit stand blonde strawberries peaches cherries etc her eyes were wide apart and she possessed the calm that precedes a storm that never comes but it seems to me that words at any rate per are wasted in an effort to describe the beautiful like fancy it is engendered in the eyes there are three kinds of beauties i was foreordained to be homiletic i can never stick to a story the first is the freckle faced snub nosed girl whom you like the second is maud adams the third is or are the ladies in bouguereau s paintings ileen hinkle was the fourth she was the mayoress of spotless town there were a thousand golden apples coming to her as helen of the troy laundries the parisian restaurant was within a radius even from beyond its circumference men rode in to paloma to win her smiles they got them one meal one smile one dollar but with all her impartiality ileen seemed to favor three of her admirers above the rest according to the rules of politeness i will mention myself last the first was an artificial product known as bryan jacks a name that had obviously met with reverses jacks was the outcome of paved cities he was a small man made of some material resembling flexible sandstone his hair was the color of a brick quaker meeting house his eyes were twin cranberries his mouth was like the aperture under a drop letters here sign he knew every city from bangor to san francisco thence north to portland thence s e to a given point in florida he had mastered every art trade game business profession and sport in the world had been present at or hurrying on his way to every head line event that had ever occurred between oceans since he was five years old you might open the atlas place your finger at random upon the name of a town and jacks would tell you the front names of three prominent citizens before you could close it again he spoke patronizingly and even disrespectfully of broadway beacon hill michigan euclid and fifth avenues and the st louis four courts compared with him as a cosmopolite the wandering jew would have seemed a mere hermit he had learned everything the world could teach him and he would tell you about it i hate to be reminded of pollock s course of time and so do you but every time i saw jacks i would think of the poet s description of another poet by the name of g g byron who drank early deeply drank drank draughts that common millions might have quenched then died of thirst because there was no more to drink that fitted jacks except that instead of dying he came to paloma which was about the same thing he was a telegrapher and station and express agent at seventy five dollars a month why a young man who knew everything and could do everything was content to serve in such an obscure capacity i never could understand although he let out a hint once that it was as a personal favor to the president and stockholders of the s p ry co one more line of description and i turn jacks over to you he wore bright blue clothes yellow shoes and a bow tie made of the same cloth as his shirt my rival no was bud cunningham whose services had been engaged by a ranch near paloma to assist in compelling refractory cattle to keep within the bounds of decorum and order bud was the only cowboy off the stage that i ever saw who looked like one on it he wore the sombrero the chaps and the handkerchief tied at the back of his neck twice a week bud rode in from the val verde ranch to sup at the parisian restaurant he rode a many high handed kentucky horse at a tremendously fast lope which animal he would rein up so suddenly under the big mesquite at the corner of the brush shelter that his hoofs would plough canals yards long in the loam jacks and i were regular boarders at the restaurant of course the front room of the hinkle house was as neat a little parlor as there was in the black waxy country it was all willow rocking chairs and home knit tidies and albums and conch shells in a row and a little upright piano in one comer here jacks and bud and i or sometimes one or two of us according to our good luck used to sit of evenings when the tide of trade was over and visit miss hinkle ileen was a girl of ideas she was destined for higher things if there can be anything higher than taking in dollars all day through a barbed wire wicket she had read and listened and thought her looks would have formed a career for a less ambitious girl but rising superior to mere beauty she must establish something in the nature of a salon the only one in paloma don t you think that shakespeare was a great writer she would ask with such a pretty little knit of her arched brows that the late ignatius donnelly himself had he seen it could scarcely have saved his bacon ileen was of the opinion also that boston is more cultured than chicago that rosa bonheur was one of the greatest of women painters that westerners are more spontaneous and open hearted than easterners that london must be a very foggy city and that california must be quite lovely in the springtime and of many other opinions indicating a keeping up with the world s best thought these however were but gleaned from hearsay and evidence ileen had theories of her own one in particular she disseminated to us untiringly flattery she detested frankness and honesty of speech and action she declared were the chief mental ornaments of man and woman if ever she could like any one it would be for those qualities i m awfully weary she said one evening when we three musketeers of the mesquite were in the little parlor of having compliments on my looks paid to me i know i m not beautiful bud cunningham told me afterward that it was all he could do to keep from calling her a liar when she said that i m only a little middle western girl went on ileen who justs wants to be simple and neat and tries to help her father make a humble living old man hinkle was shipping a thousand silver dollars a month clear profit to a bank in san antonio bud twisted around in his chair and bent the rim of his hat from which he could never be persuaded to separate he did not know whether she wanted what she said she wanted or what she knew she deserved many a wiser man has hesitated at deciding bud decided why ah miss ileen beauty as you might say ain t everything not sayin that you haven t your share of good looks i always admired more than anything else about you the nice kind way you treat your ma and pa any one what s good to their parents and is a kind of home body don t specially need to be too pretty ileen gave him one of her sweetest smiles thank you mr cunningham she said i consider that one of the finest compliments i ve had in a long time i d so much rather hear you say that than to hear you talk about my eyes and hair i m glad you believe me when i say i don t like flattery our cue was there for us bud had made a good guess you couldn t lose jacks he chimed in next sure thing miss ileen he said the good lookers don t always win out now you ain t bad looking of course but that s nix cum rous i knew a girl once in dubuque with a face like a cocoanut who could skin the cat twice on a horizontal bar without changing hands now a girl might have the california peach crop mashed to a marmalade and not be able to do that i ve seen er worse lookers than you miss ileen but what i like about you is the business way you ve got of doing things cool and wise that s the winning way for a girl mr hinkle told me the other day you d never taken in a lead silver dollar or a plugged one since you ve been on the job now that s the stuff for a girl that s what catches me jacks got his smile too thank you mr jacks said ileen if you only knew how i appreciate any one s being candid and not a flatterer i get so tired of people telling me i m pretty i think it is the loveliest thing to have friends who tell you the truth then i thought i saw an expectant look on ileen s face as she glanced toward me i had a wild sudden impulse to dare fate and tell her of all the beautiful handiwork of the great artificer she was the most exquisite that she was a flawless pearl gleaming pure and serene in a setting of black mud and emerald prairies that she was a a corker and as for mine i cared not if she were as crtiel as a serpent s tooth to her fond parents or if she couldn t tell a plugged dollar from a bridle buckle if i might sing chant praise glorify and worship her peerless and wonderful beauty but i refrained i feared the fate of a flatterer i had witnessed her delight at the crafty and discreet words of bud and jacks no miss hinkle was not one to be beguiled by the plated silver tongue of a flatterer so i joined the ranks of the candid and honest at once i became mendacious and didactic in all ages miss hinkle said i in spite of the poetry and romance of each intellect in woman has been admired more than beauty even in cleopatra herself men found more charm in her queenly mind than in her looks well i should think so said ileen i ve seen pictures of her that weren t so much she had an awfully long nose if i may say so i went on you remind me of cleopatra miss ileen why my nose isn t so long said she opening her eyes wide and touching that comely feature with a dimpled forefinger why er i mean said i i mean as to mental endowments oh said she and then i got my smile just as bud and jacks had got theirs thank every one of you she said very very sweetly for being so frank and honest with me that s the way i want you to be always just tell me plainly and truthfully what you think and we ll all be the best friends in the world and now because you ve been so good to me and understand so well how i dislike people who do nothing but pay me exaggerated compliments i ll sing and play a little for you of course we expressed our thanks and joy but we would have been better pleased if ileen had remained in her low rocking chair face to face with us and let us gaze upon her for she was no adelina patti not even on the fare wellest of the diva s farewell tours she had a cooing little voice like that of a turtle dove that could almost fill the parlor when the windows and doors were closed and betty was not rattling the lids of the stove in the kitchen she had a gamut that i estimate at about eight inches on the piano and her runs and trills sounded like the clothes bubbling in your grandmother s iron wash pot believe that she must have been beautiful when i tell you that it sounded like music to us she must have been beautiful when i tell you that it sounded like music to us ileen s musical taste was catholic she would sing through a pile of sheet music on the left hand top of the piano laying each slaughtered composition on the right hand top the next evening she would sing from right to left her favorites were mendelssohn and moody and sankey by request she always wound up with sweet violets and when the leaves begin to turn when we left at ten o clock the three of us would go down to jacks little wooden station and sit on the platform swinging our feet and trying to pump one another for dews as to which way miss ileen s inclinations seemed to lean that is the way of rivals they do not avoid and glower at one another they convene and converse and construe striving by the art politic to estimate the strength of the enemy one day there came a dark horse to paloma a young lawyer who at once flaunted his shingle and himself spectacularly upon the town his name was c vincent vesey you could see at a glance that he was a recent graduate of a southwestern law school his prince albert coat light striped trousers broad brimmed soft black hat and narrow white muslin bow tie proclaimed that more loudly than any diploma could vesey was a compound of daniel webster lord chesterfield beau brummell and little jack horner his coming boomed paloma the next day after he arrived an addition to the town was surveyed and laid off in lots of course vesey to further his professional fortunes must mingle with the citizenry and outliers of paloma and as well as with the soldier men he was bound to seek popularity with the

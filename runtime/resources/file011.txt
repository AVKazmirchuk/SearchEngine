in the east me and idaho moved camp into an old empty cabin higher up the mountain thinking it was only a november flurry but after falling three foot on a level it went to work in earnest and we knew we was snowed in we got in plenty of firewood before it got deep and we had grub enough for two months so we let the elements rage and cut up all they thought proper if you want to instigate the art of manslaughter just shut two men up in a eighteen by twenty foot cabin for a month human nature won t stand it when the first snowflakes fell me and idaho green laughed at each other s jokes and praised the stuff we turned out of a skillet and called bread at the end of three weeks idaho makes this kind of a edict to me says he i never exactly heard sour milk dropping out of a balloon on the bottom of a tin pan but i have an idea it would be music of the spears compared to this attenuated stream of asphyxiated thought that emanates out of your organs of conversation the kind of half masticated noises that you emit every day puts me in mind of a cow s cud only she s lady enough to keep hers to herself and you ain t mr green says i you having been a friend of mine once i have some hesitations in confessing to you that if i had my choice for society between you and a common yellow three legged cur pup one of the inmates of this here cabin would be wagging a tail just at present this way we goes on for two or three days and then we quits speaking to one another we divides up the cooking implements and idaho cooks his grub on one side of the fireplace and me on the other the snow is up to the windows and we have to keep a fire all day you see me and idaho never had any education beyond reading and doing if john had three apples and james five on a slate we never felt any special need for a university degree though we had acquired a species of intrinsic intelligence in knocking around the world that we could use in emergencies but snowbound in that cabin in the bitter roots we felt for the first time that if we had studied homer or greek and fractions and the higher branches of information we d have had some resources in the line of meditation and private thought i ve seen them eastern college fellows working in camps all through the west and i never noticed but what education was less of a drawback to em than you would think why once over on snake river when andrew mcwilliams saddle horse got the botts he sent a buckboard ten miles for one of these strangers that claimed to be a botanist but that horse died one morning idaho was poking around with a stick on top of a little shelf that was too high to reach two books fell down to the floor i started toward em but caught idaho s eye he speaks for the first time in a week don t burn your fingers says he in spite of the fact that you re only fit to be the companion of a sleeping mud turtle i ll give you a square deal and that s more than your parents did when they turned you loose in the world with the sociability of a rattle snake and the bedside manner of a frozen turnip i ll play you a game of seven up the winner to pick up his choice of the book the loser to take the other we played and idaho won he picked up his book and i took mine then each of us got on his side of the house and went to reading i never was as glad to see a ten ounce nugget as i was that book and idaho took at his like a kid looks at a stick of candy mine was a little book about five by six inches called herkimer s handbook of indispensable information i may be wrong but i think that was the greatest book that ever was written i ve got it to day and i can stump you or any man fifty times in five minutes with the information in it talk about solomon or the new york tribune herkimer had cases on both of em that man must have put in fifty years and travelled a million miles to find out all that stuff there was the population of all cities in it and the way to tell a girl s age and the number of teeth a camel has it told you the longest tunnel in the world the number of the stars how long it takes for chicken pox to break out what a lady s neck ought to measure the veto powers of governors the dates of the roman aqueducts how many pounds of rice going without three beers a day would buy the average annual temperature of augusta maine the quantity of seed required to plant an acre of carrots in drills antidotes for poisons the number of hairs on a blond lady s head how to preserve eggs the height of all the mountains in the world and the dates of all wars and battles and how to restore drowned persons and sunstroke and the number of tacks in a pound and how to make dynamite and flowers and beds and what to do before the doctor comes and a hundred times as many things besides if there was anything herkimer didn t know i didn t miss it out of the book i sat and read that book for four hours all the wonders of education

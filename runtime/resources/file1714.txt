there were others to be provided for but that does not excuse me i just wanted to see you and ask your forgiveness you have lived here ten years they tell me cherishing my memory i was blind hampton i could not see then that all the money in the world cannot weigh in the scales against a faithful heart if but it is too late now of course her assertion was a question clothed as best it could be in a loving woman s pride but through the thin disguise the hermit saw easily that his lady had come back to him if he chose he had won a golden crown if it pleased him to take it the reward of his decade of faithfulness was ready for his hand if he desired to stretch it forth for the space of one minute the old enchantment shone upon him with a reflected radiance and then by turns he felt the manly sensations of indignation at having been discarded and of repugnance at having been as it were sought again and last of all how strange that it should have come at last the pale blue vision of the beautifulest of the trenholme sisters illuminated his mind s eye and left him without a waver it is too late he said in deep tones pressing the baking powder can against his heart once she turned after she had gone slowly twenty yards down the path the hermit had begun to twist the lid off his can but he hid it again under his sacking robe he could see her great eyes shining sadly through the twilight but he stood inflexible in the doorway of his shack and made no sign just as the moon rose on thursday evening the hermit was seized by the world madness up from the inn fainter than the horns of elf land came now and then a few bars of music played by the casino band the hudson was broadened by the night into an illimitable sea those lights dimly seen on its opposite shore were not beacons for prosaic trolley lines but low set stars millions of miles away the waters in front of the inn were gay with fireflies or were they motor boats smelling of gasoline and oil once the hermit had known these things and had sported with amaryllis in the shade of the red and white striped awnings but for ten years he had turned a heedless ear to these far off echoes of a frivolous world but to night there was something wrong the casino band was playing a waltz a waltz what a fool he had been to tear deliberately ten years of his life from the calendar of existence for one who had given him up for the false joys that wealth tum ti tum ti tum ti how did that waltz go but those years had not been sacrificed had they not brought him the star and pearl of all the world the youngest and beautifulest of but do not come on thursday evening she had insisted perhaps by now she would be moving slowly and gracefully to the strains of that waltz held closely by west pointers or city commuters while he who had read in her eyes things that had recompensed him for ten lost years of life moped like some wild animal in its mountain den why should damn it said the hermit suddenly i ll do it he threw down his marcus aurelius and threw off his gunny sack toga he dragged a dust covered trunk from a corner of the cave and with difficulty wrenched open its lid candles he had in plenty and the cave was soon aglow clothes ten years old in cut scissors razors hats shoes all his discarded attire and belongings were dragged ruthlessly from their renunciatory rest and strewn about in painful disorder a pair of scissors soon reduced his beard sufficiently for the dulled razors to perform approximately their office cutting his own hair was beyond the hermit s skill so he only combed and brushed it backward as smoothly as he could charity forbids us to consider the heartburnings and exertions of one so long removed from haberdashery and society at the last the hermit went to an inner corner of his cave and began to dig in the soft earth with a long iron spoon out of the cavity he thus made he drew a tin can and out of the can three thousand dollars in bills tightly rolled and wrapped in oiled silk he was a real hermit as this may assure you you may take a brief look at him as he hastens down the little mountain side a long wrinkled black frock coat reached to his calves white duck trousers unacquainted with the tailor s goose a pink shirt white standing collar with brilliant blue butterfly tie and buttoned congress gaiters but think sir and madam ten years from beneath a narrow brimmed straw hat with a striped band flowed his hair seeing him with all your shrewdness you could not have guessed him you would have said that he played hamlet or the tuba or pinochle you would never have laid your hand on your heart and said he is a hermit who lived ten years in a cave for love of one lady to win another the dancing pavilion extended above the waters of the river gay lanterns and frosted electric globes shed a soft glamour within it a hundred ladies and gentlemen from the inn and summer cottages flitted in and about it to the left of the dusty roadway down which the hermit had tramped were the inn and grill room something seemed to be on there too the windows were brilliantly lighted and music was playing music different from the two steps and waltzes of the casino band a negro man wearing a white jacket came through the iron gate with its immense granite posts and wrought iron lamp holders what is going on here to night asked the hermit well sah said the servitor dey is having de reg lar thursday evenin dance in de casino and in de grill room dere s a beefsteak dinner sah the hermit glanced up at the inn on the hillside whence burst suddenly a triumphant strain of splendid harmony and up there said he they are playing mendelssohn what is going on up there up in de inn said the dusky one dey is a weddin goin on mr binkley a mighty rich man am marryin miss trenholme sah de young lady who am quite de belle of de place sah he also serves if i could have a thousand years just one little thousand years more of life i might in that time draw near enough to true romance to touch the hem of her robe up from ships men come and from waste places and forest and road and garret and cellar to maunder to me in strangely distributed words of the things they have seen and considered the recording of their tales is no more than a matter of ears and fingers there are only two fates i dread deafness and writer s cramp the hand is yet steady let the ear bear the blame if these printed words be not in the order they were delivered to me by hunky magee true camp follower of fortune biography shall claim you but an instant i first knew hunky when he was head waiter at chubb s little beefsteak restaurant and cafe on third avenue there was only one waiter besides then successively i caromed against him in the little streets of the big city after his trip to alaska his voyage as cook with a treasure seeking expedition to the caribbean and his failure as a pearl fisher in the arkansas river between these dashes into the land of adventure he usually came back to chubb s for a while chubb s was a port for him when gales blew too high but when you dined there and hunky went for your steak you never knew whether he would come to anchor in the kitchen or in the malayan archipelago you wouldn t care for his description he was soft of voice and hard of face and rarely had to use more than one eye to quell any approach to a disturbance among chubb s customers one night i found hunky standing at a corner of twenty third street and third avenue after an absence of several months in ten minutes we had a little round table between us in a quiet corner and my ears began to get busy i leave out my sly ruses and feints to draw hunky s word of mouth blows it all came to something like this speaking of the next election said hunky did you ever know much about indians no i don t mean the cooper beadle cigar store or laughing water kind i mean the modern indian the kind that takes greek prizes in colleges and scalps the half back on the other side in football games the kind that eats macaroons and tea in the afternoons with the daughter of the professor of biology and fills up on grasshoppers and fried rattlesnake when they get back to the ancestral wickiup well they ain t so bad i like em better than most foreigners that have come over in the last few hundred years one thing about the indian is this when he mixes with the white race he swaps all his own vices for them of the pale faces and he retains all his own virtues well his virtues are enough to call out the reserves whenever he lets em loose but the imported foreigners adopt our virtues and keep their own vices and it s going to take our whole standing army some day to police that gang but let me tell you about the trip i took to mexico with high jack snakefeeder a cherokee twice removed a graduate of a pennsylvania college and the latest thing in pointed toed rubber heeled patent kid moccasins and madras hunting shirt with turned back cuffs he was a friend of mine i met him in tahlequah when i was out there during the land boom and we got thick he had got all there was out of colleges and had come back to lead his people out of egypt he was a man of first class style and wrote essays and had been invited to visit rich guys houses in boston and such places there was a cherokee girl in muscogee that high jack was foolish about he took me to see her a few times her name was florence blue feather but you want to clear your mind of all ideas of squaws with nose rings and army blankets this young lady was whiter than you are and better educated than i ever was you couldn t have told her from any of the girls shopping in the swell third avenue stores i liked her so well that i got to calling on her now and then when high jack wasn t along which is the way of friends in such matters she was educated at the muscogee college and was making a specialty of let s see eth yes ethnology that s the art that goes back and traces the descent of different races of people leading up from jelly fish through monkeys and to the o briens high jack had took up that line too and had read papers about it before all kinds of riotous assemblies chautauquas and choctaws and chowder parties and such having a mutual taste for musty information like that was what made em like each other i suppose but i don t know what they call congeniality of tastes ain t always it now when miss blue feather and me was talking together i listened to her affidavits about the first families of the land of nod being cousins german well if the germans don t nod who does to the mound builders of ohio with incomprehension and respect and when i d tell her about the bowery and coney island and sing her a few songs that i d heard the jamaica niggers sing at their church lawn parties she didn t look much less interested than she did when high jack would tell her that he had a pipe that the first inhabitants of america originally arrived here on stilts after a freshet at tenafly new jersey but i was going to tell you more about high jack about six months ago i get a letter from him saying he d been commissioned by the minority report bureau of ethnology at washington to go down to mexico and translate some excavations or dig up the meaning of some shorthand notes on some ruins or something of that sort and if i d go along he could squeeze the price into the expense account well i d been holding a napkin over my arm at chubb s about long enough then so i wired high jack yes and he sent me a ticket and i met him in washington and he had a lot of news to tell me first of all was that florence blue feather had suddenly disappeared from her home and environments run away i asked vanished says high jack disappeared like your shadow when the sun goes under a cloud she was seen on the street and then she turned a corner and nobody ever seen her afterward the whole community turned out to look for her but we never found a clew that s bad that s bad says i she was a mighty nice girl and as smart as you find em high jack seemed to take it hard i guess he must have esteemed miss blue feather quite highly i could see that he d referred the matter to the whiskey jug that was his weak point and many another man s i ve noticed that when a man loses a girl he generally takes to drink either just before or just after it happens from washington we railroaded it to new orleans and there took a tramp steamer bound for belize and a gale pounded us all down the caribbean and nearly wrecked us on the yucatan coast opposite a little town without a harbor called boca de coacoyula suppose the ship had run against that name in the dark better fifty years of europe than a cyclone in the bay says high jack snakefeeder so we get the captain to send us ashore in a dory when the squall seemed to cease from squalling we will find ruins here or make em says high the government doesn t care which we do an appropriation is an appropriation boca de coacoyula was a dead town them biblical towns we read about tired and siphon after they was destroyed they must have looked like forty second street and broadway compared to this boca place it still claimed inhabitants as estimated and engraved on the stone court house by the census taker in the citizens were a mixture of indians and other indians but some of em was light colored which i was surprised to see the town was huddled up on the shore with woods so thick around it that a subpoena server couldn t have reached a monkey ten yards away with the papers we wondered what kept it from being annexed to kansas but we soon found out that it was major bing major bing was the ointment around the fly he had the cochineal sarsaparilla log wood annatto hemp and all other dye woods and pure food adulteration concessions cornered he had five sixths of the boca de thingama jiggers working for him on shares it was a beautiful graft we used to brag about morgan and e h and others of our wisest when i was in the provinces but now no more that peninsula has got our little country turned into a submarine without even the observation tower showing major bing s idea was this he had the population go forth into the forest and gather these products when they brought em in he gave em one fifth for their trouble sometimes they d strike and demand a sixth the major always gave in to em the major had a bungalow so close on the sea that the nine inch tide seeped through the cracks in the kitchen floor me and him and high jack snakefeeder sat on the porch and drank rum from noon till midnight he said he had piled up in new orleans banks and high and me could stay with him forever if we would but high jack happened to think of the united states and began to talk ethnology ruins says major bing the woods are full of em i don t know how far they date back but they was here before i came high jack asks what form of worship the citizens of that locality are addicted to why says the major rubbing his nose i can t hardly say i imagine it s infidel or aztec or nonconformist or something like that there s a church here a methodist or some other kind with a parson named skidder he claims to have converted the people to christianity he and me don t assimilate except on state occasions i imagine they worship some kind of gods or idols yet but skidder says he has em in the fold a few days later high jack and me prowling around strikes a plain path into the forest and follows it a good four miles then a branch turns to the left we go a mile maybe down that and run up against the finest ruin you ever saw solid stone with trees and vines and under brush all growing up against it and in it and through it all over it was chiselled carvings of funny beasts and people that would have been arrested if they d ever come out in vaudeville that way we approached it from the rear high jack had been drinking too much rum ever since we landed in boca you know how an indian is the palefaces fixed his clock when they introduced him to firewater he d brought a quart along with him hunky says he we ll explore the ancient temple it may be that the storin that landed us here was propitious the minority report bureau of ethnology says he may yet profit by the vagaries of wind and tide we went in the rear door of the bum edifice we struck a kind of alcove without bath there was a granite davenport and a stone wash stand without any soap or exit for the water and some hardwood pegs drove into holes in the wall and that was all to go out of that furnished apartment into a harlem hall bedroom would make you feel like getting back home from an amateur violoncello solo at an east side settlement house while high was examining some hieroglyphics on the wall that the stone masons must have made when their tools slipped i stepped into the front room that was at least thirty by fifty feet stone floor six little windows like square port holes that didn t let much light in i looked back over my shoulder and sees high jack s face three feet away high says i of all the and then i noticed he looked funny and i turned around he d taken off his clothes to the waist and he didn t seem to hear me i touched him and came near beating it high jack had turned to stone i had been drinking some rum myself ossified i says to him loudly i knew what would happen if you kept it up and then high jack comes in from the alcove when he hears me conversing with nobody and we have a look at mr snakefeeder no it s a stone idol or god or revised statute or something and it looks as much like high jack as one green pea looks like itself it s got exactly his face and size and color but it s steadier on its pins it stands on a kind of rostrum or pedestal and you can see it s been there ten million years he s a cousin of mine sings high and then he turns solemn hunky he says putting one hand on my shoulder and one on the statue s i m in the holy temple of my ancestors well if looks goes for anything says i you ve struck a twin stand side by side with buddy and let s see if there s any diff erence there wasn t you know an indian can keep his face as still as an iron dog s when he wants to so when high jack froze his features you couldn t have told him from the other one there s some letters says i on his nob s pedestal but i can t make em out the alphabet of this country seems to be composed of sometimes a e i o and u but generally z s l s and t s high jack s ethnology gets the upper hand of his rum for a minute and he investigates the inscription hunky says he this is a statue of tlotopaxl one of the most powerful gods of the ancient aztecs glad to know him says i but in his present condition he reminds me of the joke shakespeare got off on julius caesar we might say about your friend imperious what s his name dead and tunied to stone no use to write or call him on the phone hunky says high jack snakefeeder looking at me funny do you believe in reincarnation it sounds to me says i like either a clean up of the slaughter houses or a new kind of boston pink i don t know i believe says he that i am the reincarnation of tlotopaxl my researches have convinced me that the cherokees of all the north american tribes can boast of the straightest descent from the proud aztec race that says he was a favorite theory of mine and florence blue feather s and she what if she high jack grabs my arm and walls his eyes at me just then he looked more like his eminent co indian murderer crazy horse well says i what if she what if she what if she you re drunk says i impersonating idols and believing in what was it recarnalization let s have a drink says i it s as spooky here as a brooklyn artificial limb factory at midnight with the gas turned down just then i heard somebody coming and i dragged high jack into the bedless bedchamber there was peep holes bored through the wall so we could see the whole front part of the temple major bing told me afterward that the ancient priests in charge used to rubber through them at the congregation in a few minutes an old indian woman came in with a big oval earthen dish full of grub she set it on a square block of stone in front of the graven image and laid down and walloped her face on the floor a few times and then took a walk for herself high jack and me was hungry so we came out and looked it over there was goat steaks and fried rice cakes and plantains and cassava and broiled land crabs and mangoes nothing like what you get at chubb s we ate hearty and had another round of rum it must be old tecumseh s or whatever you call him birthday says i or do they feed him every day i thought gods only drank vanilla on mount catawampus then some more native parties in short kimonos that showed their aboriginees punctured the near horizon and me and high had to skip back into father axletree s private boudoir they came by ones twos and threes and left all sorts of offerings there was enough grub for bingham s nine gods of war with plenty left over for the peace conference at the hague they brought jars of honey and bunches of bananas and bottles of wine and stacks of tortillas and beautiful shawls worth one hundred dollars apiece that the indian women weave of a kind of vegetable fibre like silk all of em got down and wriggled on the floor in front of that hard finish god and then sneaked off through the woods again i wonder who gets this rake off remarks high jack oh says i there s priests or deputy idols or a committee of disarrangements somewhere in the woods on the job wherever you find a god you ll find somebody waiting to take charge of the burnt offerings and then we took another swig of rum and walked out to the parlor front door to cool off for it was as hot inside as a summer camp on the palisades and while we stood there in the breeze we looks down the path and sees a young lady approaching the blasted ruin she was bare footed and had on a white robe and carried a wreath of white flowers in her hand when she got nearer we saw she had a long blue feather stuck through her black hair and when she got nearer still me and high jack snakefeeder grabbed each other to keep from tumbling down on the floor for the girl s face was as much like florence blue feather s as his was like old king toxicology s and then was when high jack s booze drowned his system of ethnology he dragged me inside back of the statue and says lay hold of it hunky we ll pack it into the other room i felt it all the time says he i m the reconsideration of the god locomotorataxia and florence blue feather was my bride a thousand years ago she has come to seek me in the temple where i used to reign all right says i there s no use arguing against the rum question you take his feet we lifted the three hundred pound stone god and carried him into the back room of the cafe the temple i mean and leaned him against the wall it was more work than bouncing three live ones from an all night broadway joint on new year s eve then high jack ran out and brought in a couple of them indian silk shawls and began to undress himself oh figs says i is it thus strong drink is an adder and subtractor too is it the heat or the call of the wild that s got you but high jack is too full of exaltation and cane juice to reply he stops the disrobing business just short of the manhattan beach rules and then winds them red and white shawls around him and goes out and stands on the pedestal as steady as any platinum deity you ever saw and i looks through a peek hole to see what he is up to in a few minutes in comes the girl with the flower wreath danged if i wasn t knocked a little silly when she got close she looked so exactly much like florence blue feather i wonder says i to myself if she has been reincarcerated too if i could see says i to myself whether she has a mole on her left but the next minute i thought she looked one eighth of a shade darker than florence but she looked good at that and high jack hadn t drunk all the rum that had been drank the girl went up within ten feet of the bum idol and got down and massaged her nose with the floor like the rest did then she went nearer and laid the flower wreath on the block of stone at high jack s feet rummy as i was i thought it was kind of nice of her to think of offering flowers instead of household and kitchen provisions even a stone god ought to appreciate a little sentiment like that on top of the fancy groceries they had piled up in front of him and then high jack steps down from his pedestal quiet and mentions a few words that sounded just like the hieroglyphics carved on the walls of the ruin the girl gives a little jump backward and her eyes fly open as big as doughnuts but she don t beat it why didn t she i ll tell you why i think why it don t seem to a girl so supernatural unlikely strange and startling that a stone god should come to life for her if he was to do it for one of them snub nosed brown girls on the other side of the woods now it would be different but her i ll bet she said to herself well goodness me you ve been a long time getting on your job i ve half a mind not to speak to you but she and high jack holds hands and walks away out of the temple together by the time i d had time to take another drink and enter upon the scene they was twenty yards away going up the path in the woods that the girl had come down with the natural scenery already in place it was just like a play to watch em she looking up at him and him giving her back the best that an indian can hand out in the way of a goo goo eye but there wasn t anything in that recarnification and revulsion to tintype for me hey injun i yells out to high jack we ve got a board bill due in town and you re leaving me without a cent brace up and cut out the neapolitan fisher maiden and let s go back home but on the two goes without looking once back until as you might say the forest swallowed em up and i never saw or heard of high jack snakefeeder from that day to this i don t know if the cherokees came from the aspics but if they did one of em went back all i could do was to hustle back to that boca place and panhandle major bing he detached himself from enough of his winnings to buy me a ticket home and i m back again on the job at chubb s sir and i m going to hold it steady come round and you ll find the steaks as good as ever i wondered what hunky magee thought about his own story so i asked him if he had any theories about reincarnation and transmogrification and such mysteries as he had touched upon nothing like that said hunky positively what ailed high jack was too much booze and education they ll do an indian up every time but what about miss blue feather i persisted say said hunky with a grin that little lady that stole high jack certainly did give me a jar when i first took a look at her but it was only for a minute you remember i told you high jack said that miss florence blue feather disappeared from home about a year ago well where she landed four days later was in as neat a five room flat on east twenty third street as you ever walked sideways through and she s been mrs magee ever since the moment of victory ben granger is a war veteran aged twenty nine which should enable you to guess the war he is also principal merchant and postmaster of cadiz a little town over which the breezes from the gulf of mexico perpetually blow ben helped to hurl the don from his stronghold in the greater antilles and then hiking across half the world he marched as a corporal usher up and down the blazing tropic aisles of the open air college in which the filipino was schooled now with his bayonet beaten into a cheese slicer he rallies his corporal s guard of cronies in the shade of his well whittled porch instead of in the matted jungles of mindanao always have his interest and choice been for deeds rather than for words but the consideration and digestion of motives is not beyond him as this story which is his will attest what is it he asked me one moonlit eve as we sat among his boxes and barrels that generally makes men go through dangers and fire and trouble and starvation and battle and such rucouses what does a man do it for why does he try to outdo his fellow humans and be braver and stronger and more daring and showy than even his best friends are what s his game what does he expect to get out of it he don t do it just for the fresh air and exercise what would you say now bill that an ordinary man expects generally speaking for his efforts along the line of ambition and extraordinary hustling in the marketplaces forums shooting galleries lyceums battle fields links cinder paths and arenas of the civilized and vice versa places of the world well ben said i with judicial seriousness i think we might safely limit the number of motives of a man who seeks fame to three to ambition which is a desire for popular applause to avarice which looks to the material side of success and to love of some woman whom he either possesses or desires to possess ben pondered over my words while a mocking bird on the top of a mesquite by the porch trilled a dozen bars i reckon said he that your diagnosis about covers the case according to the rules laid down in the copy books and historical readers but what i had in my mind was the case of willie robbins a person i used to know i ll tell you about him before i close up the store if you don t mind listening willie was one of our social set up in san augustine i was clerking there then for brady murchison wholesale dry goods and ranch supplies willie and i belonged to the same german club and athletic association and military company he played the triangle in our serenading and quartet crowd that used to ring the welkin three nights a week somewhere in town willie jibed with his name considerable he weighed about as much as a hundred pounds of veal in his summer suitings and he had a where is mary expression on his features so plain that you could almost see the wool growing on him and yet you couldn t fence him away from the girls with barbed wire you know that kind of young fellows a kind of a mixture of fools and angels they rush in and fear to tread at the same time but they never fail to tread when they get the chance he was always on hand when a joyful occasion was had as the morning paper would say looking as happy as a king full and at the same time as uncomfortable as a raw oyster served with sweet pickles he danced like he had hind hobbles on and he had a vocabulary of about three hundred and fifty words that he made stretch over four germans a week and plagiarized from to get him through two ice cream suppers and a sunday night call he seemed to me to be a sort of a mixture of maltese kitten sensitive plant and a member of a stranded two orphans company i ll give you an estimate of his physiological and pictorial make up and then i ll stick spurs into the sides of my narrative willie inclined to the caucasian in his coloring and manner of style his hair was opalescent and his conversation fragmentary his eyes were the same blue shade as the china dog s on the right hand corner of your aunt ellen s mantelpiece he took things as they come and i never felt any hostility against him i let him live and so did others but what does this willie do but coax his heart out of his boots and lose it to myra allison the liveliest brightest keenest smartest and prettiest girl in san augustine i tell you she had the blackest eyes the shiniest curls and the most tantalizing oh no you re off i wasn t a victim i might have been but i knew better i kept out joe granberry was it from the start he had everybody else beat a couple of leagues and thence east to a stake and mound but anyhow myra was a nine pound full merino fall clip fleece sacked and loaded on a four horse team for san antone one night there was an ice cream sociable at mrs colonel spraggins in san augustine we fellows had a big room up stairs opened up for us to put our hats and things in and to comb our hair and put on the clean collars we brought along inside the sweat bands of our hats in short a room to fix up in just like they have everywhere at high toned doings a little farther down the hall was the girls room which they used to powder up in and so forth downstairs we that is the san augustine social cotillion and merrymakers club had a stretcher put down in the parlor where our dance was going on willie robbins and me happened to be up in our cloak room i believe we called it when myra allison skipped through the hall on her way down stairs from the girls room willie was standing before the mirror deeply interested in smoothing down the blond grass plot on his head which seemed to give him lots of trouble myra was always full of life and devilment she stopped and stuck her head in our door she certainly was good looking but i knew how joe granberry stood with her so did willie but he kept on ba a a ing after her and following her around he had a system of persistence that didn t coincide with pale hair and light eyes hello willie says myra what are you doing to yourself in the glass i m trying to look fly says willie well you never could be fly says myra with her special laugh which was the provokingest sound i ever heard except the rattle of an empty canteen against my saddle horn i looked around at willie after myra had gone he had a kind of a lily white look on him which seemed to show that her remark had as you might say disrupted his soul i never noticed anything in what she said that sounded particularly destructive to a man s ideas of self consciousness but he was set back to an extent you could scarcely imagine after we went down stairs with our clean collars on willie never went near myra again that night after all he seemed to be a diluted kind of a skim milk sort of a chap and i never wondered that joe granberry beat him out the next day the battleship maine was blown up and then pretty soon somebody i reckon it was joe bailey or ben tillman or maybe the government declared war against spain well everybody south of mason hamlin s line knew that the north by itself couldn t whip a whole country the size of spain so the yankees commenced to holler for help and the johnny rebs answered the call we re coming father william a hundred thousand strong and then some was the way they sang it and the old party lines drawn by sherman s march and the kuklux and nine cent cotton and the jim crow street car ordinances faded away we became one undivided country with no north very little east a good sized chunk of west and a south that loomed up as big as the first foreign label on a new eight dollar suit case of course the dogs of war weren t a complete pack without a yelp from the san augustine rifles company d of the fourteenth texas regiment our company was among the first to land in cuba and strike terror into the hearts of the foe i m not going to give you a history of the war i m just dragging it in to fill out my story about willie robbins just as the republican party dragged it in to help out the election in if anybody ever had heroitis it was that willie robbins from the minute he set foot on the soil of the tyrants of castile he seemed to engulf danger as a cat laps up cream he certainly astonished every man in our company from the captain up you d have expected him to gravitate naturally to the job of an orderly to the colonel or typewriter in the commissary but not any he created the part of the flaxen haired boy hero who lives and gets back home with the goods instead of dying with an important despatch in his hands at his colonel s feet our company got into a section of cuban scenery where one of the messiest and most unsung portions of the campaign occurred we were out every day capering around in the bushes and having little skirmishes with the spanish troops that looked more like kind of tired out feuds than anything else the war was a joke to us and of no interest to them we never could see it any other way than as a howling farce comedy that the san augustine rifles were actually fighting to uphold the stars and stripes and the blamed little senors didn t get enough pay to make them care whether they were patriots or traitors now and then somebody would get killed it seemed like a waste of life to me i was at coney island when i went to new york once and one of them down hill skidding apparatuses they call roller coasters flew the track and killed a man in a brown sack suit whenever the spaniards shot one of our men it struck me as just about as unnecessary and regrettable as that was but i m dropping willie robbins out of the conversation he was out for bloodshed laurels ambition medals recommendations and all other forms of military glory and he didn t seem to be afraid of any of the recognized forms of military danger such as spaniards cannon balls canned beef gunpowder or nepotism he went forth with his pallid hair and china blue eyes and ate up spaniards like you would sardines a la canopy wars and rumbles of wars never flustered him he would stand guard duty mosquitoes hardtack treat and fire with equally perfect unanimity no blondes in history ever come in comparison distance of him except the jack of diamonds and queen catherine of russia i remember one time a little caballard of spanish men sauntered out from behind a patch of sugar cane and shot bob turner the first sergeant of our company while we were eating dinner as required by the army regulations we fellows went through the usual tactics of falling into line saluting the enemy and loading and firing kneeling that wasn t the texas way of scrapping but being a very important addendum and annex to the regular army the san augustine rifles had to conform to the red tape system of getting even by the time we had got out our upton s tactics turned to page fifty seven said one two three one two three a couple of times and got blank cartridges into our springfields the spanish outfit had smiled repeatedly rolled and lit cigarettes by squads and walked away contemptuously i went straight to captain floyd and says to him sam i don t think this war is a straight game you know as well as i do that bob turner was one of the whitest fellows that ever threw a leg over a saddle and now these wirepullers in washington have fixed his clock he s politically and ostensibly dead it ain t fair why should they keep this thing up if they want spain licked why don t they turn the san augustine rifles and joe seely s ranger company and a car load of west texas deputy sheriffs onto these spaniards and let us exonerate them from the face of the earth i never did says i care much about fighting by the lord chesterfield ring rules i m going to hand in my resignation and go home if anybody else i am personally acquainted with gets hurt in this war if you can get somebody in my place sam says i i ll quit the first of next week i don t want to work in an army that don t give its help a chance never mind my wages says i let the secretary of the treasury keep em well ben says the captain to me your allegations and estimations of the tactics of war government patriotism guard mounting and democracy are all right but i ve looked into the system of international arbitration and the ethics of justifiable slaughter a little closer maybe than you have now you can hand in your resignation the first of next week if you are so minded but if you do says sam i ll order a corporal s guard to take you over by that limestone bluff on the creek and shoot enough lead into you to ballast a submarine air ship i m captain of this company and i ve swore allegiance to the amalgamated states regardless of sectional secessional and congressional differences have you got any smoking tobacco winds up sam mine got wet when i swum the creek this morning the reason i drag all this non ex parte evidence in is because willie robbins was standing there listening to us i was a second sergeant and he was a private then but among us texans and westerners there never was as much tactics and subordination as there was in the regular army we never called our captain anything but sam except when there was a lot of major generals and admirals around so as to preserve the discipline and says willie robbins to me in a sharp construction of voice much unbecoming to his light hair and previous record you ought to be shot ben for emitting any such sentiments a man that won t fight for his country is worse than a horse thief if i was the cap i d put you in the guard house for thirty days on round steak and tamales war says willie is great and glorious i didn t know you were a coward i m not says i if i was i d knock some of the pallidness off of your marble brow i m lenient with you i says just as i am with the spaniards because you have always reminded me of something with mushrooms on the side why you little lady of shalott says i you underdone leader of cotillions you glassy fashion and moulded form you white pine soldier made in the cisalpine alps in germany for the late new year trade do you know of whom you are talking to we ve been in the same social circle says i and i ve put up with you because you seemed so meek and self un satisfying i don t understand why you have so sudden taken a personal interest in chivalrousness and murder your nature s undergone a complete revelation now how is it well you wouldn t understand ben says willie giving one of his refined smiles and turning away come back here says i catching him by the tail of his khaki coat you ve made me kind of mad in spite of the aloofness in which i have heretofore held you you are out for making a success in this hero business and i believe i know what for you are doing it either because you are crazy or because you expect to catch some girl by it now if it s a girl i ve got something here to show you i wouldn t have done it but i was plumb mad i pulled a san augustine paper out of my hip pocket and showed him an item it was a half a column about the marriage of myra allison and joe granberry willie laughed and i saw i hadn t touched him oh says he everybody knew that was going to happen i heard about that a week ago and then he gave me the laugh again all right says i then why do you so recklessly chase the bright rainbow of fame do you expect to be elected president or do you belong to a suicide club and then captain sam interferes you gentlemen quit jawing and go back to your quarters says he or i ll have you escorted to the guard house now scat both of you before you go which one of you has got any chewing tobacco we re off sam says i it s supper time anyhow but what do you think of what we was talking about i ve noticed you throwing out a good many grappling hooks for this here balloon called fame what s ambition anyhow what does a man risk his life day after day for do you know of anything he gets in the end that can pay him for the trouble i want to go back home says i i don t care whether cuba sinks or swims and i don t give a pipeful of rabbit tobacco whether queen sophia christina or charlie culberson rules these fairy isles and i don t want my name on any list except the list of survivors but i ve noticed you sam says i seeking the bubble notoriety in the cannon s larynx a number of times now what do you do it for is it ambition business or some freckle faced pheebe at home that you are heroing for well ben says sam kind of hefting his sword out from between his knees as your superior officer i could court martial you for attempted cowardice and desertion but i won t and i ll tell you why i m trying for promotion and the usual honors of war and conquest a major gets more pay than a captain and i need the money correct for you says i i can understand that your system of fame seeking is rooted in the deepest soil of patriotism but i can t comprehend says i why willie robbins whose folks at home are well off and who used to be as meek and undesirous of notice as a cat with cream on his whiskers should all at once develop into a warrior bold with the most fire eating kind of proclivities and the girl in his case seems to have been eliminated by marriage to another fellow i reckon says i it s a plain case of just common ambition he wants his name maybe to go thundering down the coroners of time it must be that well without itemizing his deeds willie sure made good as a hero he simply spent most of his time on his knees begging our captain to send him on forlorn hopes and dangerous scouting expeditions in every fight he was the first man to mix it at close quarters with the don alfonsos he got three or four bullets planted in various parts of his autonomy once he went off with a detail of eight men and captured a whole company of spanish he kept captain floyd busy writing out recommendations of his bravery to send in to head quarters and he began to accumulate medals for all kinds of things heroism and target shooting and valor and tactics and uninsubordination and all the little accomplishments that look good to the third assistant secretaries of the war department finally cap floyd got promoted to be a major general or a knight commander of the main herd or something like that he pounded around on a white horse all desecrated up with gold leaf and hen feathers and a good templar s hat and wasn t allowed by the regulations to speak to us and willie robbins was made captain of our company and maybe he didn t go after the wreath of fame then as far as i could see it was him that ended the war he got eighteen of us boys friends of his too killed in battles that he stirred up himself and that didn t seem to me necessary at all one night he took twelve of us and waded through a little nil about a hundred and ninety yards wide and climbed a couple of mountains and sneaked through a mile of neglected shrubbery and a couple of rock quarries and into a rye straw village and captured a spanish general named as they said benny veedus benny seemed to me hardly worth the trouble being a blackish man without shoes or cuffs and anxious to surrender and throw himself on the commissary of his foe but that job gave willie the big boost he wanted the san augustine news and the galveston st louis new york and kansas city papers printed his picture and columns of stuff about him old san augustine simply went crazy over its gallant son the news had an editorial tearfully begging the government to call off the regular army and the national guard and let willie carry on the rest of the war single handed it said that a refusal to do so would be regarded as a proof that the northern jealousy of the south was still as rampant as ever if the war hadn t ended pretty soon i don t know to what heights of gold braid and encomiums willie would have climbed but it did there was a secession of hostilities just three days after he was appointed a colonel and got in three more medals by registered mail and shot two spaniards while they were drinking lemonade in an ambuscade our company went back to san augustine when the war was over there wasn t anywhere else for it to go and what do you think the old town notified us in print by wire cable special delivery and a nigger named saul sent on a gray mule to san antone that they was going to give us the biggest blow out complimentary alimentary and elementary that ever disturbed the kildees on the sand flats outside of the immediate contiguity of the city i say we but it was all meant for ex private captain de facto and colonel elect willie robbins the town was crazy about him they notified us that the reception they were going to put up would make the mardi gras in new orleans look like an afternoon tea in bury st edmunds with a curate s aunt well the san augustine rifles got back home on schedule time everybody was at the depot giving forth roosevelt democrat they used to be called rebel yells there was two brass bands and the mayor and schoolgirls in white frightening the street car horses by throwing cherokee roses in the streets and well maybe you ve seen a celebration by a town that was inland and out of water they wanted brevet colonel willie to get into a carriage and be drawn by prominent citizens and some of the city aldermen to the armory but he stuck to his company and marched at the head of it up sam houston avenue the buildings on both sides was covered with flags and audiences and everybody hollered robbins or hello willie as we marched up in files of fours i never saw a illustriouser looking human in my life than willie was he had at least seven or eight medals and diplomas and decorations on the breast of his khaki coat he was sunburnt the color of a saddle and he certainly done himself proud they told us at the depot that the courthouse was to be illuminated at half past seven and there would be speeches and chili con came at the palace hotel miss delphine thompson was to read an original poem by james whitcomb ryan and constable hooker had promised us a salute of nine guns from chicago that he had arrested that day after we had disbanded in the armory willie says to me want to walk out a piece with me why yes says i if it ain t so far that we can t hear the tumult and the shouting die away i m hungry myself says i and i m pining for some home grub but i ll go with you willie steered me down some side streets till we came to a little white cottage in a new lot with a twenty by thirty foot lawn decorated with brickbats and old barrel staves halt and give the countersign says i to willie don t you know this dugout it s the bird s nest that joe granberry built before he married myra allison what you going there for but willie already had the gate open he walked up the brick walk to the steps and i went with him myra was sitting in a rocking chair on the porch sewing her hair was smoothed back kind of hasty and tied in a knot i never noticed till then that she had freckles joe was at one side of the porch in his shirtsleeves with no collar on and no signs of a shave trying to scrape out a hole among the brickbats and tin cans to plant a little fruit tree in he looked up but never said a word and neither did myra willie was sure dandy looking in his uniform with medals strung on his breast and his new gold handled sword you d never have taken him for the little white headed snipe that the girls used to order about and make fun of he just stood there for a minute looking at myra with a peculiar little smile on his face and then he says to her slow and kind of holding on to his words with his teeth oh i don t know maybe i could if i tried that was all that was said willie raised his hat and we walked away and somehow when he said that i remembered all of a sudden the night of that dance and willie brushing his hair before the looking glass and myra sticking her head in the door to guy him when we got back to sam houston avenue willie

down the main street the boomers having bad luck all the time after a while we leaned forward and shoved for the ranch down on the ceriso we were riding a couple of horses that couldn t fly but they could catch birds a few days after that a gang of the la junta boomers came to the ranch and wanted us to go back with them naturally we declined we had the house on them and before we were done refusing that old dobe was plumb full of lead when dark came we fagged em a batch of bullets and shoved out the back door for the rocks they sure smoked us as we went we had to drift which we did and rounded up down in oklahoma well there wasn t anything we could get there and being mighty hard up we decided to transact a little business with the railroads jim and i joined forces with tom and ike moore two brothers who had plenty of sand they were willing to convert into dust i can call their names for both of them are dead tom was shot while robbing a bank in arkansas ike was killed during the more dangerous pastime of attending a dance in the creek nation we selected a place on the santa fe where there was a bridge across a deep creek surrounded by heavy timber all passenger trains took water at the tank close to one end of the bridge it was a quiet place the nearest house being five miles away the day before it happened we rested our horses and made medicine as to how we should get about it our plans were not at all elaborate as none of us had ever engaged in a hold up before the santa fe flyer was due at the tank at p m at eleven tom and i lay down on one side of the track and jim and ike took the other as the train rolled up the headlight flashing far down the track and the steam hissing from the engine i turned weak all over i would have worked a whole year on the ranch for nothing to have been out of that affair right then some of the nerviest men in the business have told me that they felt the same way the first time the engine had hardly stopped when i jumped on the running board on one side while jim mounted the other as soon as the engineer and fireman saw our guns they threw up their hands without being told and begged us not to shoot saying they would do anything we wanted them to hit the ground i ordered and they both jumped off we drove them before us down the side of the train while this was happening tom and ike had been blazing away one on each side of the train yelling like apaches so as to keep the passengers herded in the cars some fellow stuck a little twenty two calibre out one of the coach windows and fired it straight up in the air i let drive and smashed the glass just over his head that settled everything like resistance from that direction by this time all my nervousness was gone i felt a kind of pleasant excitement as if i were at a dance or a frolic of some sort the lights were all out in the coaches and as tom and ike gradually quit firing and yelling it got to be almost as still as a graveyard i remember hearing a little bird chirping in a bush at the side of the track as if it were complaining at being waked up i made the fireman get a lantern and then i went to the express car and yelled to the messenger to open up or get perforated he slid the door back and stood in it with his hands up jump overboard son i said and he hit the dirt like a lump of lead there were two safes in the car a big one and a little one by the way i first located the messenger s arsenal a double barrelled shot gun with buckshot cartridges and a thirty eight in a drawer i drew the cartridges from the shot gun pocketed the pistol and called the messenger inside i shoved my gun against his nose and put him to work he couldn t open the big safe but he did the little one there was only nine hundred dollars in it that was mighty small winnings for our trouble so we decided to go through the passengers we took our prisoners to the smoking car and from there sent the engineer through the train to light up the coaches beginning with the first one we placed a man at each door and ordered the passengers to stand between the seats with their hands up if you want to find out what cowards the majority of men are all you have to do is rob a passenger train i don t mean because they don t resist i ll tell you later on why they can t do that but it makes a man feel sorry for them the way they lose their heads big burly drummers and farmers and ex soldiers and high collared dudes and sports that a few moments before were filling the car with noise and bragging get so scared that their ears flop there were very few people in the day coaches at that time of night so we made a slim haul until we got to the sleeper the pullman conductor met me at one door while jim was going round to the other one he very politely informed me that i could not go into that car as it did not belong to the railroad company and besides the passengers had already been greatly disturbed by the shouting and

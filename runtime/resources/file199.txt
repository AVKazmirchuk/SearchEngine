weakfish he got up put his arm around tildy s waist kissed her loudly and impudently walked out upon the street snapped his fingers in the direction of the laundry and hied himself to play pennies in the slot machines at the amusement arcade for a few moments tildy stood petrified then she was aware of aileen shaking at her an arch forefinger and saying why til you naughty girl ain t you getting to be awful miss slyboots first thing i know you ll be stealing some of my fellows i must keep an eye on you my lady another thing dawned upon tildy s recovering wits in a moment she had advanced from a hopeless lowly admirer to be an eve sister of the potent aileen she herself was now a man charmer a mark for cupid a sabine who must be coy when the romans were at their banquet boards man had found her waist achievable and her lips desirable the sudden and amatory seeders had as it were performed for her a miraculous piece of one day laundry work he had taken the sackcloth of her uncomeliness had washed dried starched and ironed it and returned it to her sheer embroidered lawn the robe of venus herself the freckles on tildy s cheeks merged into a rosy flush now both circe and psyche peeped from her brightened eyes not even aileen herself had been publicly embraced and kissed in the restaurant tildy could not keep the delightful secret when trade was slack she went and stood at bogle s desk her eyes were shining she tried not to let her words sound proud and boastful a gentleman insulted me to day she said he hugged me around the waist and kissed me that so said bogle cracking open his business armour after this week you get a dollar a week more at the next regular meal when tildy set food before customers with whom she had acquaintance she said to each of them modestly as one whose merit needed no bolstering a gentleman insulted me to day in the restaurant he put his arm around my waist and kissed me the diners accepted the revelation in various ways some incredulously some with congratulations others turned upon her the stream of badinage that had hitherto been directed at aileen alone and tildy s heart swelled in her bosom for she saw at last the towers of romance rise above the horizon of the grey plain in which she had for so long travelled for two days mr seeders came not again during that time tildy established herself firmly as a woman to be wooed she bought ribbons and arranged her hair like aileen s and tightened her waist two inches she had a thrilling but delightful fear that mr seeders would rush in suddenly and shoot her with a pistol he must have loved her desperately and impulsive lovers are always blindly jealous even aileen had not been shot at with a pistol and then tildy rather hoped that he would not shoot at her for she was always loyal to aileen and she did not want to overshadow her friend at o clock on the afternoon of the third day mr seeders came in there were no customers at the tables at the back end of the restaurant tildy was refilling the mustard pots and aileen was quartering pies mr seeders walked back to where they stood tildy looked up and saw him gasped and pressed the mustard spoon against her heart a red hair bow was in her hair she wore venus s eighth avenue badge the blue bead necklace with the swinging silver symbolic heart mr seeders was flushed and embarrassed he plunged one hand into his hip pocket and the other into a fresh pumpkin pie miss tildy said he i want to apologise for what i done the other evenin tell you the truth i was pretty well tanked up or i wouldn t of done it i wouldn t do no lady that a way when i was sober so i hope miss tildy you ll accept my pology and believe that i wouldn t of done it if i d known what i was doin and hadn t of been drunk with this handsome plea

sobbing her heart out out and back again to the grey plain wherein travel they with blunt noses and hay coloured hair from her knot she had torn the red hair bow and cast it upon the floor seeders she despised utterly she had but taken his kiss as that of a pioneer and prophetic prince who might have set the clocks going and the pages to running in fairyland but the kiss had been maudlin and unmeant the court had not stirred at the false alarm she must forevermore remain the sleeping beauty yet not all was lost aileen s arm was around her and tildy s red hand groped among the butter chips

my pocket for taking you back with me and you are going we will return on the fruit steamer that comes back by this island to morrow to leave its inspectors i acknowledge gentlemen that i m not quite sure which one of you is williams but wade williams goes back to chatham county to morrow i want you to understand that a great sound of merry laughter from morgan and reeves went out over the still harbour two or three fishermen in the fleet of sloops anchored there looked up at the house of the diablos americanos on the hill and wondered my dear mr plunkett cried morgan conquering his mirth the dinner is getting cold let us sit down and eat i am anxious to get my spoon into that shark fin soup business afterward sit down gentlemen if you please added reeves pleasantly i am sure mr plunkett will not object perhaps a little time may be of advantage to him in identi fying the gentlemen he wishes to arrest no objections i m sure said plunkett dropping into his chair heavily i m hungry myself i didn t want to accept the hospitality of you folks without giving you notice that s all reeves set bottles and glasses on the table there s cognac he said and anisada and scotch smoke and rye take your choice bridger chose rye reeves poured three fingers of scotch for himself morgan took the same the sheriff against much protestation filled his glass from the water bottle here s to the appetite said reeves raising his glass of mr williams morgan s laugh and his drink encountering sent him into a choking splutter all began to pay attention to the dinner which was well cooked and palatable williams called plunkett suddenly and sharply all looked up wonderingly reeves found the sheriff s mild eye resting upon him he flushed a little see here he said with some asperity my name s reeves and i don t want you too but the comedy of the thing came to his rescue and he ended with a laugh i suppose mr plunkett said morgan carefully seasoning an alligator pear that you are aware of the fact that you will import a good deal of trouble for your self into kentucky if you take back the wrong man that is of course if you take anybody back thank you for the salt said the sheriff oh i ll take somebody back it ll be one of you two gentlemen yes i know i d get stuck for damages if i make a mis take but i m going to try to get the right man i ll tell you what you do said morgan leaning for ward with a jolly twinkle in his eyes you take me i ll go without any trouble the cocoanut business hasn t panned out well this year and i d like to make some extra money out of your bondsmen that s not fair chimed in reeves i got only a thousand for my last shipment take me mr plunkett i ll take wade williams said the sheriff patiently or i ll come pretty close to it it s like dining with a ghost remarked morgan with a pretended shiver the ghost of a murderer too will somebody pass the toothpicks to the shade of the naughty mr williams plunkett seemed as unconcerned as if he were dining at his own table in chatham county he was a gallant trencherman and the strange tropic viands tickled his palate heavy commonplace almost slothful in his movements he appeared to be devoid of all the cunning and watchfulness of the sleuth he even ceased to observe with any sharpness or attempted discrimination the two men one of whom he had undertaken with sur prising self confidence to drag away upon the serious charge of wife murder here indeed was a problem set before him that if wrongly solved would have amounted to his serious discomfiture yet there he sat puzzling his soul to all appearances over the novel flavour of a broiled iguana cutlet the consul felt a decided discomfort reeves and morgan were his friends and pals yet the sheriff from kentucky had a certain right to his official aid and moral support so bridger sat the silentest around the board and tried to estimate the peculiar situation his con clusion was that both reeves and morgan quickwitted as he knew them to be had conceived at the moment of plunkett s disclosure of his mission and in the brief space of a lightning flash the idea that the other might be the guilty williams and that each of them had decided in that moment loyally to protect his comrade against the doom that threatened him this was the consul s theory and if he had been a bookmaker at a race of wits for life and liberty he would have offered heavy odds against the plodding sheriff from chatham county kentucky when the meal was concluded the carib woman came and removed the dishes and cloth reeves strewed them table with excellent cigars and plunkett with the others lighted one of these with evident gratification i may be dull said morgan with a grin and a wink at bridger but i want to know if i am now i say this is all a joke of mr plunkett s concocted to frighten two babes in the woods is this williamson to be taken seriously or not williams corrected plunkett gravely i never got off any jokes in my life i know i wouldn t travel miles to get off a poor one as this would be if i didn t take wade williams back with me gentlemen continued the sheriff now letting his mild eyes travel impartially from one of the company to another see if you can find any joke in this case wade williams is listening to the words i utter now but out of politeness i will speak of him as a third person for five years he made his wife lead the life of a dog no i ll take that back no dog in kentucky was ever treated as she was he spent the money that she brought him spent it at races at the card table and on horses and hunting he was a good fellow to his friends but a cold sullen demon at home he wound up the five years of neglect by strik ing her with his closed hand a hand as hard as a stone when she was ill and weak from suffering she died the next day and he skipped that s all there is to it it s enough i never saw williams but i knew his wife i m not a man to tell half she and i were keep ing company when she met him she went to louisville on a visit and saw him there i ll admit that he spoilt my chances in no time i lived then on the edge of the cumberland mountains i was elected sheriff of chatham county a year after wade williams killed his wife my official duty sends me out here after him but i ll admit that there s personal feeling too and he s going back with me mr er reeves will you pass me a match awfully imprudent of williams said morgan putting his feet up against the wall to strike a kentucky lady seems to me i ve heard they were scrappers bad bad williams said reeves pouring out more scotch the two men spoke lightly but the consul saw and felt the tension and the carefulness in their actions and words good old fellows he said to himself they re both all right each of em is standing by the other like a little brick church and then a dog walked into the room where they sat a black and tan hound long eared lazy confident of welcome plunkett turned his head and looked at the animal which halted confidently within a few feet of his chair suddenly the sheriff with a deep mouthed oath left his seat and bestowed upon the dog a vicious and heavy kick with his ponderous shoe the hound heartbroken astonished with flapping ears and incurved tail uttered a piercing yelp of pain and surprise reeves and the consul remained in their chairs say ing nothing but astonished at the unexpected show of intolerance from the easy going man from chatham county but morgan with a suddenly purpling face leaped to his feet and raised a threatening arm above the guest you brute he shouted passionately why did you do that quickly the amenities returned plunkett muttered some indistinct apology and regained his seat morgan with a decided effort controlled his indignation and also returned to his chair and then plunkett with the spring of a tiger leaped around the corner of the table and snapped handcuffs on the paralyzed morgan s wrists hound lover and woman killer he cried get ready to meet your god when bridger had finished i asked him did he get the right man he did said the consul and how did he know i inquired being in a kind of bewilderment when he put morgan in the dory answered bridger the next day to take him aboard the pajaro this man plunkett stopped to shake hands with me and i asked him the same question mr bridger said he i m a kentuckian and i ve seen a great deal of both men and animals and i never yet saw a man that was overfond of horses and dogs but what was cruel to women the hypotheses of failure lawyer gooch bestowed his undivided attention upon the engrossing arts of his profession but one flight of fancy did he allow his mind to entertain he was fond of likening his suite of office rooms to the bot tom of a ship the rooms were three in number with a door opening from one to another these doors could also be closed ships lawyer gooch would say are constructed for safety with separate water tight compartments in their bottoms if one compartment springs a leak it fills with water but the good ship goes on unhurt were it not for the separating bulkheads one leak would sink the vessel now it often happens that while i am occu pied with clients other clients with conflicting interests call with the assistance of archibald an office boy with a future i cause the dangerous influx to be diverted into separate compartments while i sound with my legal plummet the depth of each if neces sary they may be haled into the hallway and permitted to escape by way of the stairs which we may term the lee scuppers thus the good ship of business is kept afloat whereas if the element that supports her were allowed to mingle freely in her hold we might be swamped ha ha ha the law is dry good jokes are few surely it might be permitted lawyer gooch to mitigate the bore of briefs the tedium of torts and the prosiness of processes with even so light a levy upon the good property of humour lawyer gooch s practice leaned largely to the settle ment of marital infelicities did matrimony languish through complications he mediated soothed and arbi trated did it suffer from implications he readjusted defended and championed did it arrive at the extremity of duplications he always got light sentences for his clients but not always was lawyer gooch the keen armed wily belligerent ready with his two edged sword to lop off the shackles of hymen he had been known to build up instead of demolishing to reunite instead of severing to lead erring and foolish ones back into the fold instead of scattering the flock often had he by his eloquent and moving appeals sent husband and wife weeping back into each other s arms frequently he had coached childhood so successfully that at the psychological moment and at a given signal the plaintive pipe of papa won t you turn home adain to me and muvver had won the day and upheld the pillars of a tottering home unprejudiced persons admitted that lawyer gooch received as big fees from these revoked clients as would have been paid him had the cases been contested in court prejudiced ones intimated that his fees were doubled because the penitent couples always came back later for the divorce anyhow there came a season in june when the legal ship of lawyer gooch to borrow his own figure was nearly becalmed the divorce mill grinds slowly in june it is the month of cupid and hymen lawyer gooch then sat idle in the middle room of his clientless suite a small anteroom connected or rather separated this apartment from the hallway here was stationed archibald who wrested from visitors their cards or oral nomenclature which he bore to his master while they waited suddenly on this day there came a great knocking at the outermost door archibald opening it was thrust aside as superfluous by the visitor who without due reverence at once pene trated to the office of lawyer gooch and threw himself with good natured insolence into a comfortable chair facing that gentlemen you are phineas c gooch attorney at law said the visitor his tone of voice and inflection making his words at once a question an assertion and an accusation before committing himself by a reply the lawyer esti mated his possible client in one of his brief but shrewd and calculating glances the man was of the emphatic type large sized active bold and debonair in demeanour vain beyond a doubt slightly swaggering ready and at ease he was well clothed but with a shade too much ornateness he was seeking a lawyer but if that fact would seem to saddle him with troubles they were not patent in his beaming eye and courageous air my name is gooch at length the lawyer admitted upon pressure he would also have confessed to the phineas c but he did not consider it good practice to volunteer information i did not receive your card he continued by way of rebuke so i i know you didn t remarked the visitor coolly and you won t just yet light up he threw a leg over an arm of his chair and tossed a handful of rich hued cigars upon the table lawyer gooch knew the brand he thawed just enough to accept the invitation to smoke you are a divorce lawyer said the cardless visitor this time there was no interrogation in his voice nor did his words constitute a simple assertion they formed a charge a denunciation as one would say to a dog you are a dog lawyer gooch was silent under the imputation you handle continued the visitor all the various ramifications of busted up connubiality you are a surgeon we might saw who extracts cupid s darts when he shoots em into the wrong parties you furnish patent incandescent lights for premises where the torch of hymen has burned so low you can t light a cigar at it am i right mr gooch i have undertaken cases said the lawyer guardedly in the line to which your figurative speech seems to refer do you wish to consult me professionally mr the lawyer paused with significance not yet said the other with an arch wave of his cigar not just yet let us approach the subject with the caution that should have been used in the original act that makes this pow wow necessary there exists a matrimonial jumble to be straightened out but before i give you names i want your honest well anyhow your professional opinion on the merits of the mix up i want you to size up the catastrophe abstractly you understand i m mr nobody and i ve got a story to tell you then you say what s what do you get my wireless you want to state a hypothetical case suggested lawyer gooch that s the word i was after apothecary was the best shot i could make at it in my mind the hypo thetical goes i ll state the case suppose there s a woman a deuced fine looking woman who has run away from her husband and home she s badly mashed on another man who went to her town to work up some real estate business now we may as well call this woman s husband thomas r billings for that s his name i m giving you straight tips on the cognomens the lothario chap is henry k jessup the billingses lived in a little town called susanville a good many miles from here now jessup leaves susanville two weeks ago the next day mrs billings follows him she s dead gone on this man jessup you can bet your law library on that lawyer gooch s client said this with such unctuous satisfaction that even the callous lawyer experienced a slight ripple of repulsion he now saw clearly in his fatuous visitor the conceit of the lady killer the egoistic complacency of the successful trifler now continued the visitor suppose this mrs billings wasn t happy at home we ll say she and her husband didn t gee worth a cent they ve got incom patibility to burn the things she likes billings wouldn t have as a gift with trading stamps it s tabby and rover with them all the time she s an educated woman in science and culture and she reads things out loud at meetings billings is not on he don t appreciate pro gress and obelisks and ethics and things of that sort old billings is simply a blink when it comes to such things the lady is out and out above his class now lawyer don t it look like a fair equalization of rights and wrongs that a woman like that should be allowed to throw down billings and take the man that can appreciate her incompatibility said lawyer gooch is undoubt edly the source of much marital discord and unhappiness where it is positively proved divorce would seem to be the equitable remedy are you excuse me is this man jessup one to whom the lady may safely trust her future oh you can bet on jessup said the client with a confident wag of his head jessup s all right he ll do the square thing why he left susanville just to keep pwple from talking about mrs billings but she fol lowed him up and now of course he ll stick to her when she gets a divorce all legal and proper jessup the proper thing and now said lawyer gooch continuing the hypo if you prefer and supposing that my services should ired in the case what the client rose impulsively to his feet oh dang the hypothetical business he exclaimed impatiently let s let her drop and get down to straight talk you ought to know who i am by this time i want that woman to have her divorce i ll pay for it the day you set mrs billings free i ll pay you five hundred dollars lawyer gooch s client banged his fist upon the table to punctuate his generosity if that is the case began the lawyer lady to see you sir bawled archibald bouncing in from his anteroom he had orders to always announce immediately any client that might come there was no sense in turning business away lawyer gooch took client number one by the arm and led him suavely into one of the adjoining rooms favour me by remaining here a few minutes sir said he i will return and resume our consultation with the least possible delay i am rather expecting a visit from a very wealthy old lady in connection with a will i will not keep you waiting long the breezy gentleman seated himself with obliging acquiescence aud took up a magazine the lawyer returned to the middle office carefully closing behind him the connecting door show the lady in archibald he said to the office boy who was awaiting the order a tall lady of commanding presence and sternly hand some entered the room she wore robes robes not clothes ample and fluent in her eye could be per ceived the lambent flame of genius and soul in her hand was a green bag of the capacity of a bushel and an umbrella that also seemed to wear a robe ample and fluent she accepted a chair are you mr phineas c gooch the lawyer she asked in formal and unconciliatory tones i am answered lawyer gooch without circum locution he never circumlocuted when dealing with a woman women circumlocute time is wasted when both sides in debate employ the same tactics as a lawyer sir began the lady you may have acquired some knowledge of the human heart do you believe that the pusillanimous and petty conventions of our artificial social life should stand as an obstacle in the way of a noble and affectionate heart when it finds its true mate among the miserable and worthless wretches in the world that are called men madam said lawyer gooch in the tone that he used in curbing his female clients this is an office for conducting the practice of law i am a lawyer not a philosopher nor the editor of an answers to the lovelorn column of a newspaper i have other clients waiting i will ask you kindly to come to the point well you needn t get so stiff around the gills about it said the lady with a snap of her luminous eves and a startling gyration of her umbrella business is what i ve come for i want your opinion in the matter of a suit for divorce as the vulgar would call it but which is really only the readjustment of the false and ignoble con ditions that the short sihhted laws of man have interposed between a loving i beg your pardon madam interrupted lawyer gooch with some impatience for reminding you again that this is a law office perhaps mrs wilcox mrs wilcox is all right cut in the lady with a hint of asperity and so are tolstoi and mrs gertrude atherton and omar khayyam and mr edward bok i ve read em all i would like to discuss with you the divine right of the soul as opposed to the freedom destroy ing restrictions of a bigoted and narrow minded society but i will proceed to business i would prefer to lay the matter before you in an impersonal way until vou pass upon its merits that is to describe it as a sup posable instance without you wish to state a hypothetical case said lawyer gooch i was going to say that said the lady sharply now suppose there is a woman who is all soul and heart and aspirations for a complete existence this woman has a husband who is far below her in intellect in taste in everything bah he is a brute he despises literature he sneers at the lofty thoughts of the world s great thinkers he thinks only of real estate and such sordid things he is no mate for a woman with soul we will say that this unfortunate wife one day meets with her ideal a man with brain and heart and force she loves him although this man feels the thrill of a new found affinity he is too noble too honourable to declare himself he flies from the presence of his beloved she flies after him trampling with superb indifference upon the fetters with which an unenlightened social system would bind her now what will a divorce cost eliza ann timmins the poetess of sycamore gap got one for three hundred and forty dollars can i i mean can this lady i speak of get one that cheap madam said lawyer gooch your last two or three sentences delight me with their intelligence and clearness can we not now abandon the hypothetical and come down to names and business i should say so exclaimed the lady adopting the practical with admirable readiness thomas r bil lings is the name of the low brute who stands between the happiness of his legal his legal but not his spiri tual wife and henry k jessup the noble man whom nature intended for her mate i concluded the client with an air of dramatic revelation am mrs billings gentlemen to see you sir shouted archibald invad ing the room almost at a handspring lawyer gooch arose from his chair mrs billings he said courteously allow me to conduct you into the adjoining office apartment for a few minutes i am expecting a very wealthy old gentleman on busines connected with a will in a very short while i will join you and continue our consultation with his accustomed chivalrous manner lawyer gooch ushered his soulful client into the remaining unoccupied room and came out closing the door with circumspection the next visitor introduced by archibald was a thin nervous irritable looking man of middle age with a worried and apprehensive expression of countenance he carried in one hand a small satchel which he set down upon the floor beside the chair which the lawyer placed for him his clothing was of good quality but it was worn without regard to neatness or style and appeared to be covered with the dust of travel you make a specialty of divorce cases he said in an agitated but business like tone i may say began lawyer gooch that my prac tice has not altogether avoided i know you do interrupted client number three you needn t tell me i ve heard all about you i have a case to lay before you without necessarily disclosing any connection that i might have with it that is you wish said lawyer gooch to state a hvpo thetical case you may call it that i am a plain man of business i will be as brief as possible we will first take up hypothetical woman we will say she is married uncon genially in many ways she is a superior woman phys ically she is considered to be handsome she is devoted to what she calls literature poetry and prose and such stuff her husband is a plain man in the business walks of life their home has not been happy although the husband has tried to make it so some time ago a man a stranger came to the peaceful town in which they lived and engaged in some real estate operations this woman met him and became unaccountably infatu ated with him her attentions became so open that the man felt the community to be no safe place for him so he left it she abandoned husband and home and followed him she forsook her home where she was provided with every comfort to follow this man who had inspired her with such a strange affection is there any thing more to be deplored concluded the client in a trembling voice than the wrecking of a home by a woman s uncalculating folly lawyer gooch delivered the cautious opinion that there was not this man she has gone to join resumed the visitor is not the man to make her happy it is a wild and foolish self deception that makes her think he will her husband in spite of their many disagreements is the only one capable of dealing with her sensitive and peculiar nature but this she does not realize now would you consider a divorce the logical cure in the case you present asked lawyer gooch who felt that the conversation was wandering too far from the field of business a divorce exclaimed the client feelingly almost tearfully no no not that i have read mr gooch of many instances where your sympathy and kindly inter est led you to act as a mediator between estranged hus band and wife and brought them together again let us drop the hypothetical case i need conceal no longer that it is i who am the sufferer in this sad affair the names you shall have thomas r billings and wife and henry k jessup the man with whom she is infatuated client number three laid his hand upon mr gooch s arm deep emotion was written upon his careworn face for heaven s sake he said fervently help me in this hour of trouble seek out mrs billings and persuade her to abandon this distressing pursuit of her lamentable folly tell her mr gooch that her husband is willing to receive her back to his heart and home promise her anything that will induce her to return i have heard of your success in these matters mrs bil lings cannot be very far away i am worn out with travel and weariness twice during the pursuit i saw her but various circumstances prevented our having an inter view will you undertake this mission for me mr gooch and earn my everlasting gratitude it is true said lawver gooch frowning slightly at the other s last words but immediately calling up an expression of virtuous benevolence that on a number of occasions i have been successful in persuading couples who sought the severing of their matrimonial bonds to think better of their rash intentions and return to their homes reconciled but i assure you that the work is often exceedingly difficult the amount of argument perseverance and if i may be allowed to say it eloquence that it requires would astonish you but this is a case in which my sympathies would be wholly enlisted i feel deeply for you sir and i would be most happy to see husband and wife reunited but my time concluded the lawyer looking at his watch as if suddenly reminded of the fact is valuable i am aware of that said the client and if you will take the case and persuade mrs billings to return home and leave the man alone that she is following on that day i will pay you the sum of one thousand dollars i have made a little money in real estate during the recent boom in susanville and i will not begrudge that amount retain your seat for a few moments please said lawyer gooch arising and again consulting his watch i have another client waiting in an adjoining room whom i had very nearly forgotten i will return in the briefest possible space the situation was now one that fully satisfied lawyer gooch s love of intricacy and complication he revelled in cases that presented such subtle problems and possi bilities it pleased him to think that he was master of the happiness and fate of the three individuals who sat uncon cious of one another s presence within his reach his old figure of the ship glided into his mind but now the figure failed for to have filled every compartment of an actual vessel would have been to endanger her safety with his compartments full his ship of affairs could but sail on to the advantageous port of a fine fat fee the thing for him to do of course was to wring the best bargain he could from some one of his anxious cargo first he called to the office boy lock the outer door archibald and admit no one then he moved with long silent strides into the room in which client number one waited that gentleman sat patiently scanning the pictures in the magazine with a cigar in his mouth and his feet upon a table well he remarked cheerfully as the lawyer entered have you made up your mind does five hundred dollars go for getting the fair lady a divorce you mean that as a retainer asked lawyer gooch softly interrogative hey no for the whole job it s enough ain t it my fee said lawyer gooch would be one thousand five hundred dollars five hundred dollars down and the remainder upon issuance of the divorce a loud whistle came from client number one his feet descended to the floor guess we can t close the deal he said arising i cleaned up five hunderd dollars in a little real estate dicker down in susanville i d do anything i could to free the lady but it out sizes my pile could you stand one thousand two hundred dollars asked the lawyer insinuatingly five hundred is my limit i tell you guess i ll have to hunt up a cheaper lawyer the client put on his hat out this way please said lawyer gooch opening the door that led into the hallway as the gentleman flowed out of the compartment and down the stairs lawyer gooch smiled to himself exit mr jessup he murmured as he fingered the henry clay tuft of hair at his ear and now for the forsaken husband he returned to the middle office and assumed a businesslike manner i understand he said to client number three that you agree to pay one thousand dollars if i bring about or am instrumental in bringing about the return of mrs billings to her home and her abandonment of her infatu ated pursuit of the man for whom she has conceived such a violent fancy also that the case is now unreservedly in my hands on that basis is that correct entirely said the other eagerly and i can produce the cash any time at two hours notice lawyer gooch stood up at his full height his thin figure seemed to expand his thumbs sought the arm holes of his vest upon his face was a look of sym pathetic benignity that he always wore during such undertakings then sir he said in kindly tones i think i can promise you an early relief from your troubles i have that much confidence in my powers of argument and persuasion in the natural impulses of the human heart toward good and in the strong influence of a husband s unfaltering love mrs billinos sir is here in that room the lawyer s long arm pointed to the door i will call her in at once and our united pleadings lawyer gooch paused for client number three had leaped from his chair as if propelled by steel springs and clutched his satchel what the devil he exclaimed harshly do vou mean that woman in there i thought i shook her off forty miles back he ran to the open window looked out below and threw one leg over the sill stop cried lawyer gooch in amazement what would you do come mr billings and face your erring but innocent wife our combined entreaties cannot fail to billings shouted the now thoroughly moved client i ll billings you you old idiot turning he hurled his satchel with fury at the lawyer s head it struck that astounded peacemaker between the eyes causing him to stagger backward a pace or two when lawyer gooch recovered his wits he saw that his client had disappeared rushing to the window he leaned out and saw the recreant gathering himself up from the top of a shed upon which he had dropped from the second story window without stopping to collect his hat he then plunged downward the remaining ten feet to the alley up which he flew with prodigious celerity until the surrounding building swallowed him up from view lawyer gooch passed his hand tremblingly across his brow it was a habitual act with him serving to clear his thoughts perhaps also it now seemed to soothe the spot where a very hard alligator hide satchel had struck the satchel lay upon the floor wide open with its con tents spilled about mechanically lawyer gooch stooped to gather up the articles the first was a collar and the omniscient eye of the man of law perceived wonder ingly the initials h k j marked upon it then came a comb a brush a folded map and a piece of soap lastly a handful of old business letters addressed every one of them to henry k jessup esq lawyer gooch closed the satchel and set it upon the table he hesitated for a moment and then put on his hat and walked into the office boy s anteroom archibald he said mildly as he opened the hall door i am going around to the supreme court rooms in five minutes you may step into the inner office and inform the lady who is waiting there that here lawyer gooch made use of the vernacular that there s nothing doing calloway s code the new york enterprise sent h b calloway as special correspondent to the russo japanese portsmouth war for two months calloway hung about yokohama and tokio shaking dice with the other correspondents for drinks of rickshaws oh no that s something to ride in anyhow he wasn t earning the salary that his paper was paying him but that was not calloway s fault the little brown men who held the strings of fate between their fingers were not ready for the readers of the enterprise to season their breakfast bacon and eggs with the battles of the descendants of the gods but soon the column of correspondents that were to go out with the first army tightened their field glass belts and went down to the yalu with kuroki calloway was one of these now this is no history of the battle of the yalu river that has been told in detail by the correspondents who gazed at the shrapnel smoke rings from a distance of three miles but for justice s sake let it be understood that the japanese commander prohibited a nearer view calloway s feat was accomplished before the battle what he did was to furnish the enterprise with the biggest beat of the war that paper published exclu sively and in detail the news of the attack on the lines of the russian general on the same day that it was made no other paper printed a word about it for two days afterward except a london paper whose account was absolutely incorrect and untrue calloway did this in face of the fact that general kuroki was making his moves and living his plans with the pro foundest secrecy as far as the world outside his camps was concerned the correspondents were forbidden to send out any news whatever of his plans and every message that was allowed on the wires was censored with rigid severity the correspondent for the london paper handed in a cablegram describing kuroki s plans but as it was wrong from beginning to end the censor grinned and let it go through so there they were kuroki on one side of the yalu with forty two thousand infantry five thousand cavalry and one hundred and twenty four guns on the other side zassulitch waited for him with only twenty three thousand men and with a long stretch of river to guard and calloway had got hold of some important inside information that he knew would bring the enterprise staff around a cablegram as thick as flies around a park row lemonade stand if he could only get that message past the censor the new censor who had arrived and taken his post that day calloway did the obviously proper thing he lit his pipe and sat down on a gun carriage to think it over and there we must leave him for the rest of the story belongs to vesey a sixteen dollar a week reporter on the enterprise calloway s cablegram was handed to the managing editor at four o clock in the afternoon he read it three times and then drew a pocket mirror from a pigeon hole in his desk and looked at his reflection carefully then he went over to the desk of boyd his assistant he usually called boyd when he wanted him and laid the cablegram before him it s from calloway he said see what you make of it the message was dated at wi ju and these were the words of it foregone preconcerted rash witching goes muffled rumour mine dark silent unfortunate richmond existing great hotly brute select mooted parlous beggars ye angel incontrovertible boyd read it twice it s either a cipher or a sunstroke said he ever hear of anything like a code in the office a secret code asked the m e who had held his desk for only two years managing editors come and go none except the vernacular that the lady specials write in said boyd couldn t be an acrostic could it i thought of that said the m e but the beginning letters contain only four vowels it must be a code of some sort try em in groups suggested boyd let s see rash witching goes not with me it doesn t muf fled rumour mine must have an underground wire dark silent unfortunate richmond no reason why he should knock that town so hard existing great hotly no it doesn t pan out i ll call scott the city editor came in a hurry and tried his luck a city editor must know something about everything so scott knew a little about cipher writing it may be what is called an inverted alphabet cipher said he i ll try that r seems to be the oftenest used initial letter with the exception of m assuming r to mean e the most frequently used vowel we transpose the letters so scott worked rapidly with his pencil for two minutes and then showed the first word according to his reading the word scejtzez great cried boyd it s a charade my first is a russian general go on scott no that won t work said the city editor it s undoubtedly a code it s impossible to read it without the key has the office ever used a cipher code just what i was asking said the m e hustle everybody up that ought to know we must get at it some way calloway has evidently got hold of some thing big and the censor has put the screws on or he wouldn t have cabled in a lot of chop suey like this throughout the office of the enterprise a dragnet was sent hauling in such members of the staff as would be likely to know of a code past or present by reason of their wisdom information natural intelligence or length of servitude they got together in a group in the city room with the m e in the centre no one had heard of a code all began to explain to the head investi gator that newspapers never use a code anyhow that is a cipher code of course the associated press stuff is a sort of code an abbreviation rather but the m e knew all that and said so he asked each man how long he had worked on the paper not one of them had drawn pay from an enterprise envelope for longer than six years calloway had been on the paper twelve years try old heffelbauer said the m e he was here when park row was a potato patch heffelbauer was an institution he was half janitor half handy man about the office and half watchman thus becoming the peer of thirteen and one half tailors sent for he came radiating his nationality heffelbauer said the m e did you ever hear of a code belonging to the office a long time ago a private code you know what a code is don t you yah said heffelbauer sure i know vat a code is yah apout dwelf or fifteen year ago der office had a code der reborters in der city room haf it here ah said the m e we re getting on the trail now where was it kept heffelbauer what do you know about it somedimes said the retainer dey keep it in der little room behind der library room can you find it asked the m e eagerly do you know where it is mein gott said heffelbauer how long you dink a code live der reborters call him a maskeet but von day he butt mit his head der editor und oh he s talking about a goat said boyd get out heffelbauer again discomfited the concerted wit and resource of the enterprise huddled around calloway s puzzle con sidering its mysterious words in vain then vesey came in vesey was the youngest reporter he had a thirty two inch chest and wore a number fourteen collar but his bright scotch plaid suit gave him presence and con ferred no obscurity upon his whereabouts he wore his hat in such a position that people followed him about to see him take it off convinced that it must be hung upon a peg driven into the back of his head he was never without an immense knotted hard wood cane with a german silver tip on its crooked handle vesey was the best photograph hustler in the office scott said it was because no living human being could resist the per sonal triumph it was to hand his picture over to vesey vesey always wrote his own news stories except the big ones which were sent to the rewrite men add to this fact that among all the inhabitants temples and groves of the earth nothing existed that could abash vesey and his dim sketch is concluded vesey butted into the circle of cipher readers very much as heffelbauer s code would have done and asked what was up some one explained with the touch of half familiar condescension that they always used toward him vesey reached out and took the cablegram from the m e s hand under the protection of some special providence he was always doing appalling things like that and coming off unscathed it s a code said vesey anybody got the key the office has no code said boyd reaching for the message vesey held to it then old callowav expects us to read it anyhow said he he s up a tree or something and he s made this up so as to get it by the censor it s up to us gee i wish they had sell me too say we can t afford to fall down on our end of it foregone preconcerted rash witching h m vesey sat down on a table corner and began to whistle softly frowning at the cablegram let s have it please said the m e we ve got to get to work on it i believe i ve got a line on it said vesey give me ten minutes he walked to his desk threw his hat into a waste basket spread out flat on his chest like a gorgeous lizard and started his pencil going the wit and wisdom of the enterprise remained in a loose group and smiled at one another nodding their heads toward vesey then they began to exchange their theories about the cipher it took vesey exactly fifteen minutes he brought to the m e a pad with the code key written on it i felt the swing of it as soon as i saw it said vesey hurrah for old calloway he s done the japs and every paper in town that prints literature instead of news take a look at that thus had vesey set forth the reading of the code foregone conclusion preconcerted arrangement rash act witching hour of midnight goes without saying muffled report rumour hath it mine host dark horse silent majority unfortunate pedestrians richmond in the field existing conditions great white way hotly contested brute force select few mooted question parlous times beggars description ye correspondent angel unawares incontrovertible fact mr vesey afterward explained that the logical journalistic complement of the word unfortunate was once the word victim but since the automobile became so popular the correct following word is now pedestrians of course in calloway s code it meant infantry it s simply newspaper english explained vesey i ve been reporting on the enterprise long enough to know it by heart old calloway gives us the cue word and we use the word that naturally follows it just as we em in the paper read it over and you ll see how pat they drop into their places now here s the message he intended us to get vesey handed out another sheet of paper concluded arrangement to act at hour of midnight without saying report hath it that a large body of cavalry and an overwhelming force of infantry will be thrown into the field conditions white way con tested by only a small force question the times description its correspondent is unaware of the facts great stuff cried boyd excitedly kuroki crosses the yalu to night and attacks oh we won t do a thing to the sheets that make up with addison s essays real estate transfers and bowling scores mr vesey said the m e with his jollying which you should regard as a favour manner you have cast a serious reflection upon the literary standards of the paper that employs you you have also assisted materially in giving us the biggest beat of the year i will let you know in a day or two whether you are to be discharged or retained at a larger salary somebody send ames to me ames was the king pin the snowy petalled marguerite the star bright looloo of the rewrite men he saw attempted murder in the pains of green apple colic cyclones in the summer zephyr lost children in every top spinning urchin an uprising of the down trodden masses in every hurling of a derelict potato at a passing automobile when not rewriting ames sat on the porch of his brooklyn villa playing checkers with his ten year old son ames and the war editor shut themselves in a room there was a map in there stuck full of little pins that represented armies and divisions their fingers had been itching for days to move those pins along the crooked line of the yalu they did so now and in words of fire ames translated calloway s brief message into a front page masterpiece that set the world talking he told of the secret councils of the japanese officers gave kuroki s flaming speeches in full counted the cavalry and infantry to a man and a horse described the quick and silent building of the bridge at stuikauchen across which the mikado s legions were hurled upon the surprised zassulitch whose troops were widely scattered along the river and the battle well you know what ames can do with a battle if you give him just one smell of smoke for a foundation and in the same story with seemingly supernatural knowledge he gleefully scored the most profound and ponderous paper in england for the false and misleading account of the intended movements of the japanese first army printed in its issue of the same date only one error was made and that was the fault of the cable operator at wi ju calloway pointed it out after he came back the word great in his code should have been gage and its complemental words of battle but it went to ames conditions white and of course he took that to mean snow his description of the japanese army strum struggling through the snowstorm blinded by the whirling flakes was thrillingly vivid the artists turned out some effective illustrations that made a hit as pictures of the artillery dragging their guns through the drifts but as the attack was made on the first day of may conditions white excited some amusement but it in made no difference to the enterprise anyway it was wonderful and calloway was wonderful in having made the new censor believe that his jargon of words meant no more than a complaint of the dearth of news and a petition for more expense money and vesey was wonderful and most wonderful of all are words and how they make friends one with another being oft associated until not even obituary notices them do part on the second day following the city editor halted at vesey s desk where the reporter was writing the story of a man who had broken his leg by falling into a coal hole ames having failed to find a murder motive in it the old man says your salary is to be raised to twenty a week said scott all right said vesey every little helps say mr scott which would you say we can state without fear of successful contradiction or on the whole it can be safely asserted a matter of mean elevation one winter the alcazar opera company of new orleans made a speculative trip along the mexican central american and south american coasts the venture proved a most successful one the music loving impressionable spanish americans deluged the company with dollars and vivas the manager waxed plump and amiable but for the prohibitive climate he would have put forth the distinctive flower of his prosperity the overcoat of fur braided frogged and opulent almost was he persuaded to raise the salaries of his company but with a mighty effort he conquered the impulse toward such an unprofitable effervescence of joy at macuto on the coast of venezuela the company scored its greatest success imagine coney island translated into spanish and you will comprehend macuto the fashionable season is from november to march down from la guayra and caracas and valencia and other interior towns flock the people for their holiday sea son there are bathing and fiestas and bull fights and scandal and then the people have a passion for music that the bands in the plaza and on the sea beach stir but do not satisfy the coming of the alcazar opera com pany aroused the utmost ardour and zeal among the pleasure seekers the illustrious guzman blanco president and dic tator of venezuela sojourned in macuto with his court for the season that potent ruler who himself paid a subsidy of pesos each year to grand opera in caracas ordered one of the government warehouses to be cleared for a temporary theatre a stage was quickly constructed and rough wooden benches made for the audience private boxes were added for the use of the president and the notables of the army and government the company remained in macuto for two weeks each performance filled the house as closely as it could be packed then the music mad people fought for room in the open doors and windows and crowded about hundreds deep on the outside those audiences formed a brilliantly diversified patch of colour the hue of their faces ranged from the clear olive of the pure blood span iards down through the yellow and brown shades of the mestizos to the coal black carib and the jamaica negro scattered among them were little groups of indians with faces like stone idols wrapped in gaudy fibre woven blankets indians down from the mountain states of zamora and los andes and miranda to trade their gold dust in the coast towns the spell cast upon these denizens of the interior fastnesses was remarkable they sat in petrified ecstasy conspicuous among the excitable macutians who wildly strove with tongue and hand to give evidence of their delight only once did the sombre rapture of these aboriginals find expression during the rendition of faust guzman blanco extravagantly pleased by the jewel song cast upon the stage a purse of gold pieces other distinguished citizens followed his lead to the extent of whatever loose coin they had convenient while some of the fair and fashionable se oras were moved in imita tion to fling a jewel or a ring or two at the feet of the marguerite who was according to the bills mlle nina giraud then from different parts of the house rose sundry of the stolid hillmen and cast upon the stage little brown and dun bags that fell with soft thumps and did not rebound it was no doubt pleasure at the tribute to her art that caused mlle giraud s eyes to shine so brightly when she opened these little deerskin bags in her dressing room and found them to contain pure gold dust if so the pleasure was rightly hers for her voice in song pure strong and thrilling with the feeling of the emotional artist deserved the tribute that it earned but the triumph of the alcazar opera company is not the theme it but leans upon and colours it there happened in macuto a tragic thing an unsolvable mystery that sobered for a time the gaiety of the happy season one evening between the short twilight and the time when she should have whirled upon the stage in the red and black of the ardent carmen mlle nina giraud dis appeared from the sight and ken of pairs of eyes and as many minds in macuto there was the usual turmoil and hurrying to seek her messengers flew to the little french kept hotel where she stayed others of the company hastened here or there where she might be lingering in some tienda or unduly prolonging her bath upon the beach all search was fruitless mademoi selle had vanished half an hour passed and she did not appear the dictator unused to the caprices of prime donne became impatient he sent an aide from his box to say to the manager that if the curtain did not at once rise he would immediately hale the entire company to the calabosa though it would desolate his heart indeed to be com pelled to such an act birds in macuto could be made to sing the manager abandoned hope for the time of mlle giraud a member of the chorus who had dreamed hopelessly for years of the blessed opportunity quickly carmenized herself and the opera went on afterward when the lost cantatrice appeared not the aid of the authorities was invoked the president at once set the army the police and all citizens to the search not one clue to mlle giraud s disappearance was found the alcazar left to fill engagements farther down the coast on the way back the steamer stopped at macuto and the manager made anxious inquiry not a trace of the lady had been discovered the alcazar could do no more the personal belongings of the missing lady were stored in the hotel against her possible later reappearance and the opera company continued upon its homeward voyage to new orleans on the camino real along the beach the two saddle mules and the four pack mules of don se or johnny armstrong stood patiently awaiting the crack of the whip of the arriero luis that would be the signal for the start on another long journey into the mountains the pack mules were loaded with a varied assortment of hard ware and cutlery these articles don johnny traded to the interior indians for the gold dust that they washed from the andean streams and stored in

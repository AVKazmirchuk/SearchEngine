or was it a range it s hot enough no there s no news to tell i believe said goodwin with a mischievous look in his eye except that old geddie is getting grumpier and crosser every day if something doesn t happen to relieve his mind i ll have to quit smoking on his back porch and there s no other place available that is cool enough he isn t grumpy said paula brannigan impulsively when he but she ceased suddenly and drew back with a deepening color for her mother had been a mestizo lady and the spanish blood had brought to paula a certain shyness that was an adornment to the other half of her demonstrative nature ii the lotus and the bottle willard greddie consul for the united states in coralio was working leisurely on his yearly report goodwin who had strolled in as he did daily for a smoke on the much coveted porch had found him so absorbed in his work that he departed after roundly abusing the consul for his lack of hospitality i shall complain to the civil service department said goodwin or is it a department perhaps it s only a theory one gets neither civility nor service from you you won t talk and you won t set out anything to drink what kind of a way is that of representing your government goodwin strolled out and across to the hotel to see if he could bully the quarantine doctor into a game on coralio s solitary billiard table his plans were completed for the interception of the fugitives from the capital and now it was but a waiting game that he had to play the consul was interested in his report he was only twenty four and he had not been in coralio long enough for his enthusiasm to cool in the heat of the tropics a paradox that may be allowed between cancer and capricorn so many thousand bunches of bananas so mnay thousand oranges and coconuts so many ounces of gold dust pounds of rubber coffee indigo and sarparilla actually exports were twenty per cent greater than for the previous year a little thrill of satisfaction ran through the consul perhaps he thought the state department upon reading his introduction would notice and then he leaned back in his chair and laughed he was getting as bad as the others for the moment he had forgotten that coralio was an insignificant republic lying along the by ways of a second rate sea he thought of gregg the quarantine doctor who subscribed for the london lancet expecting to find it quoting his reports to the home board of health concerning the yellow fever germ the consul knew that not one in fifty of his acquaintances in the states had ever heard of coralio he knew that two men at any rate would have to read his report some underling in the state department and a compositor in the public printing office perhaps the typesticker would note the increase of commerce in coralio and speak of it over the cheese and beer to a friend he had just written most unaccountable is the supineness of the large exporters in the united states in permitting the french and german houses to practically control the trade interests of this rich and productive country when he heard the hoarse notes of a steamer s siren geddie laid down his pen and gathered his panama hat and umbrella by the sound he knew it to be the valhalla one of the line of fruit vessels plying for the vesuvius company down to ninos of five years every one in coralio could name you each incoming steamer by the note of her siren the consul sauntered by a roundabout shaded way to the beach by reason of long practice he gauged his stroll so accurately that by the time he arrived on the sandy shore the boat of the customs officials was rowing back from the steamer which had been boarded and inspected according to the laws of anchuria there is no harbor at coralio vessels of the draught of the valhalla must ride at anchor a mile from shore when they take on fruit it is conveyed on lighters and freighter sloops at solitas where there was a fine harbor ships of many kinds were to be seen but in the roadstead off coralio scarcely any save the fruiters paused now and then a tramp coaster or a mysterious brig from spain and then a tramp coaster or a mysterious brig from spain or a saucy french barque would hang innocently for a few days in the offing then the custom house crew would become doubly vigilant and wary at night a sloop or two would be making strange trips in and out along the shore and in the morning the stock of three star hennessey wines and drygoods in coralio would be found vastly increased it has also been said that the customs officials jingled more silver in the pockets of their red striped trousers and that the record books showed no increase in import duties received the custom s boat and the valhalla gig reached the shore at the same time when they grounded in the shallow water there was still five yards of rolling surf between them and dry sand then half clothed caribs dashed into the water and brought in on their backs the valhalla s purser and the little native officials in their cotton undershirts blue trousers with red stripes and flapping straw hats at college geddie had been a treasure as a first baseman he now closed his umbrella stuck it upright in the sand and stooped with his hands resting upon his knees the purser burlesquing the pitcher s contortions hurled at the consul the heavy roll of newspapers tied with a string that the steamer always

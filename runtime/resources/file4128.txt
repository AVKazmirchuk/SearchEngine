and then we set forth in pursuit of the elusive tincture of affairs as we came out of the club there stood two men on the sidewalk near the steps in earnest conversation and by what process of ratiocination said one of them do you arrive at the conclusion that the division of society into producing and non possessing classes predicates failure when compared with competitive systems that are monopolizing in tendency and result inimically to industrial evolution oh come off your perch said the other man who wore glasses your premises won t come out in the wash you wind jammers who apply bandy legged theories to concrete categorical syllogisms send logical conclusions skallybootin into the infinitesimal ragbag you can t pull my leg with an old sophism with whiskers on it you quote marx and hyndman and kautsky what are they shines tolstoi his garret is full of rats i put it to you over the home plate that the idea of a cooperative commonwealth and an abolishment of competitive systems simply takes the rag off the bush and gives me hyperesthesia of the roopteetoop the skoo kum house for yours i stopped a few yards away and took out my little notebook oh come ahead said rivington somewhat ner vously you don t want to listen to that why man i whispered this is just what i do want to hear these slang types are among your city s most distinguishing features is this the bowery variety i really must hear more of it if i follow you said the man who had spoken flrst you do not believe it possible to reorganize society on the basis of common interest shinny on your own side said the man with glasses you never heard any such music from my foghorn what i said was that i did not believe it practicable just now the guys with wads are not in the frame of mind to slack up on the mazuma and the man with the portable tin banqueting canister isn t exactly ready to join the bible class you can bet your variegated socks that the situation is all spifflicated up from the battery to breakfast what the country needs is for some bully old bloke like cobden or some wise guy like old ben frank lin to sashay up to the front and biff the nigger s head with the baseball do you catch my smoke what rivington pulled me by the arm impatiently please come on he said let s go see something this isn t what you want indeed it is i said resisting this tough talk is the very stuff that counts there is a picturesqueness about the speech of the lower order of people that is quite unique did you say that this is the bowery variety of slang oh well said rivington giving it up i ll tell you straight that s one of our college professors talking he ran down for a day or two at the club it s a sort of fad with him lately to use slang in his conversation he thinks it improves language the man he is talking to is one of new york s famous social economists now will you come on you can t use that you know no i agreed i can t use that would you call that typical of new york of course not said rivington with a sigh of relief i m glad you see the difference but if you want to hear the real old tough bowery slang i ll take you down where you ll get your fill of it i would like it i said that is if it s the real thing i ve often read it in books but i never heard it do you think it will be dangerous to go unprotected among those characters oh no said rivington not at this time of night to tell the truth i haven t been along the bowery in a long time but i know it as well as i do broadway we ll look up some of the typical bowery boys and get them to talk it ll be worth your while they talk a peculiar dialect that you won t hear any where else on earth rivington and i went east in a forty second street car and then south on the third avenue line at houston street we got off and walked we are now on the famous bowery said rivington the bowery celebrated in song and story we passed block after block of gents furnishing stores the windows full of shirts with prices attached and cuffs inside in other windows were neckties and no shirts people walked up and down the sidewalks in some ways said i this reminds me of koko mono ind during the peach crating season rivington was nettled step into one of these saloons or vaudeville shows said he with a large roll of money and see how quickly the bowery will sustain its reputation you make impossible conditions said i coldly by and by rivington stopped and said we were in the heart of the bowery there was a policeman on the corner whom rivington knew hallo donahue said my guide how goes it my friend and i are down this way looking up a bit of local colour he s anxious to meet one of the bowery types can t you put us on to something genuine in that line something that s got the colour you know policeman donahue turned himself about ponder ously his florid face full of good nature he pointed with his club down the street sure he said huskily here comes a lad now that was born on the bowery and knows every inch of it if he s ever been above bleecker street he s kept it to himself a man about twenty eight or twenty nine with a smooth face was sauntering toward us with his hands in his coat pockets policeman donahue stopped him with a courteous wave of his club evening kerry he said here s a couple of gents friends of mine that want to hear you spiel something about the bowery can you reel em off a few yards certainly donahue said the young man pleas antly good evening gentlemen he said to us with a pleasant smile donahue walked off on his beat this is the goods whispered rivington nudging me with his elbow look at his jaw say cull said rivington pushing back his hat wot s doin me and my friend s taking a look down de old line see de copper tipped us off dat you was wise to de bowery is dat right i could not help admiring rivington s power of adapt ing himself to his surroundings donahue was right said the young man frankly i was brought up on the bowery i have been news boy teamster pugilist member of an organized band of toughs bartender and a sport in various mean ings of the word the experience certainly warrants the supposition that i have at least a passing acquaintance with a few phases of bowery life i will be pleased to place whatever knowledge and experience i have at the service of my friend donahue s friends rivington seemed ill at ease i say he said somewhat entreatingly i thought you re not stringing us are you it isn t just the kind of talk we expected you haven t even said hully gee once do you really belong on the bowery i am afraid said the bowery boy smilingly that at some time you have been enticed into one of the dives of literature and had the counterfeit coin of the bowery passed upon you the argot to which you doubtless refer was the invention of certain of your literary dis coverers who invaded the unknown wilds below third avenue and put strange sounds into the mouths of the inhabitants safe in their homes far to the north and west the credulous readers who were beguiled by this new dialect perused and believed like marco polo and mungo park pioneers indeed but ambitious souls who could not draw the line of demarcation between dis covery and invention the literary bones of these explorers are dotting the trackless wastes of the sub way while it is true that after the publication of the mythical language attributed to the dwellers along the bowery certain of its pat phrases and apt metaphors were adopted and to a limited extent used in this locality it was because our people are prompt in assimilating whatever is to their commercial advantage to the tourists who visited our newly discovered clime and who expected a realization of their literary guide books they supplied the demands of the market but perhaps i am wandering from the question in what way can i assist you gentlemen i beg you will believe that the hospitality of the street is extended to all there are i regret to say many catchpenny places of entertainment but i cannot conceive that they would entice you i felt rivington lean somewhat heavily against me say he remarked with uncertain utterance come and have a drink with us thank you but i never drink i find that alcohol even in the smallest quantities alters the perspective and i must preserve my perspective for i am studyinc the bowery i have lived in it nearly thirty years and i am just beginning to understand its heartbeats it is like a great river fed by a hundred alien streams each influx brings strange seeds on its flood strange silt and weeds and now and then a flower of rare promise to construe this river requires a man who can build dykes against the overflow who is a naturalist a geologist a humanitarian a diver and a strong swimmer i love my bowery it was my cradle and is my inspiration i have published one book the critics have been kind i put my heart in it i am writing another into which i hope to put both heart and brain consider me your guide gentlemen is there arything i can take you to see any place to which i can conduct you i was afraid to look at rivington except with one eye thanks said rivington we were looking up that is my friend confound it it s against all precedent you know awfully obliged just the same in case said our friend you would like to meet some of our bowery young men i would be pleased to have you visit the quarters of our east side kappa delta phi society only two blocks east of here awfully sorry said rivington but my friend s got me on the jump to nioht he s a terror when he s out after local colour now there s nothing i would like better than to drop in at the kappa delta phi but some other time we said our farewells and boarded a home bound car we had a rabbit on upper broadway and then i parted with rivington on a street corner well anyhow said he braced and recovered it couldn t have happened anywhere but in little old new york which to say the least was typical of rivington georgia s ruling if you should chance to visit the general land office step into the draughtsmen s room and ask to be shown the map of salado county a leisurely german pos sibly old kampfer himself will bring it to you it will be four feet square on heavy drawing cloth the lettering and the figures will be beautifully clear and distinct the title will be in splendid undecipherable german text ornamented with classic teutonic designs very likely ceres or pomona leaning against the initial letters with cornucopias venting grapes and wieners you must tell him that this is not the map you wish to see that he will kindly bring you its official predecessor he will then say ach so and bring out a map half the size of the first dim old tattered and faded by looking carefully near its northwest corner you will presently come upon the worn contours of chiquito river and maybe if your eyes are good discern the silent witness to this story the commissioner of the land office was of the old style his antique courtesy was too formal for his day he dressed in fine black and there was a suggestion of roman drapery in his long coat skirts his collars were undetached blame haberdashery for the word his tie was a narrow funereal strip tied in the same knot as were his shoe strings his gray hair was a trifle too long behind but he kept it smooth and orderly his face was clean shaven like the old statesmen s most people thought it a stern face but when its official expression was off a few had seen altogether a different countenance especially tender and gentle it had appeared to those who were about him during the last illness of his only child the commissioner had been a widower for years and his life outside his official duties had been so devoted to little georgia that people spoke of it as a touching and admirable thing he was a reserved man and dignified almost to austerity but the child had come below it all and rested upon his very heart so that she scarcely missed the mother s love that had been taken away there was a wonderful companionship between them for she had many of his own ways being thoughtful and serious beyond her years one day while she was lying with the fever burning brightly in her checks she said suddenly papa i wish i could do something good for a whole lot of children what would you like to do dear asked the com missioner give them a party oh i don t mean those kind i mean poor children who haven t homes and aren t loved and cared for as i am i tell you what papa what my own child if i shouldn t get well i ll leave them you not give you but just lend you for you must come to mamma and me when you die too if you can find time wouldn t you do something to help them if i ask you papa hush hush dear dear child said the commissioner holding her hot little hand against his cheek you ll get well real soon and you and i will see what we can do for them together but in whatsoever paths of benevolence thus vaguely premeditated the commissioner might tread he was not to have the company of his beloved that night the little frail body grew suddenly too tired to struggle further and georgia s exit was made from the great stage when she had scarcely begun to speak her little piece before the footlights but there must be a stage manager who understands she had given the cue to the one who was to speak after her a week after she was laid away the commissioner reappeared at the office a little more courteous a little paler and sterner with the black frock coat hanging a little more loosely from his tall figure his desk was piled with work that had accumulated during the four heartbreaking weeks of his absence his chief clerk had done what he could but there were ques tions of law of fine judicial decisions to be made concern ing the issue of patents the marketing and leasing of school lands the classification into grazing agricultural watered and timbered of new tracts to be opened to settlers the commissioner went to work silently and ob stinately putting back his grief as far as possible forcing his mind to attack the complicated and important busi ness of his office on the second day after his return he called the porter pointed to a leather covered chair that stood near his own and ordered it removed to a lumber room at the top of the building in that chair georgia would always sit when she came to the office for him of afternoons as time passed the commissioner seemed to grow more silent solitary and reserved a new phase of mind developed in him he could not endure the presence of a child often when a clattering youngster belonging to one of the clerks would come chattering into the big business room adjoining his little apartment the com missioner would steal softly and close the door he would always cross the street to avoid meeting the school children when they came dancing along in happy groups upon the sidewalk and his firm mouth would close into a mere line it was nearly three months after the rains had washed the last dead flower petals from the mound above little georgia when the land shark firm of hamlin and avery filed papers upon what they considered the fattest vacancy of the year it should not be supposed that all who were termed land sharks deserved the name many of them were reputable men of good business character some of them could walk into the most august councils of the state and say gentlemen we would like to have this and that and matters go thus but next to a three years drought and the boll worm the actual settler hated the land shark the land shark haunted the land office where all the land records were kept and hunted vacancies that is tracts of unappro priated public domain generally invisible upon the official maps but actually existing upon the ground the law entitled any one possessing certain state scrip to file by virtue of same upon any land not previously legally appropriated most of the scrip was now in the hands of the land sharks thus at the cost of a few hundred dollars they often secured lands worth as many thousands naturally the search for vacancies was lively but often very often the land they thus secured though legally unappropriated would be occupied by happy and contented settlers who had laboured for years to build up their homes only to discover that their titles were worthless and to receive peremptory notice to quit thus came about the bitter and not unjustifiable hatred felt by the toiling settlers toward the shrewd and seldom merciful speculators who so often turned them forth destitute and homeless from their fruitless labours the history of the state teems with their antagonism mr land shark seldom showed his face on locations from which he should have to eject the unfortunate victims of a monstrously tangled land system but let his emis saxies do the work there was lead in every cabin moulded into balls for him many of his brothers had enriched the grass with their blood the fault of it all lay far back when the state was young she felt the need of attract ing newcomers and of rewarding those pioneers already within her borders year after year she issued land scrip headrights bounties veteran donations confeder ates and to railroads irrigation companies colonies and tillers of the soil galore all required of the grantee was that he or it should have the scrip properly surveyed upon the public domain by the county or district surveyor and the land thus appropriated became the property of him or it or his or its heirs and assigns forever in those days and here is where the trouble began the state s domain was practically inexhaustible and the old surveyors with princely yea even western american liberality gave good measure and over flowing often the jovial man of metes and bounds would dispense altogether with the tripod and chain mounted on a pony that could cover something near a vara at a step with a pocket compass to direct his course he would trot out a survey by counting the beat of his pony s hoofs mark his corners and write out his field notes with the complacency produced by an act of duty well performed sometimes and who could blame the surveyor when the pony was feeling his oats he might step a little higher and farther and in that case the beneficiary of the scrip might get a thousand or two more acres in his survey than the scrip called for but look at the boundless leagues the state had to spare however no one ever had to complain of the pony under stepping nearly every old survey in the state con tained an excess of land in later years when the state became more populous and land values increased this careless work entailed incalculable trouble endless litigation a period of riotous land grabbing and no little bloodshed the land sharks voraciously attacked these excesses in the old surveys and filed upon such portions with new scrip as unappropriated public domain wherever the identi fications of the old tracts were vague and the corners were not to be clearly established the land office would recognize the newer locations as valid and issue title to the locators here was the greatest hardship to be found these old surveys taken from the pick of the land were already nearly all occupied by unsuspecting and peaceful settlers and thus their titles were demolished and the choice was placed before them either to buy their land over at a double price or to vacate it with their families and personal belongings immediately land locators sprang up by hundreds the country was held up and searched for vacancies at the point of a compass hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of splendid acres were wrested from their innocent purchasers and holders there began a vast hegira of evicted settlers in tattered wagons going nowhere cursing injustice stunned purposeless homeless hopeless their children began to look up to them for bread and cry it was in consequence of these conditions that hamil ton and avery had filed upon a strip of land about a mile wide and three miles long comprising about two thou sand acres it being the excess over complement of the elias denny three league survey on chiquito river in one of the middle western counties this two thousand acre body of land was asserted by them to be vacant land and improperly considered a part of the denny survey they based this assertion and their claim upon the land upon the demonstrated facts that the beginning corner of the denny survey was plainly identified that its field notes called to run west varas and then called for chiquito river thence it ran south with the meanders and so on and that the chiquito river was on the ground fully a mile farther west from the point reached by course and distance to sum up there were two thousand acres of vacant land between the denny survey proper and chiquito river one sweltering day in july the commissioner called for the papers in connection with this new location they were brought and heaped a foot deep upon his desk field notes statements sketches affidavits connecting lines documents of every description that shrewdness and money could call to the aid of hamlin and avery the firm was pressing the commissioner to issue a patent upon their location they possesed inside infor mation concerning a new railroad that would probably pass somewhere near this land the general land office was very still while the com missioner was delving into the heart of the mass of evi dence the pigeons could be heard on the roof of the old castle like building cooing and fretting the clerks were droning everywhere scarcely pretending to earn their salaries each little sound echoed hollow and loud from the bare stone flagged floors the plastered walls and the iron joisted ceiling the impalpable perpetual lime stone dust that never settled whitened a long streamer of sunlight that pierced the tattered window awning it seemed that hamlin and avery had builded well the denny survey was carelessly made even for a care less period its beginning corner was identical with that of a well defined old spanish grant but its other calls were sinfully vague the field notes contained no other object that survived no tree no natural object save chiquito river and it was a mile wrong there according to precedent the office would be justified in giving it its complement by course and distance and considering the remainder vacant instead of a mere excess the actual settler was besieging the office with wild protests in re having the nose of a pointer and the eye of a hawk for the land shark he had observed his myrmi dons running the lines upon his ground making inquiries he learned that the spoiler had attacked his home and he left the plough in the furrow and took his pen in hand one of the protests the commissioner read twice it was from a woman a widow the granddaughter of elias denny himself she told how her grandfather had sold most of the survey years before at a trivial price land that was now a principality in extent and value her mother had also sold a part and she herself had succeeded to this western portion along chiquito river much of it she had been forced to part with in order to live and now she owned only about three hundred acres on which she had her home her letter wound up rather pathetically i ve got eight children the oldest fifteen years i work all day and half the night to till what little land i can and keep us in clothes and books i teach my children too my neighbours is all poor and has big families the drought kills the crops every two or three years and then we has hard times to get enough to eat there is ten families on this land what the land sharks is trying to rob us of and all of them got titles from me i sold to them cheap and they aint paid out yet but part of them is and if their land should be took from them i would die my grandfather was an honest man and he helped to build up this state and he taught his children to be honest and how could i make it up to them who bought me mr commissioner if you let them land sharks take the roof from over my children and the little from them as they has to live on whoever again calls this state great or its government just will have a lie in their mouths the commissioner laid this letter aside with a sigh many many such letters he had received he had never been hurt by them nor had he ever felt that they appealed to him personally he was but the state s servant and must follow its laws and yet somehow this reflection did not always eliminate a certain responsible feeling that hung upon him of all the state s officers he was supremest in his department not even excepting the governor broad general land laws he followed it was true but he had a wide latitude in particular ramifica tions rather than law what he followed was rulings office rulings and precedents in the complicated and new questions that were being engendered by the state s development the commissioner s ruling was rarely appealed from even the courts sustained it when its equity was apparent the commissioner stepped to the door and spoke to a clerk in the other room spoke as he always did as if he were addressing a prince of the blood mr weldon will you be kind enough to ask mr ashe the state school land appraiser to please come to my office as soon as convenient ashe came quickly from the big table where he was arranging his reports mr ashe said the commissioner you worked along the chiquito river in salado colinty during your last trip i believe do you remember anything of the elias denny three league survey yes sir i do the blunt breezy surveyor answered i crossed it on my way to block h on the north side of it the road runs with the chiquito river along the valley the denny survey fronts three miles on the chiquito it is claimed continued the commissioner that it fails to reach the river by as much as a mile the appraiser shrugged his shoulder he was by birth and instinct an actual settler and the natural foe of the land shark it has always been considered to extend to the river he said dryly but that is not the point i desired to discuss said the commissioner what kind of country is this valley portion of let us say then the denny tract the spirit of the actual settler beamed in ashe s face beautiful he said with enthusiasm valley as level as this floor with just a little swell on like the sea and rich as cream just enough brakes to shelter the cattle in winter black loamy soil for six feet and then clay holds water a dozen nice little houses on it with windmills and gardens people pretty poor i guess too far from market but comfortable never saw so many kids in my life they raise flocks inquired the commissioner ho ho i mean two legged kids lauched the surveyor two legged and bare legged and tow headed children oh children mused the commissioner as though a new view had opened to him they raise children it s a lonesome country commissioner said the surveyor can you blame em i suppose continued the commissioner slowly as one carefully pursues deductions from a new stupendous theory not all of them are tow headed it would not be unreasonable mr ashe i conjecture to believe that a portion of them have brown or even black hair brown and black sure said ashe also red no doubt said the commissioner well i thank you for your courtesy in informing me mr ashe i will not detain you any longer from your duties later in the afternoon came hamlin and avery big handsome genial sauntering men clothed in white duck and low cut shoes they permeated the whole office with an aura of debonair prosperity they passed among the clerks and left a wake of abbreviated given names and fat brown cigars these were the aristocracy of the land sharks who went in for big things full of serene confidence in them selves there was no corporation no syndicate no rail road company or attorney general too big for them to tackle the peculiar smoke of their rare fat brown cigars was to be perceived in the sanctum of every department of state in every committee room of the legislature in every bank parlour and every private caucus room in the state capital always pleasant never in a hurry in seeming to possess unlimited leisure people wondered when they gave their attention to the many audacious enterprises in which they were knnown to be engaged by and by the two dropped carelessly into the com missioner s room and reclined lazily in the big leather upholstered arm chairs they drawled a good natured complaint of the weather and hamlin told the com missioner an excellent story he had amassed that morn ing from the secretary of state but the commissioner knew why they were there he had half promised to render a decision that day upon their location the chief clerk now brought in a batch of duplicate certificates for the commissioner to sign as he traced his sprawling signature hollis summerfield comr genl land office on each one the chief clerk stood deftly removing them and applying the blotter i notice said the chief clerk you ve been going through that salado county location kampfer is mak ing a new map of salado and i believe is platting in that section of the county now i will see it said the comissioner a few moments later he went to the draughtsmen s room as he entered he saw five or six of the draughtsmen grouped about kampfer s desk gargling away at each other in pectoral german and gazing at something there upon at the commissioner s approach they scattered to their several places kampfer a wizened little ger man with long frizzled ringlets and a watery eye began to stammer forth some sort of an apology the commis sioner thought for the congregation of his fellows about his desk never mind said the commissioner i wish to see the map you are making and passing around the old german seated himself upon the high draughtsman s stool kampfer continued to break english in trving to explain herr gommissioner i assure you blenty sat i haf not it bremeditated sat it wass sat it itself make look you from se field notes wass it blatted blease to observe se calls south degrees west varas south degrees east varas south south west south degrees west and so on herr gommissioner nefer would i have the commissioner raised one white hand silently kampfer dropped his pipe and fled with a hand at each side of his face and his elbows resting upon the desk the commissioner sat staring at the map which was spread and fastened there staring at the sweet and living profile of little georgia drawn thereupon at her face pensive delicate and infantile outlined in a perfect likeness when his mind at length came to inquire into the rea son of it he saw that it must have been as kampfer had said unpremeditated the old draughtsman had been platting in the elias denny survey and georgia s likeness striking though it was was formed by nothing more than the meanders of chiquito river indeed kampfer s blotter whereon his preliminary work was done showed the laborious tracings of the calls and the countless pricks of the compasses then over his faint pencilling kampfer had drawn in india ink with a full firm pen the similitude of chiquito river and forth had blossomed mysteriously the dainty pathetic profile of the child the commissioner sat for half an hour with his face in his hands gazing downward and none dared approach him then he arose and walked out in the business office he paused long enough to ask that the denny file be brought to his desk he found hamlin and avery still reclining in their chairs apparently oblivious of business they were lazily discussing summer opera it being their habit perhaps their pride also to appear supernaturally indifferent whenever they stood with large interests imperilled and they stood to win more on this stake than most people knew they possessed inside infor mation to the effect that a new railroad would within a year split this very chiquito river valley and send land values ballooning all along its route a dollar under thirty thousand profit on this location if it should hold good would be a loss to their expectations so while they chatted lightly and waited for the commissioner to open the subject there was a quick sidelong sparkle in their eyes evincing a desire to read their title clear to those fair acres on the chiquito a clerk brought in the file the commissioner seated himself and wrote upon it in red ink then he rose to his feet and stood for a while looking straight out of the window the land office capped the summit of a bold hill the eyes of the commissioner passed over the roofs of many houses set in a packing of deep green the whole checkered by strips of blinding white streets the horizon where his gaze was focussed swelled to a fair wooded eminence flecked with faint dots of shining white there was the cemetery where lay many who were forgot ten and a few who had not lived in vain and one lay there occupying very small space whose childish heart had been large enough to desire while near its last beats good to others the commissioner s lips moved slightly as he whispered to himself it was her last will and testament and i have neglected it so long the big brown cigars of hamlin and avery were fireless but they still gripped them between their teeth and waited while they marvelled at the absent expression upon the commissioner s face by and by he spoke suddenly and promptly gentlemen i have just indorsed the elias denny survey for patenting this office will not regard your location upon a part of it as legal he paused a moment and then extending his hand as those dear old time ones used to do in debate he enunciated the spirit of that ruling that subsequently drove the land sharks to the wall and placed the seal of peace and security over the doors of ten thousand homes and furthermore he continued with a clear soft light upon his face it may interest you to know that from this time on this office will consider that when a survey of land made by virtue of a certificate granted by this state to the men who wrested it from the wilderness and the savage made in good faith settled in good faith and left in good faith to their children or innocent pur chasers when such a survey although overrunning its complement shall call for any natural object visible to the eye of man to that object it shall hold and be good and valid and the children of this state shall lie down to sleep at night and rumours of disturbers of title shall not disquiet them for concluded the commissioner of such is the kingdom of heaven in the silence that followed a laugh floated up from the patent room below the man who carried down the denny file was exhibiting it among the clerks look here he said delightedly the old man has forgotten his name he s written patent to original grantee and signed it georgia summerfield comr the speech of the commissioner rebounded lightly from the impregnable hamlin and avery they smiled rose gracefully spoke of the baseball team and argued feelingly that quite a perceptible breeze had arisen from the east they lit fresh fat brown cigars and drifted courteously away but later they made another tiger spring for their quarry in the courts but the courts according to reports in the papers coolly roasted them a remarkable performance suggestive of liquid air didoes and sustained the commissioner s ruling and this ruling itself grew to be a precedent and the actual settler framed it and taught his children to spell from it and there was sound sleep o nights from the pines to the sage brush and from the chaparral to the great brown river of the north but i think and i am sure the commissioner never thought otherwise that whether kampfer was a snuffy old instrument of destiny or whether the meanders of the chiquito accidentally platted themselves into that memo rable sweet profile or not there was brought about some thing good for a whole lot of children and the result ought to be called georgia s ruling blind man s holiday alas for the man and for the artist with the shifting point of perspective life shall be a confusion of ways to the one the landscape shall rise up and confound the other take the case of lorison at one time he appeared to himself to be the feeblest of fools at another he conceived that he followed ideals so fine that the world was not yet ready to accept them during one mood he cursed his folly possessed by the other he bore himself with a serene grandeur akin to greatness in neither did he attain the perspective generations before the name had been larsen his race had bequeathed him its fine strung melancholy temperament its saving balance of thrift and industry from his point of perspective he saw himself an outcast from society forever to be a shady skulker along the ragged edge of respectability a denizen des trois quartz de monde that pathetic spheroid lying between the haut and the demi whose inhabitants envy each of their neigh bours and are scorned by both he was self condemned to this opinion as he was self exiled through it to this quaint southern city a thousand miles from his former home here he had dwelt for longer than a year know ing but few keeping in a subjective world of shadows which was invaded at times by the perplexing bulks of jarring realities then he fell in love with a girl whom he met in a cheap restaurant and his story begins the rue chartres in new orleans is a street of ghosts it lies in the quarter where the frenchman in his prime set up his translated pride and glory where also the arrogant don had swaggered and dreamed of

proprieties are menaced antonio entices and beguiles from fiery legend without but o riley teaches decorum within it was at this restaurant that lorison first saw the girl a flashy fellow with a predatory eye had followed her in and had advanced to take the other chair at the little table where she stopped but lorison slipped into the seat before him their acquaintance began and grew and how for two months they had sat at the same table each evening not meeting by appointment but as if by a series of fortuitous and happy accidents after dining they would take a walk together in one of the little city parks or among the panoramic markets where exhibits a con tinuous vaudeville of sights and sounds always at eight o clock their steps led them to a certain street corner where she prettily but firmly bade him good night and left him i do not live far from here she frequently said and you must let me go the rest of the way alone but now lorison had discovered that he wanted to go the rest of the way with her or happiness would depart leaving him on a very lonely corner of life and at the same time that he made the discovery the secret of his banishment from the society of the good laid its finger in his face and told him it must not be man is too thoroughly an egoist not to be also an egotist if he love the object shall know it during a lifetime he may conceal it through stress of expediency and honour but it shall bubble from his dying lips though it disrupt a neighbourhood it is known however that most men do not wait so long to disclose their passion in the case of lorison his particular ethics positively forbade him to declare his sentiments but he must needs dally with the subject and woo by innuendo at least on this night after the usual meal at the carabine d or he strolled with his companion down the dim old street toward the river the rue chartres perishes in the old place d armes the ancient cabildo where spanish justice fell like hail faces it and the cathedral another provincial ghost overlooks it its centre is a little iron railed park of flowers and immaculate gravelled walks where citizens take the air of evenings pedestalled high above it the general sits his cavorting steed with his face turned stonily down the river toward english turn whence come no more britons to bombard his cotton bales often the two sat in this square but to night lorison guided her past the stone stepped gate and still riverward as they walked he smiled to himself to think that all he knew of her except that be loved her was her name norah greenway and that she lived with her brother they had talked about everything except themselves perhaps her reticence had been caused by his they came at length upon the levee and sat upon a great prostrate beam the air was pungent with the dust of commerce the great river slipped yellowly past across it algiers lay a longitudinous black bulk against a vibrant electric haze sprinkled with exact stars the girl was young and of the piquant order a certain bright melancholy pervaded her she possessed an untarnished pale prettiness doomed to please her voice when she spoke dwarfed her theme it was the voice capable of investing little subjects with a large interest she sat at ease bestowing her skirts with the little womanly touch serene as if the begrimed pier were a summer garden lorison poked the rotting boards with his cane he began by telling her that he was in love with some one to whom he durst not speak of it and why not she asked accepting swiftly his fatuous presentation of a third person of straw my place in the world he answered is none to ask a woman to share i am an outcast from honest people i am wrongly accused of one crime and am i believe guilty of another thence he plunged into the story of his abdication from society the story pruned of his moral philosophy deserves no more than the slightest touch it is no new tale that of the gambler s declension during one night s sitting he lost and then had imperilled a certain amount of his employer s money which by accident he carried with him he continued to lose to the last wager and then began to gain leaving the game winner to a somewhat formidable sum the same night his employer s safe was robbed a search was had the winnings of lorison were found in his room their total forming an accusative nearness to the sum purloined he was taken tried and through incomplete evidence released smutched with the sinister devoirs of a dis agreeing jury it is not in the unjust accusation he said to the girl that my burden lies but in the knowledge that from the moment i staked the first dollar of the firm s money i was a criminal no matter whether i lost or won you see why it is impossible for me to speak of love to her it is a sad thing said norah after a little pause to think what very good people there are in the world good said lorison i was thinking of this superior person whom you say you love she must be a very poor sort of creature i do not understand nearly she continued as poor a sort of creature as yourself you do not understand said lorison removing his hat and sweeping back his fine light hair suppose she loved me in return and were willing to marry me think if you can what would follow never a day would pass but she would be reminded of her sacrifice i would read a condescension in her smile a pity even in her affection that would madden me no the thing would stand between us forever only equals should mate i could never ask her to come down upon my lower plane an arc light faintly shone upon lorison s face an illumination from within also pervaded it the girl saw the rapt ascetic look it was the face either of sir galahad or sir fool quite starlike she said is this unapproachable angel really too high to be grasped by me yes she faced him suddenly my dear friend would you prefer your star fallen lorison made a wide gesture you push me to the bald fact he declared you are not in sympathy with my argument but i will answer you so if i could reach my particular star to drag it down i would not do it but if it were fallen i would pick it up and thank heaven for the privilege they were silent for some minutes norah shivered and thrust her hands deep into the pockets of her jacket lorison uttered a remorseful exclamation i m not cold she said i was just thinking i ought to tell you something you have selected a strange confidante but you cannot expect a chance acquain ance picked up in a doubtful restaurant to be an angel norah cried lorison let me go on you have told me about yourself we have been such good friends i must tell you now what i never wanted you to know i am worse than you are i was on the stage i sang in the chorus i was pretty bad i guess i stole diamonds from the prima donna they arrested me i gave most of them up and they let me go i drank wine every night a great deal i was very wicked but lorison knelt quickly by her side and took her hands dear norah he said exultantly it is you it is you i love you never guessed it did you tis you i meant all the time now i can speak let me make you forget the past we have both suffered let us shut out the world and live for each other norah do you hear me say i love you in spite of rather say because of it you have come out of your past noble and good your heart is an angel s give it to me a little while ago you feared the future too much to even speak but for you not for myself can you love me she cast herself wildly sobbing upon his breast better than life than truth itself than every thing and my own past said lorison with a note of solicitude can you forgive and i answered you that she whispered when i told you i loved you she leaned away and looked thought fully at him if i had not told you about myself would you have would you no he interrupted i would never have let you know i loved you i would never have asked you this norah will you be my wife she wept again oh believe me i am good now i am no longer wicked i will be the best wife in the world don t think i am bad any more if you do i shall die i shall die while he was consoling her she brightened up eager and impetuous will vou marry me to night she said will you prove it that way i have a reason for wishing it to be to night will you of one of two things was this exceeding frankness the outcome either of importunate brazenness or of utter innocence the lover s perspective contained only the one the sooner said lorison the happier i shall be what is there to do she asked what do you have to get come you should know her energy stirred the dreamer to action a city directory first he cried gayly to find where the man lives who gives licenses to happiness we will go together and rout him out cabs cars policemen telephones and ministers shall aid us father rogan shall marry us said the girl with ardour i will take you to him an hour later the two stood at the open doorway of an immense gloomy brick building in a narrow and lonely street the license was tight in norah s hand wait here a moment she said till i find father rogan she plunged into the black hallway and the lover was left standing as it were on one leg outside his impa tience was not greatly taxed gazing curiously into what seemed the hallway to erebus he was presently reassured by a stream of light that bisected the darkness far down the passage then he heard her call and fluttered lampward like the moth she beckoned him through a doorway into the room whence emanated the light the room was bare of nearly everything except books which had subjugated all its space here and there little spots of territory had been reconquered an elderly bald man with a superlatively calm remote eye stood by a table with a book in his hand his finger still marking a page his dress was sombre and appertained to a religious order his eye denoted an acquaintance with the perspective father rogan said norah this is he the two of ye said father rogan want to get married they did not deny it he married them the cere mony was quickly done one who could have witnessed it and felt its scope might have trembled at the terrible inadequacy of it to rise to the dignity of its endless chain of results afterward the priest spake briefly as if by rote of certain other civil and legal addenda that either might or should at a later time cap the ceremony lorison tendered a fee which was declined and before the door closed after the departing couple father rogan s book popped open again where his finger marked it in the dark hall norah whirled and clung to her com panion tearful will you never never be sorry at last she was reassured at the first light they reached upon the street she asked the time just as she had each night lorison looked at his watch half past eight lorison thought it was from habit that she guided their steps toward the corner where they always parted but arrived there she hesitated and then released his arm a drug store stood on the corner its bright soft light shone upon them please leave me here as usual to night said norah sweetly i must i would rather you would you will not object at six to morrow evening i will meet you at antonio s i want to sit with vou there once more and then i will go where you say she gave him a bewildering bright smile and walked swiftly away surely it needed all the strength of her charm to carry off this astounding behaviour it was no discredit to lorison s strength of mind that his head began to whirl pocketing his hands he rambled vacuously over to the druggist s windows and began assiduously to spell over the names of the patent medicines therein displayed as soon as be had recovered his wits he proceeded along the street in an aimless fashion after drifting for two or three squares he flowed into a somewhat more pretentious thoroughfare a way much frequented by him in his solitary ramblings for here was a row of slops devoted to traffic in goods of the widest range of choice handiworks of art skill and fancy products of nature and labour from every zone here for a time he loitered among the conspicuous windows where was set emphasized bv congested floods of light the cunningest spoil of the interiors there were few passers and of this lorison was glad he was not of the world for a long time he had touched his fellow man only at the gear of a levelled cog wheel at right angles and upon a different axis he had dropped into a distinctly new orbit the stroke of ill fortune had acted upon him in effect as a blow delivered upon the apex of a certain ingenious toy the musical top which when thus buffeted while spinning gives forth with scarcely retarded motion a complete change of key and chord strolling along the pacific avenue he experienced singular supernatural calm accompanied by an unusual a activity of brain reflecting upon recent affairs be assured himself of his happiness in having won for a bride the one he had so greatly desired yet he wondered mildly at his dearth of active emotion her strange behaviour in abandoning him without valid excuse on his bridal eve aroused in him only a vague and curious speculation again he found himself contemplating with complaisant serenity the incidents of her somewhat lively career his perspective seemed to have been queerly shifted as he stood before a window near a corner his ears were assailed by a waxing clamour and commotion he stood close to the window to allow passage to the cause of the hubbub a procession of human beings which rounded the corner aid headed in his direction he perceived a salient hue of blue and a glitter of brass about a central figure of dazzling white and silver and a ragged wake of black bobbing figures two ponderous policemen were conducting between them a woman dressed as if for the stage in a short white satiny skirt reaching to the knees pink stockings and a sort of sleeveless bodice bright with relucent armour like scales upon her curly light hair was perched at a rollicking angle a shining tin helmet the costume was to be instantly recognized as one of those amazing con ceptions to which competition has harried the inventors of

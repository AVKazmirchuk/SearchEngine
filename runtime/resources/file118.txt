ridin in the harbor with smoke emergin from her stacks i turned down a little grass street that run down to the water on the beach i found a little brown nigger man just about to shove off in a skiff

of a clancy to gradin the tropics with a pick and shovel but tis not so much a question of insurrections now me little man as tis of the hired man problem tis anxious i am to resign a situation of responsibility and trust with the white wings department of your great and degraded country row me in your little boat out to that steamer and i ll give ye five dollars sinker pacers sinker pacers says i reducing the offer to the language and denomination of the tropic dialects cinco pesos repeats the little man five dollee you give twas not such a bad little man he had hesitations at first sayin that passengers leavin the country had to have papers and passports but at last he took me out alongside the steamer day was just breakin as we struck her and there wasn t a soul to be seen on board the water was very still and the nigger man gave me a lift from the boat and i climbed onto the steamer where her side was sliced to the deck for loadin fruit the hatches was open and i looked down and saw the cargo of bananas that filled the hold to within six feet of the top i thinks to myself clancy you better go as a stowaway it s safer the steamer men might hand you back to the employment bureau the tropic ll get you clancy if you don t watch out so i jumps down easy among the bananas and digs out a hole to hide in among the bunches in an hour or so i could hear the engines goin and feel the steamer rockin and i knew we were off to sea they left the hatches open for ventilation and pretty soon it was light enough in the hold to see fairly well i got to feelin a bit hungry and thought i d have a light fruit lunch by way of refreshment i creeped out of the hole i d made and stood up straight just then i saw another man crawl up about ten feet away and reach out and skin a banana and stuff it into his mouth twas a dirty man black faced and ragged and disgraceful of aspect yes the man was a ringer for the pictures of the fat weary willie in the funny papers i looked again and saw it was my general man de vega the great revolutionist mule rider and pickaxe importer when he saw me the general hesitated with his mouth filled with banana and his eyes the size of coconuts hist i says not a word or they ll put us off and make us walk veev la liberty i adds copperin the sentiment by shovin a banana into the source of it i was certain the general wouldn t recognize me the nefarious work of the tropics had left me lookin different there was half an inch of roan whiskers coverin me face and me costume was a pair of blue overalls and a red shirt how you come in the ship senor asked the general as soon as he could speak by the back door whist says i twas a glorious blow for liberty we struck i continues but we was overpowered by numbers let us accept our defeat like brave men and eat another banana were you in the cause of liberty fightin senor says the general sheddin tears on the cargo to the last says i twas i led the last desperate charge against the minions of the tyrant but it made them mad and we was forced to retreat twas i general procured the mule upon which you escaped could you give that ripe bunch a little boost this way general it s a bit out of my reach thanks say you so brave patriot said the general again weepin

able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say my hair grows so fast jim and them della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried oh oh jim had not yet seen his beautiful present she held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm the dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit isn t it a dandy jim i hunted all over town to find it you ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now give me your watch i want to see how it looks on it instead of obeying jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled dell said he let s put our christmas presents away and keep em a while they re too nice to use just at present i sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs and now suppose you put the chops on the magi as you know were wise men wonderfully wise men who brought gifts to the babe in the manger they invented the art of giving christmas presents being wise their gifts were no doubt wise ones possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication and here i have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house but in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest of all who give and receive gifts such as they are wisest everywhere they are wisest they are the magi a cosmopolite in a cafe at midnight the cafe was crowded by some chance the little table at which i sat had escaped the eye of incomers and two vacant chairs at it extended their arms with venal hospitality to the influx of patrons and then a cosmopolite sat in one of them and i was glad for i held a theory that since adam no true citizen of the world has existed we hear of them and we see foreign labels on much luggage but we find travellers instead of cosmopolites i invoke your consideration of the scene the marble topped tables the range of leather upholstered wall seats the gay company the ladies dressed in demi state toilets speaking in an exquisite visible chorus of taste economy opulence or art the sedulous and largess loving garcons the music wisely catering to all with its raids upon the composers the melange of talk and laughter and if you will the wurzburger in the tall glass cones that bend to your lips as a ripe cherry sways on its branch to the beak of a robber jay i was told by a sculptor from mauch chunk that the scene was truly parisian my cosmopolite was named e rushmore coglan and he will be heard from next summer at coney island he is to establish a new attraction there he informed me offering kingly diversion and then his conversation rang along parallels of latitude and longitude he took the great round world in his hand so to speak familiarly contemptuously and it seemed no larger than the seed of a maraschino cherry in a table d hote grape fruit he spoke disrespectfully of the equator he skipped from continent to continent he derided the zones he mopped up the high seas with his napkin with a wave of his hand he would speak of a certain bazaar in hyderabad whiff he would have you on skis in lapland zip now you rode the breakers with the kanakas at kealaikahiki presto he dragged you through an arkansas post oak swamp let you dry for a moment on the alkali plains of his idaho ranch then whirled you into the society of viennese archdukes anon he would be telling you of a cold he acquired in a chicago lake breeze and how old escamila cured it in buenos ayres with a hot infusion of the chuchula weed you would have addressed a letter to e rushmore coglan esq the earth solar system the universe and have mailed it feeling confident that it would be delivered to him i was sure that i had found at last the one true cosmopolite since adam and i listened to his worldwide discourse fearful lest i should discover in it the local note of the mere globe trotter but his opinions never fluttered or drooped he was as impartial to cities countries and continents as the winds or gravitation and as e rushmore coglan prattled of this little planet i thought with glee of a great almost cosmopolite who wrote for the whole world and dedicated himself to bombay in a poem he has to say that there is pride and rivalry between the cities of the earth and that the men that breed from them they traffic up and down but cling to their cities hem as a child to the mother s gown and whenever they walk by roaring streets unknown they remember their native city most faithful foolish fond making her mere breathed name their bond upon their bond and my glee was roused because i had caught mr kipling napping here i had found a man not made from dust one who had no narrow boasts of birthplace or country one who if he bragged at all would brag of his whole round globe against the martians and the inhabitants of the moon expression on these subjects was precipitated from e rushmore coglan by the third corner to our table while coglan was describing to me the topography along the siberian railway the orchestra glided into a medley the concluding air was dixie and as the exhilarating notes tumbled forth they were almost overpowered by a great clapping of hands from almost every table it is worth a paragraph to say that this remarkable scene can be witnessed every evening in numerous cafes in the city of new york tons of brew have been consumed over theories to account for it some have conjectured hastily that all southerners in town hie themselves to cafes at nightfall this applause of the rebel air in a northern city does puzzle a little but it is not insolvable the war with spain many years generous mint and watermelon crops a few long shot winners at the new orleans race track and the brilliant banquets given by the indiana and kansas citizens who compose the north carolina society have made the south rather a fad in manhattan your manicure will lisp softly that your left forefinger reminds her so much of a gentleman s in richmond va oh certainly but many a lady has to work now the war you know when dixie was being played a dark haired young man sprang up from somewhere with a mosby guerrilla yell and waved frantically his soft brimmed hat then he strayed through the smoke dropped into the vacant chair at our table and pulled out cigarettes the evening was at the period when reserve is thawed one of us mentioned three wurzburgers to the waiter the dark haired young man acknowledged his inclusion in the order by a smile and a nod i hastened to ask him a question because i wanted to try out a theory i had would you mind telling me i began whether you are from the fist of e rushmore coglan banged the table and i was jarred into silence excuse me said he but that s a question i never like to hear asked what does it matter where a man is from is it fair to judge a man by his post office address why i ve seen kentuckians who hated whiskey virginians who weren t descended from pocahontas indianians who hadn t written a novel mexicans who didn t wear velvet trousers with silver dollars sewed along the seams funny englishmen spendthrift yankees cold blooded southerners narrow minded westerners and new yorkers who were too busy to stop for an hour on the street to watch a one armed grocer s clerk do up cranberries in paper bags let a man be a man and don t handicap him with the label of any section pardon me i said but my curiosity was not altogether an idle one i know the south and when the band plays dixie i like to observe i have formed the belief that the man who applauds that air with special violence and ostensible sectional loyalty is invariably a native of either secaucus n j or the district between murray hill lyceum and the harlem river this city i was about to put my opinion to the test by inquiring of this gentleman when you interrupted with your own larger theory i must confess and now the dark haired young man spoke to me and it became evident that his mind also moved along its own set of grooves i should like to be a periwinkle said he mysteriously on the top of a valley and sing tooralloo ralloo this was clearly too obscure so i turned again to coglan i ve been around the world twelve times said he i know an esquimau in upernavik who sends to cincinnati for his neckties and i saw a goatherder in uruguay who won a prize in a battle creek breakfast food puzzle competition i pay rent on a room in cairo egypt and another in yokohama all the year around i ve got slippers waiting for me in a tea house in shanghai and i don t have to tell em how to cook my eggs in rio de janeiro or seattle it s a mighty little old world what s the use of bragging about being from the north or the south or the old manor house in the dale or euclid avenue cleveland or pike s peak or fairfax county va or hooligan s flats or any place it ll be a better world when we quit being fools about some mildewed town or ten acres of swampland just because we happened to be born there you seem to be a genuine cosmopolite i said admiringly but it also seems that you would decry patriotism a relic of the stone age declared coglan warmly we are all brothers chinamen englishmen zulus patagonians and the people in the bend of the kaw river some day all this petty pride in one s city or state or section or country will be wiped out and we ll all be citizens of the world as we ought to be but while you are wandering in foreign lands i persisted do not your thoughts revert to some spo some dear and nary a spot interrupted e r coglan flippantly the terrestrial globular planetary hunk of matter slightly flattened at the poles and known as the earth is my abode i ve met a good many object bound citizens of this country abroad i ve seen men from chicago sit in a gondola in venice on a moonlight night and brag about their drainage canal i ve seen a southerner on being introduced to the king of england hand that monarch without batting his eyes the information that his grandaunt on his mother s side was related by marriage to the perkinses of charleston i knew a new yorker who was kidnapped for ransom by some afghanistan bandits his people sent over the money and he came back to kabul with the agent afghanistan the natives said to him through an interpreter well not so slow do you think oh i don t know says he and he begins to tell them about a cab driver at sixth avenue and broadway those ideas don t suit me i m not tied down to anything that isn t miles in diameter just put me down as e rushmore coglan citizen of the terrestrial sphere my cosmopolite made a large adieu and left me for he thought he saw some one through the chatter and smoke whom he knew so i was left with the would be periwinkle who was reduced to wurzburger without further ability to voice his aspirations to perch melodious upon the summit of a valley i sat reflecting upon my evident cosmopolite and wondering how the poet had managed to miss him he was my discovery and i believed in him how was it the men that breed from them they traffic up and down but cling to their cities hem as a child to the mother s gown not so e rushmore coglan with the whole world for his my meditations were interrupted by a tremendous noise and conflict in another part of the cafe i saw above the heads of the seated patrons e rushmore coglan and a stranger to me engaged in terrific battle they fought between the tables like titans and glasses crashed and men caught their hats up and were knocked down and a brunette screamed and a blonde began to sing teasing my cosmopolite was sustaining the pride and reputation of the earth when the waiters closed in on both combatants with their famous flying wedge formation and bore them outside still resisting i called mccarthy one of the french garcons and asked him the cause of the conflict the man with the red tie that was my cosmopolite said he got hot on account of things said about the bum sidewalks and water supply of the place he come from by the other guy why said i bewildered that man is a citizen of the world a cosmopolite he originally from mattawamkeag maine he said continued mccarthy and he wouldn t stand for no knockin the place between rounds the may moon shone bright upon the private boarding house of mrs murphy by reference to the almanac a large amount of territory will be discovered upon which its rays also fell spring was in its heydey with hay fever soon to follow the parks were green with new leaves and buyers for the western and southern trade flowers and summer resort agents were blowing the air and answers to lawson were growing milder handorgans fountains and pinochle were playing everywhere the windows of mrs murphy s boarding house were open a group of boarders were seated on the high stoop upon round flat mats like german pancakes in one of the second floor front windows mrs mccaskey awaited her husband supper was cooling on the table its heat went into mrs mccaskey at nine mr mccaskey came he carried his coat on his arm and his pipe in his teeth and he apologised for disturbing the boarders on the steps as he selected spots of stone between them on which to set his size width ds as he opened the door of his room he received a surprise instead of the usual stove lid or potato masher for him to dodge came only words mr mccaskey reckoned that the benign may moon had softened the breast of his spouse i heard ye came the oral substitutes for kitchenware ye can apollygise to riff raff of the streets for settin yer unhandy feet on the tails of their frocks but ye d walk on the neck of yer wife the length of a clothes line without so much as a kiss me fut and i m sure it s that long from rubberin out the windy for ye and the victuals cold such as there s money to buy after drinkin up yer wages at gallegher s every saturday evenin and the gas man here twice to day for his woman said mr mccaskey dashing his coat and hat upon a chair the noise of ye is an insult to me appetite when ye run down politeness ye take the mortar from between the bricks of the foundations of society tis no more than exercisin the acrimony of a gentleman when ye ask the dissent of ladies blockin the way for steppin between them will ye bring the pig s face of ye out of the windy and see to the food mrs mccaskey arose heavily and went to the stove there was something in her manner that warned mr mccaskey when the corners of her mouth went down suddenly like a barometer it usually foretold a fall of crockery and tinware pig s face is it said mrs mecaskey and hurled a stewpan full of bacon and turnips at her lord mr mccaskey was no novice at repartee he knew what should follow the entree on the table was a roast sirloin of pork garnished with shamrocks he retorted with this and drew the appropriate return of a bread pudding in an earthen dish a hunk of swiss cheese accurately thrown by her husband struck mrs mccaskey below one eye when she replied with a well aimed coffee pot full of a hot black semi fragrant liquid the battle according to courses should have ended but mr mccaskey was no cent table d hoter let cheap bohemians consider coffee the end if they would let them make that faux pas he was foxier still finger bowls were not beyond the compass of his experience they were not to be had in the pension murphy but their equivalent was at hand triumphantly he sent the granite ware wash basin at the head of his matrimonial adversary mrs mccaskey dodged in time she reached for a flatiron with which as a sort of cordial she hoped to bring the gastronomical duel to a close but a loud wailing scream downstairs caused both her and mr mccaskey to pause in a sort of involuntary armistice on the sidewalk at the corner of the house policeman cleary was standing with one ear upturned listening to the crash of household utensils tis jawn mccaskey and his missis at it again meditated the policeman i wonder shall i go up and stop the row i will not married folks they are and few pleasures they have twill not last long sure they ll have to borrow more dishes to keep it up with and just then came the loud scream below stairs betokening fear or dire extremity tis probably the cat said policeman cleary and walked hastily in the other direction the boarders on the steps were fluttered mr toomey an insurance solicitor by birth and an investigator by profession went inside to analyse the scream he returned with the news that mrs murphy s little boy mike was lost following the messenger out bounced mrs murphy two hundred pounds in tears and hysterics clutching the air and howling to the sky for the loss of thirty pounds of freckles and mischief bathos truly but mr toomey sat down at the side of miss purdy millinery and their hands came together in sympathy the two old maids misses walsh who complained every day about the noise in the halls inquired immediately if anybody had looked behind the clock major grigg who sat by his fat wife on the top step arose and buttoned his coat the little one lost he exclaimed i will scour the city his wife never allowed him out after dark but now she said go ludovic in a baritone voice whoever can look upon that mother s grief without springing to her relief has a heart of stone give me some thirty or sixty cents my love said the major lost children sometimes stray far i may need carfares old man denny hall room fourth floor back who sat on the lowest step trying to read a paper by the street lamp turned over a page to follow up the article about the carpenters strike mrs murphy shrieked to the moon oh ar r mike f r gawd s sake where is me little bit av a boy when d ye see him last asked old man denny with one eye on the report of the building trades league oh wailed mrs murphy twas yisterday or maybe four hours ago i dunno but it s lost he is me little boy mike he was playin on the sidewalk only this mornin or was it wednesday i m that busy with work tis hard to keep up with dates but i ve looked the house over from top to cellar and it s gone he is oh for the love av hiven silent grim colossal the big city has ever stood against its revilers they call it hard as iron they say that no pulse of pity beats in its bosom they compare its streets with lonely forests and deserts of lava but beneath the hard crust of the lobster is found a delectable and luscious food perhaps a different simile would have been wiser still nobody should take offence we would call no one a lobster without good and sufficient claws no calamity so touches the common heart of humanity as does the straying of a little child their feet are so uncertain and feeble the ways are so steep and strange major griggs hurried down to the corner and up the avenue into billy s place gimme a rye high he said to the servitor haven t seen a bow legged dirty faced little devil of a six year old loot kid around here anywhere have you mr toomey retained miss purdy s hand on the steps think of that dear little babe said miss purdy lost from his mother s side perhaps already fallen beneath the iron hoofs of galloping steeds oh isn t it dreadful ain t that right agreed mr toomey squeezing her hand say i start out and help look for um perhaps said miss purdy you should but oh mr toomey you are so dashing so reckless suppose in your enthusiasm some accident should befall you then what old man denny read on about the arbitration agreement with one finger on the lines in the second floor front mr and mrs mccaskey came to the window to recover their second wind mr mccaskey was scooping turnips out of his vest with a crooked forefinger and his lady was wiping an eye that the salt of the roast pork had not benefited they heard the outcry below and thrust their heads out of the window tis little mike is lost said mrs mccaskey in a hushed voice the beautiful little trouble making angel of a gossoon the bit of a boy mislaid said mr mccaskey leaning out of the window why now that s bad enough entirely the childer they be different if twas a woman i d be willin for they leave peace behind em when they go disregarding the thrust mrs mccaskey caught her husband s arm jawn she said sentimentally missis murphy s little bye is lost tis a great city for losing little boys six years old he was jawn tis the same age our little bye would have been if we had had one six years ago we never did said mr mccaskey lingering with the fact but if we had jawn think what sorrow would be in our hearts this night with our little phelan run away and stolen in the city nowheres at all ye talk foolishness said mr mccaskey tis pat he would be named after me old father in cantrim ye lie said mrs mccaskey without anger me brother was worth tin dozen bog trotting mccaskeys after him would the bye be named she leaned over the window sill and looked down at the hurrying and bustle below jawn said mrs mccaskey softly i m sorry i was hasty wid ye twas hasty puddin as ye say said her husband and hurry up turnips and get a move on ye coffee twas what ye could call a quick lunch all right and tell no lie mrs mccaskey slipped her arm inside her husband s and took his rough hand in hers listen at the cryin of poor mrs murphy she said tis an awful thing for a bit of a bye to be lost in this great big city if twas our little phelan jawn i d be breakin me heart awkwardly mr mccaskey withdrew his hand but he laid it around the nearing shoulders of his wife tis foolishness of course said he roughly but i d be cut up some meself if our little pat was kidnapped or anything but there never was any childer for us sometimes i ve been ugly and hard with ye judy forget it they leaned together and looked down at the heart drama being acted below long they sat thus people surged along the sidewalk crowding questioning filling the air with rumours and inconsequent surmises mrs murphy ploughed back and forth in their midst like a soft mountain down which plunged an audible cataract of tears couriers came and went loud voices and a renewed uproar were raised in front of the boarding house what s up now judy asked mr mccaskey tis missis murphy s voice said mrs mccaskey harking she says she s after finding little mike asleep behind the roll of old linoleum under the bed in her room mr mccaskey laughed loudly that s yer phelan he shouted sardonically divil a bit would a pat have done that trick if the bye we never had is strayed and stole by the powers call him phelan and see him hide out under the bed like a mangy pup mrs mccaskey arose heavily and went toward the dish closet with the corners of her mouth drawn down policeman cleary came back around the corner as the crowd dispersed surprised he upturned an ear toward the mccaskey apartment where the crash of irons and chinaware and the ring of hurled kitchen utensils seemed as loud as before policeman cleary took out his timepiece by the deported snakes he exclaimed jawn mccaskey and his lady have been fightin for an hour and a quarter by the watch the missis could give him forty pounds weight strength to his arm policeman cleary strolled back around the corner old man denny folded his paper and hurried up the steps just as mrs murphy was about to lock the door for the night the skylight room first mrs parker would show you the double parlours you would not dare to interrupt her description of their advantages and of the merits of the gentleman who had occupied them for eight years then you would manage to stammer forth the confession that you were neither a doctor nor a dentist mrs parker s manner of receiving the admission was such that you could never afterward entertain the same feeling toward your parents who had neglected to train you up in one of the professions that fitted mrs parker s parlours next you ascended one flight of stairs and looked at the second floor back at convinced by her second floor manner that it was worth the that mr toosenberry always paid for it until he left to take charge of his brother s orange plantation in florida near palm beach where mrs mcintyre always spent the winters that had the double front room with private bath you managed to babble that you wanted something still cheaper if you survived mrs parker s scorn you were taken to look at mr skidder s large hall room on the third floor mr skidder s room was not vacant he wrote plays and smoked cigarettes in it all day long but every room hunter was made to visit his room to admire the lambrequins after each visit mr skidder from the fright caused by possible eviction would pay something on his rent then oh then if you still stood on one foot with your hot hand clutching the three moist dollars in your pocket and hoarsely proclaimed your hideous and culpable poverty nevermore would mrs parker be cicerone of yours she would honk loudly the word clara she would show you her back and march downstairs then clara the coloured maid would escort you up the carpeted ladder that served for the fourth flight and show you the skylight room it occupied x feet of floor space at the middle of the hall on each side of it was a dark lumber closet or storeroom in it was an iron cot a washstand and a chair a shelf was the dresser its four bare walls seemed to close in upon you like the sides of a coffin your hand crept to your throat you gasped you looked up as from a well and breathed once more through the glass of the little skylight you saw a square of blue infinity two dollars suh clara would say in her half contemptuous half tuskegeenial tones one day miss leeson came hunting for a room she carried a typewriter made to be lugged around by a much larger lady she was a very little girl with eyes and hair that had kept on growing after she had stopped and that always looked as if they were saying goodness me why didn t you keep up with us mrs parker showed her the double parlours in this closet she said one could keep a skeleton or anaesthetic or coal but i am neither a doctor nor a dentist said miss leeson with a shiver mrs parker gave her the incredulous pitying sneering icy stare that she kept for those who failed to qualify as doctors or dentists and led the way to the second floor back eight dollars said miss leeson dear me i m not hetty if i do look green i m just a poor little working girl show me something higher and lower mr skidder jumped and strewed the floor with cigarette stubs at the rap on his door excuse me mr skidder said mrs parker with her demon s smile at his pale looks i didn t know you were in i asked the lady to have a look at your lambrequins they re too lovely for anything said miss leeson smiling in exactly the way the angels do after they had gone mr skidder got very busy erasing the tall black haired heroine from his latest unproduced play and inserting a small roguish one with heavy bright hair and vivacious features anna held ll jump at it said mr skidder to himself putting his feet up against the lambrequins and disappearing in a cloud of smoke like an aerial cuttlefish presently the tocsin call of clara sounded to the world the state of miss leeson s purse a dark goblin seized her mounted a stygian stairway thrust her into a vault with a glimmer of light in its top and muttered the menacing and cabalistic words two dollars i ll take it sighed miss leeson sinking down upon the squeaky iron bed every day miss leeson went out to work at night she brought home papers with handwriting on them and made copies with her typewriter sometimes she had no work at night and then she would sit on the steps of the high stoop with the other roomers miss leeson was not intended for a sky light room when the plans were drawn for her creation she was gay hearted and full of tender whimsical fancies once she let mr skidder read to her three acts of his great unpublished comedy it s no kid or the heir of the subway there was rejoicing among the gentlemen roomers whenever miss leeson had time to sit on the steps for an hour or two but miss longnecker the tall blonde who taught in a public school and said well really to everything you said sat on the top step and sniffed and miss dorn who shot at the moving ducks at coney every sunday and worked in a department store sat on the bottom step and sniffed miss leeson sat on the middle step and the men would quickly group around her especially mr skidder who had cast her in his mind for the star part in a private romantic unspoken drama in real life and especially mr hoover who was forty five fat flush and foolish and especially very young mr evans who set up a hollow cough to induce her to ask him to leave off cigarettes the men voted her the funniest and jolliest ever but the sniffs on the top step and the lower step were implacable i pray you let the drama halt while chorus stalks to the footlights and drops an epicedian tear upon the fatness of mr hoover tune the pipes to the tragedy of tallow the bane of bulk the calamity of corpulence tried out falstaff might have rendered more romance to the ton than would have romeo s rickety ribs to the ounce a lover may sigh but he must not puff to the train of momus are the fat men remanded in vain beats the faithfullest heart above a inch belt avaunt hoover hoover forty five flush and foolish might carry off helen herself hoover forty five flush foolish and fat is meat for perdition there was never a chance for you hoover as mrs parker s roomers sat thus one summer s evening miss leeson looked up into the firmament and cried with her little gay laugh why there s billy jackson i can see him from down here too all looked up some at the windows of skyscrapers some casting about for an airship jackson guided it s that star explained miss leeson pointing with a tiny finger not the big one that twinkles the steady blue one near it i can see it every night through my skylight i named it billy jackson well really said miss longnecker i didn t know you were an astronomer miss leeson oh yes said the small star gazer i know as much as any of them about the style of sleeves they re going to wear next fall in mars well really said miss longnecker the star you refer to is gamma of the constellation cassiopeia it is nearly of the second magnitude and its meridian passage is oh said the very young mr evans i think billy jackson is a much better name for it same here said mr hoover loudly breathing defiance to miss longnecker i think miss leeson has just as much right to name stars as any of those old astrologers had well really said miss longnecker i wonder whether it s a shooting star remarked miss dorn i hit nine ducks and a rabbit out of ten in the gallery at coney sunday he doesn t show up very well from down here said miss leeson you ought to see him from my room you know you can see stars even in the daytime from the bottom of a well at night my room is like the shaft of a coal mine and it makes billy jackson look like the big diamond pin that night fastens her kimono with there came a time after that when miss leeson brought no formidable papers home to copy and when she went out in the morning instead of working she went from office to office and let her heart melt away in the drip of cold refusals transmitted through insolent office boys this went on there came an evening when she wearily climbed mrs parker s stoop at the hour when she always returned from her dinner at the restaurant but she had had no dinner as she stepped into the hall mr hoover met her and seized his chance he asked her to marry him and his fatness hovered above her like an avalanche she dodged and caught the balustrade he tried for her hand and she raised it and smote him weakly in the face step by step she went up dragging herself by the railing she passed mr skidder s door as he was red inking a stage direction for myrtle delorme miss leeson in his unaccepted comedy to pirouette across stage from l to the side of the count up the carpeted ladder she crawled at last and opened the door of the skylight room she was too weak to light the lamp or to undress she fell upon the iron cot her fragile body scarcely hollowing the worn springs and in that erebus of the skylight room she slowly raised her heavy eyelids and smiled for billy jackson was shining down on her calm and bright and constant through the skylight there was no world about her she was sunk in a pit of blackness with but that small square of pallid light framing the star that she had so whimsically and oh so ineffectually named miss longnecker must be right it was gamma of the constellation cassiopeia and not billy jackson and yet she could not let it be gamma as she lay on her back she tried twice to raise her arm the third time she got two thin fingers to her lips and blew a kiss out of the black pit to billy jackson her arm fell back limply good bye billy she murmured faintly you re millions of miles away and you won t even twinkle once but you kept where i could see you most of the time up there when there wasn t anything else but darkness to look at didn t you millions of miles good bye billy jackson clara the coloured maid found the door locked at the next day and they forced it open vinegar and the slapping of wrists and burnt feathers proving of no avail some one ran to phone for an ambulance in due time it backed up to the door with much gong clanging and the capable young medico in his white linen coat ready active confident with his smooth face half debonair half grim danced up the steps ambulance call to he said briefly what s the trouble oh yes doctor sniffed mrs parker as though her trouble that there should be trouble in the house was the greater i can t think what can be the matter with her nothing we could do would bring her to it s a young woman a miss elsie yes a miss elsie leeson never before in my house what room cried the doctor in a terrible voice to which mrs parker was a stranger the skylight room it evidently the ambulance doctor was familiar with the location of skylight rooms he was gone up the stairs four at a time mrs parker followed slowly as her dignity demanded on the first landing she met him coming back bearing the astronomer in his arms he stopped and let loose the practised scalpel of his tongue not loudly gradually mrs parker crumpled as a stiff garment that slips down from a nail ever afterward there remained crumples in her mind and body sometimes her curious roomers would ask her what the doctor said to her let that be she would answer if i can get forgiveness for having heard it i will be satisfied the ambulance physician strode with his burden through the pack of hounds that follow the curiosity chase and even they fell back along the sidewalk abashed for his face was that of one who bears his own dead they noticed that he did not lay down upon the bed prepared for it in the ambulance the form that he carried and all that he said was drive like h l wilson to the driver that is all is it a story in the next morning s paper i saw a little news item and the last sentence of it may help you as it helped me to weld the incidents together it recounted the reception into bellevue hospital of a young woman who had been removed from no east street suffering from debility induced by starvation it concluded with these words dr william jackson the ambulance physician who attended the case says the patient will recover a service of love when one loves one s art no service seems too hard that is our premise this story shall draw a conclusion from it and show at the same time that the premise is incorrect that will be a new thing in logic and a feat in story telling somewhat older than the great wall of china joe larrabee came out of the post oak flats of the middle west pulsing with a genius for pictorial art at six he drew a picture of the town pump with a prominent citizen passing it hastily this effort was framed and hung in the drug store window by the side of the ear of corn with an uneven number of rows at twenty he left for new york with a flowing necktie and a capital tied up somewhat closer delia caruthers did things in six octaves so promisingly in a pine tree village in the south that her relatives chipped in enough in her chip hat for her to go north and finish they could not see her f but that is our story joe and delia met in an atelier where a number of art and music students had gathered to discuss chiaroscuro wagner music rembrandt s works pictures waldteufel wall paper chopin and oolong joe and delia became enamoured one of the other or each of the other as you please and in a short time were married for see above when one loves one s art no service seems too hard mr and mrs larrabee began housekeeping in a flat it was a lonesome flat something like the a sharp way down at the left hand end of the keyboard and they were happy for they had their art and they had each other and my advice to the rich young man would be sell all thou hast and give it to the poor janitor for the privilege of living in a flat with your art and your delia flat dwellers shall indorse my dictum that theirs is the only true happiness if a home is happy it cannot fit too close let the dresser collapse and become a billiard table let the mantel turn to a rowing machine the escritoire to a spare bedchamber the washstand to an upright piano let the four walls come together if they will so you and your delia are between but if home be the other kind let it be wide and long enter you at the golden gate hang your hat on hatteras your cape on cape horn and go out by the labrador joe was painting in the class of the great magister you know his fame his fees are high his lessons are light his high lights have brought him renown delia was studying under rosenstock you know his repute as a disturber of the piano keys they were mighty happy as long as their money lasted so is every but i will not be cynical their aims were very clear and defined joe was to become capable very soon of turning out pictures that old gentlemen with thin side whiskers and thick pocketbooks would sandbag one another in his studio for the privilege of buying delia was to become familiar and then contemptuous with music so that when she saw the orchestra seats and boxes unsold she could have sore throat and lobster in a private dining room and refuse to go on the stage but the best in my opinion was the home life in the little flat the ardent voluble chats after the day s study the cozy dinners and fresh light breakfasts the interchange of ambitions ambitions interwoven each with the other s or else inconsiderable the mutual help and inspiration and overlook my artlessness stuffed olives and cheese sandwiches at p m but after a while art flagged it sometimes does even if some switchman doesn t flag it everything going out and nothing coming in as the vulgarians say money was lacking to pay mr magister and herr rosenstock their prices when one loves one s art no service seems too hard so delia said she must give music lessons to keep the chafing dish bubbling for two or three days she went out canvassing for pupils one evening she came home elated joe dear she said gleefully i ve a pupil and oh the loveliest people general general a b pinkney s daughter on seventy first street such a splendid house joe you ought to see the front door byzantine i think you would call it and inside oh joe i never saw anything like it before my pupil is his daughter clementina i dearly love her already she s a delicate thing dresses always in white and the sweetest simplest manners only eighteen years old i m to give three lessons a week and just think joe a lesson i don t mind it a bit for when i get two or three more pupils i can resume my lessons with herr rosenstock now smooth out that wrinkle between your brows dear and let s have a nice supper that s all right for you dele said joe attacking a can of peas with a carving knife and a hatchet but how about me do you think i m going to let you hustle for wages while i philander in the regions of high art not by the bones of benvenuto cellini i guess i can sell papers or lay cobblestones and bring in a dollar or two delia came and hung about his neck joe dear you are silly you must keep on at your studies it is not as if i had quit my music and gone to work at something else while i teach i learn i am always with my music and we can live as happily as millionaires on a week you mustn t think of leaving mr magister all right said joe reaching for the blue scalloped vegetable dish but i hate for you to be giving lessons it isn t art but you re a trump and a dear to do it when one loves one s art no service seems too hard said delia magister praised the sky in that sketch i made in the park said joe and tinkle gave me permission to hang two of them in his window i may sell one if the right kind of a moneyed idiot sees them i m sure you will said delia sweetly and now let s be thankful for gen pinkney and this veal roast during all of the next week the larrabees had an early breakfast joe was enthusiastic about some morning effect sketches he was doing in central park and delia packed him off breakfasted coddled praised and kissed at o clock art is an engaging mistress it was most times o clock when he returned in the evening at the end of the week delia sweetly proud but languid triumphantly tossed three five dollar bills on the x inches centre table of the x feet flat parlour sometimes she said a little wearily clementina tries me i m afraid she doesn t practise enough and i have to tell her the same things so often and then she always dresses entirely in white and that does get monotonous but gen pinkney is the dearest old man i wish you could know him joe he comes in sometimes when i am with clementina at the piano he is a widower you know and stands there pulling his white goatee and how are the semiquavers and the demisemiquavers progressing he always asks i wish you could see the wainscoting in that drawing room joe and those astrakhan rug portieres and clementina has such a funny little cough i hope she is stronger than she looks oh i really am getting attached to her she is so gentle and high bred gen pinkney s brother was once minister to bolivia and then joe with the air of a monte cristo drew forth a ten a five a two and a one all legal tender notes and laid them beside delia s earnings sold that watercolour of the obelisk to a man from peoria he announced overwhelmingly don t joke with me said delia not from peoria all the way i wish you could see him dele fat man with a woollen muffler and a quill toothpick he saw the sketch in tinkle s window and thought it was a windmill at first he was game though and bought it anyhow he ordered another an oil sketch of the lackawanna freight depot to take back with him music lessons oh i guess art is still in it i m so glad you ve kept on said delia heartily you re bound to win dear thirty three dollars we never had so much to spend before we ll have oysters to night and filet mignon with champignons said joe were is the olive fork on the next saturday evening joe reached home first he spread his on the parlour table and washed what seemed to be a great deal of dark paint from his hands half an hour later delia arrived her right hand tied up in a shapeless bundle of wraps and bandages how is this asked joe after the usual greetings delia laughed but not very joyously clementina she explained insisted upon a welsh rabbit after her lesson she is such a queer girl welsh rabbits at in the afternoon the general was there you should have seen him run for the chafing dish joe just as if there wasn t a servant in the house i know clementina isn t in good health she is so nervous in serving the rabbit she spilled a great lot of it boiling hot over my hand and wrist it hurt awfully joe and the dear girl was so sorry but gen pinkney joe that old man nearly went distracted he rushed downstairs and sent somebody they said the furnace man or somebody in the basement out to a drug store for some oil and things to bind it up with it doesn t hurt so much now what s this asked joe taking the hand tenderly and pulling at some white strands beneath the bandages it s something soft said delia that had oil on it oh joe did you sell another sketch she had seen the money on the table did i said joe just ask the man from peoria he got his depot to day and he isn t sure but he thinks he wants another parkscape and a view on the hudson what time this afternoon did you burn your hand dele five o clock i think said dele plaintively the iron i mean the rabbit came off the fire about that time you ought to have seen gen pinkney joe when sit down here a moment dele said joe he drew her to the couch sat beside her and put his arm across her shoulders what have you been doing for the last two weeks dele he asked she braved it for a moment or two with an eye full of love and stubbornness and murmured a phrase or two vaguely of gen pinkney but at length down went her head and out came the truth and tears i couldn t get any pupils she confessed and i couldn t bear to have you give up your lessons and i got a place ironing shirts in that big twentyfourth street laundry and i think i did very well to make up both general pinkney and clementina don t you joe and when a girl in the laundry set down a hot iron on my hand this afternoon i was all the way home making up that story about the welsh rabbit you re not angry are you joe and if i hadn t got the work you mightn t have sold your sketches to that man from peoria he wasn t from peoria said joe slowly well it doesn t matter where he was from how clever you are joe and kiss me joe and what made you ever suspect that i wasn t giving music lessons to clementina i didn t said joe until to night and i wouldn t have then only i sent up this cotton waste and oil from the engine room this afternoon for a girl upstairs who had her hand burned with a smoothing iron i ve been firing the engine in that laundry for the last two weeks and then you didn t my purchaser from peoria said joe and gen pinkney are both creations of the same art but you wouldn t call it either painting or music and then they both laughed and joe began when one loves one s art no service seems but delia stopped him with her hand on his lips no she said just when one loves the coming out of maggie eevery saturday night the clover leaf social club gave a hop in the hall of the give and take athletic association on the east side in order to attend one of these dances you must be a member of the give and take or if you belong to the division that starts off with the right foot in waltzing you must work in rhinegold s paper box factory still any clover leaf was privileged to escort or be escorted by an outsider to a single dance but mostly each give and take brought the paper box girl that he affected and few strangers could boast of having shaken a foot at the regular hops maggie toole on account of her dull eyes broad mouth and left handed style of footwork in the twostep went to the dances with anna mccarty and her fellow anna and maggie worked side by side in the factory and were the greatest chums ever so anna always made jimmy burns take her by maggie s house every saturday night so that her friend could go to the dance with them the give and take athletic association lived up to its name the hall of the association in orchard street was fitted out with muscle making inventions with the fibres thus builded up the members were wont to engage the police and rival social and athletic organisations in joyous combat between these more serious occupations the saturday night hop with the paper box factory girls came as a refining influence and as an efficient screen for sometimes the tip went round and if you were among the elect that tiptoed up the dark back stairway you might see as neat and satisfying a little welter weight affair to a finish as ever happened inside the ropes on saturdays rhinegold s paper box factory closed at p m on one such afternoon anna and maggie walked homeward together at maggie s door anna said as usual be ready at seven sharp mag and jimmy and me ll come by for you but what was this instead of the customary humble and grateful thanks from the non escorted one there was to be perceived a high poised head a prideful dimpling at the corners of a broad mouth and almost a sparkle in a dull brown eye thanks anna said maggie but you and jimmy needn t bother to night i ve a gentleman friend that s coming round to escort me to the hop the comely anna pounced upon her friend shook her chided and beseeched her maggie toole catch a fellow plain dear loyal unattractive maggie so sweet as a chum so unsought for a two step or a moonlit bench in the little park how was it when did it happen who was it you ll see to night said maggie flushed with the wine of the first grapes she had gathered in cupid s vineyard he s swell all right he s two inches taller than jimmy and an up to date dresser i ll introduce him anna just as soon as we get to the hall anna and jimmy were among the first clover leafs to arrive that evening anna s eyes were brightly fixed upon the door of the hall to catch the first glimpse of her friend s catch at miss toole swept into the hall with her escort quickly her triumphant eye discovered her chum under the wing of her faithful jimmy oh gee cried anna mag ain t made a hit oh no swell fellow well i guess style look at um go as far as you like said jimmy with sandpaper in his voice cop him out if you want him these new guys always win out with the push don t mind me he don t squeeze all the limes i guess huh shut up jimmy you know what i mean i m glad for mag first fellow she ever had oh here they come across the floor maggie sailed like a coquettish yacht convoyed by a stately cruiser and truly her companion justified the encomiums of the faithful chum he stood two inches taller than the average give and take athlete his dark hair curled his eyes and his teeth flashed whenever he bestowed his frequent smiles the young men of the clover leaf club pinned not their faith to the graces of person as much as they did to its prowess its achievements in hand to hand conflicts and its preservation from the legal duress that constantly menaced it the member of the association who would bind a paperbox maiden to his conquering chariot scorned to employ beau brummel airs they were not considered honourable methods of warfare the swelling biceps the coat straining at its buttons over the chest the air of conscious conviction of the supereminence of the male in the cosmogony of creation even a calm display of bow legs as subduing and enchanting agents in the gentle tourneys of cupid these were the approved arms and ammunition of the clover leaf gallants they viewed then genuflexions and alluring poses of this visitor with their chins at a new angle a friend of mine mr terry o sullivan was maggie s formula of introduction she led him around the room presenting him to each new arriving clover leaf almost was she pretty now with the unique luminosity in her eyes that comes to a girl with her first suitor and a kitten with its first mouse maggie toole s got a fellow at last was the word that went round among the paper box girls pipe mag s floor walker thus the give and takes expressed their indifferent contempt usually at the weekly hops maggie kept a spot on the wall warm with her back she felt and showed so much gratitude whenever a self sacrificing partner invited her to dance that his pleasure was cheapened and diminished she had even grown used to noticing anna joggle the reluctant jimmy with her elbow as a signal for him to invite her chum to walk over his feet through a two step but to night the pumpkin had turned to a coach and six terry o sullivan was a victorious prince charming and maggie toole winged her first

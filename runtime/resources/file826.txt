old surveyors with princely yea even western american liberality gave good measure and over flowing often the jovial man of metes and bounds would dispense altogether with the tripod and chain mounted on a pony that could cover something near a vara at a step with a pocket compass to direct his course he would trot out a survey by counting the beat of his pony s hoofs mark his corners and write out his field notes with the complacency produced by an act of duty well performed sometimes and who could blame the surveyor when the pony was feeling his oats he might step a little higher and farther and in that case the beneficiary of the scrip might get a thousand or two more acres in his survey than the scrip called for but look at the boundless leagues the state had to spare however no one ever had to complain of the pony under stepping nearly every old survey in the state con tained an excess of land in later years when the state became more populous and land values increased this careless work entailed incalculable trouble endless litigation a period of riotous land grabbing and no little bloodshed the land sharks voraciously attacked these excesses in the old surveys and filed upon such portions with new scrip as unappropriated public domain wherever the identi fications of the old tracts were vague and the corners were not to be clearly established the land office would recognize the newer locations as valid and issue title to the locators here was the greatest hardship to be found these old surveys taken from the pick of the land were already nearly all occupied by unsuspecting and peaceful settlers and thus their titles were demolished and the choice was placed before them either to buy their land over at a double price or to vacate it with their families and personal belongings immediately land locators sprang up by hundreds the country was held up and searched for vacancies at the point of a compass hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of splendid acres were wrested from their innocent purchasers and holders there began a vast hegira of evicted settlers in tattered wagons going nowhere cursing injustice stunned purposeless homeless hopeless their children began to look up to them for bread and cry it was in consequence of these conditions that hamil ton and avery had filed upon a strip of land about a mile wide and three miles long comprising about two thou sand acres it being the excess over complement of the elias denny three league survey on chiquito river in one of the middle western counties this two thousand acre body of land was asserted by them to be vacant land and improperly considered a part of the denny survey they based this assertion and their claim upon the land upon the demonstrated facts that the beginning corner of the denny survey was plainly identified that its field notes called to run west varas and then called for chiquito river thence it ran south with the meanders and so on and that the chiquito river was on the ground fully a mile farther west from the point reached by course and distance to sum up there were two thousand acres of vacant land between the denny survey proper and chiquito river one sweltering day in july the commissioner called for the papers in connection with this new location they were brought and heaped a foot deep upon his desk field notes statements sketches affidavits connecting lines documents of every description that shrewdness and money could call to the aid of hamlin and avery the firm was pressing the commissioner to issue a patent upon their location they possesed inside infor mation concerning a new railroad that would probably pass somewhere near this land the general land office was very still while the com missioner was delving into the heart of the mass of evi dence the pigeons could be heard on the roof of the old castle like building cooing and fretting the clerks were droning everywhere scarcely pretending to earn their salaries each little sound echoed hollow and loud from the bare stone flagged floors the plastered walls and the iron joisted ceiling the impalpable perpetual lime stone dust that never settled whitened a long streamer of sunlight that pierced the tattered window awning it seemed that hamlin and avery had builded well the denny survey was carelessly made even for a care less period its beginning corner was identical with that of a well defined old spanish grant but its other calls were sinfully vague the field notes contained no other object that survived no tree no natural object save chiquito river and it was a mile wrong there according to precedent the office would be justified in giving it its complement by course and distance and considering the remainder vacant instead of a mere excess the actual settler was besieging the office with wild protests in re having the nose of a pointer and the eye of a hawk for the land shark he had observed his myrmi dons running the lines upon his ground making inquiries he learned that the spoiler had attacked his home and he left the plough in the furrow and took his pen in hand one of the protests the commissioner read twice it was from a woman a widow the granddaughter of elias denny himself she told how her grandfather had sold most of the survey years before at a trivial price land that was now a principality in extent and value her mother had also sold a part and she herself had succeeded to this western portion along chiquito river much of it she had been forced to part with in order to live and now she owned only about three hundred acres on which she had her home her letter wound up rather pathetically i ve got eight

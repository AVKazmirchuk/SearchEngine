less strenuous way he chose diplomacy first the high card in the game the as sumed attitude of success already attained you have a dollar he said loftily but signifi cantly in the tone that goes with the lighting of a cigar when the properties are at hand i have said mrs peters producing the bill from her bosom and crackling it teasingly i am offered a position in a in a tea store said mr peters i am to begin work to morrow but it will be necessary for me to buy a pair of you are a liar said mrs peters reinterring the note no tea store nor no a b c store nor no junk shop would have you i rubbed the skin off both me hands washin jumpers and overalls to make that dollar do you think it come out of them suds to buy the kind you put into you skiddoo get your mind off of money evidently the poses of talleyrand were not worth one hundred cents on that dollar but diplomacy is dexterous the artistic temperament of mr peters lifted him by the straps of his congress gaiters and set him on new ground he called up a look of des perate melancholy to his eyes clara he said hollowly to struggle further is useless you have always misunderstood me heaven knows i have striven with all my might to keep my head above the waves of misfortune but cut out the rainbow of hope and that stuff about walkin one by one through the narrow isles of spain said mrs peters with a sigh i ve heard it so often there s an ounce bottle of carbolic on the shelf behind the empty coffee can drink hearty mr peters reflected what next the old ex pedients had failed the two musty musketeers were awaiting him hard by the ruined chateau that is to say on a park bench with rickety cast iron legs his honor was at stake he had engaged to storm the castle single handed and bring back the treas ure that was to furnish them wassail and solace and all that stood between him and the coveted dollar was his wife once a little girl whom he could aha why not again once with soft words he could as they say twist her around his little finger why not again not for years had he tried it grim poverty and mutual hatred had killed all that but ragsy and kidd were waiting for him to bring the dollar mr peters took a

dollar bill from its deposit vault but his arms were bound to his sides do you love me james asked mrs peters madly said james but you are ill exclaimed mrs peters why are you so pale and tired looking i feel weak said mr peters i oh wait i know what it is wait james i ll be back in a minutes with a parting bug that revived in mr peters recollections of the terrible turk his wife hurried out of the room and down the stairs mr peters hitched his thumbs under his sus penders all right he confided to the ceiling i ve got her going i hadn t any idea the old girl was soft any more under the

you re all run down boney mr peters had a tablespoonful of the stuff in serted into him then mrs peters sat on his lap and murmured call me tootsum wootsums again james he sat still held there by his

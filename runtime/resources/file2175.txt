that she was supremely beautiful after his own conception of beauty and next that she moved with exactly the steady grace of a dog sled on a level crust of snow his third sensation was an instantaneous conviction that he desired her greatly for his own this quickly do men from nome make up their minds besides he was going back to the north in a short time and to act quickly was no less necessary a thousand girls from the great department store of sieber mason flowed along the sidewalk making navigation dangerous to men whose feminine field of vision for three years has been chiefly limited to siwash and chilkat squaws but the man from nome loyal to her who had resurrected his long cached heart plunged into the stream of pulchritude and followed her down twenty third street she glided swiftly looking to neither side no more flirtatious than the bronze diana above the garden her fine brown hair was neatly braided her neat waist and unwrinkled black skirt were eloquent of the double virtues taste and economy ten yards behind followed the smitten man from nome miss claribel colby the girl from sieber mason s belonged to that sad company of mariners known as jersey commuters she walked into the waiting room of the ferry and up the stairs and by a marvellous swift little run caught the ferry boat that was just going out the man from nome closed up his ten yards in three jumps and gained the deck close beside her miss colby chose a rather lonely seat on the outside of the upper cabin the night was not cold and she desired to be away from the curious eyes and tedious voices of the passengers besides she was extremely weary and drooping from lack of sleep on the previous night she had graced the annual ball and oyster fry of the west side wholesale fish dealers assistants social club no thus reducing her usual time of sleep to only three hours and the day had been uncommonly troublous customers had been inordinately trying the buyer in her department had scolded her roundly for letting her stock run down her best friend mamie tuthill had snubbed her by going to lunch with that dockery girl the girl from sieber mason s was in that relaxed softened mood that often comes to the independent feminine wage earner it is a mood most propitious for the man who would woo her then she has yearnings to be set in some home and heart to be comforted and to hide behind some strong arm and rest rest but miss claribel colby was also very sleepy there came to her side a strong man browned and dressed carelessly in the best of clothes with his hat in his hand lady said the man from nome respectfully excuse me for speaking to you but i i i saw you on the street and and oh gee remarked the girl from sieber mason s glancing up with the most capable coolness ain t there any way to ever get rid of you mashers i ve tried everything from eating onions to using hatpins be on your way freddie i m not one of that kind lady said the man from nome honest i m not as i say i saw you on the street and i wanted to know you so bad i couldn t help followin after you i was afraid i wouldn t ever see you again in this big town unless i spoke and that s why i done so miss colby looked once shrewdly at him in the dim light on the ferry boat no he did not have the perfidious smirk or the brazen swagger of the lady killer sincerity and modesty shone through his boreal tan it seemed to her that it might be good to hear a little of what he had to say you may sit down she said laying her hand over a yawn with ostentatious politness and mind don t get fresh or i ll call the steward the man from nome sat by her side he admired her greatly he more than admired her she had exactly the looks he had tried so long in vain to find in a woman could she ever come to like him well that was to be seen he must do all in his power to stake his claim anyhow my name s blayden said he henry blayden are you real sure it ain t jones asked the girl leaning toward him with delicious knowing raillery i m down from nome he went on with anxious seriousness i scraped together a pretty good lot of dust up there and brought it down with me oh say she rippled pursuing persiflage with engaging lightness then you must be on the white wings force i thought i d seen you somewhere you didn t see me on the street to day when i saw you i never look at fellows on the street well i looked at you and i never looked at anything before that i thought was half as pretty shall i keep the change yes i reckon so i reckon you could keep anything i ve got i reckon i m what you would call a rough man but i could be awful good to anybody i liked i ve had a rough time of it up yonder but i beat the game nearly ounces of dust was what i cleaned um while i was there goodness exclaimed miss colby obligingly sympathetic it must be an awful dirty place wherever it is and then her eyes closed the voice of the man from nome had a monotony in its very earnestness besides what dull talk was this of brooms and sweeping and dust she leaned her head back against the wall miss said the man from nome with deeper earnestness and monotony i never saw anybody i liked as well as i do you i know you can t think that way of me right yet but can t you give me a chance won t you let me know you and see if i can t make you like me the head of the girl from sieber mason s slid over gently and rested upon his shoulder sweet sleep had won her and she was dreaming rapturously of the wholesale fish dealers assistants ball the gentleman from nome kept his arms to himself he did not suspect sleep and yet he was too wise to attribute the movement to surrender he was greatly and blissfully thrilled but he ended by regarding the head upon his shoulder as an encouraging preliminary merely advanced as a harbinger of his success and not to be taken advantage of one small speck of alloy discounted the gold of his satisfaction had he spoken too freely of his wealth he wanted to be liked for himself i want to say miss he said that you can count on me they know me in the klondike from juneau to circle city and down the whole length of the yukon many a night i ve laid in the snow up there where i worked like a slave for three years and wondered if i d ever have anybody to like me i didn t want all that dust just myself i thought i d meet just the right one some tine and i done it to day money s a mighty good thing to have but to have the love of the one you like best is better still if you was ever to marry a man miss which would you rather he d have cash the word came sharply and loudly from miss colby s lips giving evidence that in her dreams she was now behind her counter in the great department store of sieber mason her head suddenly bobbed over sideways she awoke sat straight and rubbed her eyes the man from nome was gone gee i believe i ve been asleep said miss colby wonder what became of the white wings the tale of a tainted tenner money talks but you may think that the conversation of a little old ten dollar bill in new york would be nothing more than a whisper oh very well pass up this sotto voce autobiography of an x if you like if you are one of the kind that prefers to listen to john d s checkbook roar at you through a megaphone as it passes by all right but don t forget that small change can say a word to the point now and then the next time you tip your grocer s clerk a silver quarter to give you extra weight of his boss s goods read the four words above the lady s head how are they for repartee i am a ten dollar treasury note series of you may have seen one in a friend s hand on my face in the centre is a picture of the bison americanus miscalled a buffalo by fifty or sixty millions of americans the heads of capt lewis and capt clark adorn the ends on my back is the graceful figure of liberty or ceres or maxine elliot standing in the centre of the stage on a conservatory plant my references is or are section revised statutes ten cold hard dollars i don t say whether silver gold lead or iron uncle sam will hand you over his counter if you want to cash me in i beg you will excuse any conversational breaks that i make thanks i knew you would got that sneaking little respect and agreeable feeling toward even an x haven t you you see a tainted bill doesn t have much chance to acquire a correct form of expression i never knew a really cultured and educated person that could afford to hold a ten spot any longer than it would take to do an arthur duffy to the nearest that s all sign or delicatessen store for a six year old i ve had a lively and gorgeous circulation i guess i ve paid as many debts as the man who dies i ve been owned by a good many kinds of people but a little old ragged damp dingy five dollar silver certificate gave me a jar one day i was next to it in the fat and bad smelling purse of a butcher hey you sitting bull says i don t scrouge so anyhow don t you think it s about time you went in on a customs payment and got reissued for a series of you re a sight oh don t get crackly just because you re a buffalo bill says the fiver you d be limp too if you d been stuffed down in a thick cotton and lisle thread under an elastic all day and the thermometer not a degree under in the store i never heard of a pocketbook like that says i who carried you a shopgirl says the five spot what s that i had to ask you ll never know till their millennium comes says the fiver just then a two dollar bill behind me with a george washington head spoke up to the fiver aw cut out yer kicks ain t lisle thread good enough for yer if you was under all cotton like i ve been to day and choked up with factory dust till the lady with the cornucopia on me sneezed half a dozen times you d have some reason to complain that was the next day after i arrived in new york i came in a package of tens to a brooklyn bank from one of its pennsylvania correspondents and i haven t made the acquaintance of any of the five and two spot s friends pocketbooks yet silk for mine every time i was lucky money i kept on the move sometimes i changed hands twenty times a day i saw the inside of every business i fought for my owner s every pleasure it seemed that on saturday nights i never missed being slapped down on a bar tens were always slapped down while ones and twos were slid over to the bartenders folded i got in the habit of looking for mine and i managed to soak in a little straight or some spilled martini or manhattan whenever i could once i got tied up in a great greasy roll of bills in a pushcart peddler s jeans i thought i never would get in circulation again for the future department store owner lived on eight cents worth of dog meat and onions a day but this peddler got into trouble one day on account of having his cart too near a crossing and i was rescued i always will feel grateful to the cop that got me he changed me at a cigar store near the bowery that was running a crap game in the back room so it was the captain of the precinct after all that did me the best turn when he got his he blew me for wine the next evening in a broadway restaurant and i really felt as glad to get back again as an astor does when he sees the lights of charing cross a tainted ten certainly does get action on broadway i was alimony once and got folded in a little dogskin purse among a lot of dimes they were bragging about the busy times there were in ossining whenever three girls got hold of one of them during the ice cream season but it s slow moving vehicles keep to the right for the little bok tips when you think of the way we bison plasters refuse to stick to anything during the rush lobster hour the first i ever heard of tainted money was one night when a good thing with a van to his name threw me over with some other bills to buy a stack of blues about midnight a big easy going man with a fat face like a monk s and the eye of a janitor with his wages raised tooks me and a lot of other notes and rolled us into what is termed a wad among the money tainters ticket me for five hundred said he to the banker and look out for everything charlie i m going out for a stroll in the glen before the moonlight fades from the brow of the cliff if anybody finds the roof in their way there s wrapped in a comic supplement in the upper left hand corner of the safe be bold everywhere be bold but be not bowled over night i found myself between two gold certificates one of em says to me well old shorthorn you re in luck to night you ll see something of life old jack s going to make the tenderloin look like a hamburg steak explain says i i m used to joints but i don t care for filet mignon with the kind of sauce you serve xcuse me said the twenty old jack is the proprietor of this gambling house he s going on a whiz to night because he offered to a church and it refused to accept it because they said his money was tainted what is a church i asked oh i forgot says the twenty that i was talking to a tenner of course you don t know you re too much to put into the contribution basket and not enough to buy anything at a bazaar a church is a large building in which penwipers and tidies are sold at each i don t care much about chinning with gold certificates there s a streak of yellow in em all is not gold that s quitters old jack certainly was a gild edged sport when it came his time to loosen up he never referred the waiter to an actuary by and by it got around that be was smiting the rock in the wilderness and all along broadway things with cold noses and hot gullets fell in on our trail the third jungle book was there waiting for somebody to put covers on it old jack s money may have had a taint to it but all the same he had orders for his camembert piling up on him every minute first his friends rallied round him and then the fellows that his friends knew by sight and then a few of his enemies buried the hatchet and finally he was buying souvenirs for so many neapolitan fisher maidens and butterfly octettes that the head waiters were phoning all over town for julian mitchell to please come around and get them into some kind of order at last we floated into an uptown cafe that i knew by heart when the hod carriers union in jackets and aprons saw us coming the chief goal kicker called out six eleven forty two nineteen twelve to his men and they put on nose guards till it was clear whether we meant port arthur or portsmouth but old jack wasn t working for the furniture and glass factories that night he sat down quiet and sang ramble in a half hearted way his feelings had been hurt so the twenty told me because his offer to the church had been refused but the wassail went on and brady himself couldn t have hammered the thirst mob into a better imitation of the real penchant for the stuff that you screw out of a bottle with a napkin old jack paid the twenty above me for a round leaving me on the outside of his roll he laid the roll on the table and sent for the proprietor mike says he here s money that the good people have refused will it buy of your wares in the name of the devil they say it s tainted i will says mike and i ll put it in the drawer next to the bills that was paid to the parson s daughter for kisses at the church fair to build a new parsonage for the parson s daughter to live in at o clock when the hod carriers were making ready to close up the front and keep the inside open a woman slips in the door of the restaurant and comes up to old jack s table you ve seen the kind black shawl creepy hair ragged skirt white face eyes a cross between gabriel s and a sick kitten s the kind of woman that s always on the lookout for an automobile or the mendicancy squad and she stands there without a word and looks at the money old jack gets up peels me off the roll and hands me to her with a bow madam says he just like actors i ve heard here is a tainted bill i am a gambler this bill came to me to night from a gentleman s son where he got it i do not know if you will do me the favor to accept it it is yours the woman took me with a trembling hand sir said she i counted thousands of this issue of bills into packages when they were virgin from the presses i was a clerk in the treasury department there was an official to whom i owed my position you say they are tainted now if you only knew but i won t say any more thank you with all my heart sir thank you thank you where do you suppose that woman carried me almost at a run to a bakery away from old jack and a sizzling good time to a bakery and i get changed and she does a sheridan twenty miles away with a dozen rolls and a section of jelly cake as big as a turbine water wheel of course i lost sight of her then for i was snowed up in the bakery wondering whether i d get changed at the drug store the next day in an alum deal or paid over to the cement works a week afterward i butted up against one of the one dollar bills the baker had given the woman for change hallo e says i weren t you in the change for me in a bakery last saturday night yep says the solitaire in his free and easy style how did the deal turn out i asked she blew e for mills and round steak says the one spot she kept me till the rent man came it was a bum room with a sick kid in it but you ought to have seen him go for the bread and tincture of formaldehyde half starved i guess then she prayed some don t get stuck up tenner we one spots hear ten prayers where you hear one she said something about who giveth to the poor oh let s cut out the slum talk i m certainly tired of the company that keeps me i wish i was big enough to move in society with you tainted bills shut up says i there s no such thing i know the rest of it there s a lendeth to the lord somewhere in it now look on my back and read what you see there this note is a legal tender at its face value for all debts public and private this talk about tainted money makes me tired says i elsie in new york no bumptious reader this story is not a continuation of the elsie series but if your elsie had lived over here in our big city there might have been a chapter in her books not very different from this especially for the vagrant feet of youth are the roads of manhattan beset with pitfall and with gin but the civic guardians of the young have made themselves acquainted with the snares of the wicked and most of the dangerous paths are patrolled by their agents who seek to turn straying ones away from the peril that menaces them and this will tell you how they guided my elsie safely through all peril to the goal that she was seeking elsie s father had been a cutter for fox otter cloaks and furs on lower broadway he was an old man with a slow and limping gait so a pot hunter of a newly licensed chauffeur ran him down one day when livelier game was scarce they took the old man home where he lay on his bed for a year and then died leaving in cash and a letter from mr otter offering to do anything he could to help his faithful old employee the old cutter regarded this letter as a valuable legacy to his daughter and he put it into her hands with pride as the shears of the dread cleaner and repairer snipped off his thread of life that was the landlord s cue and forth he came and did his part in the great eviction scene there was no snowstorm ready for elsie to steal out into drawing her little red woollen shawl about her shoulders but she went out regardless of the unities and as for the red shawl back to blaney with it elsie s fall tan coat was cheap but it had the style and fit of the best at fox otter s and her lucky stars had given her good looks and eyes as blue and innocent as the new shade of note paper and she had left of the and the letter from mr otter keep your eye on the letter from mr otter that is the clue i desire that everything be made plain as we go detective stories are so plentiful now that they do not sell and so we find elsie thus equipped starting out in the world to seek her fortune one trouble about the letter from mr otter was that it did not bear the new address of the firm which had moved about a month before but elsie thought she could find it she had heard that policemen when politely addressed or thumbscrewed by an investigation committee will give up information and addresses so she boarded a downtown car at one hundred and seventy seventh street and rode south to forty second which she thought must surely be the end of the island there she stood against the wall undecided for the city s roar and dash was new to her up where she had lived was rural new york so far out that the milkmen awaken you in the morning by the squeaking of pumps instead of the rattling of cans a kind faced sunburned young man in a soft brimmed hat went past elsie into the grand central depot that was hank ross of the sunflower ranch in idaho on his way home from a visit to the east hank s heart was heavy for the sunflower ranch was a lonesome place lacking the presence of a woman he had hoped to find one during his visit who would congenially share his prosperity and home but the girls of gotham had not pleased his fancy but as he passed in he noted with a jumping of his pulses the sweet ingenuous face of elsie and her pose of doubt and loneliness with true and honest western impulse he said to himself that here was his mate he could love her he knew and he would surround her with so much comfort and cherish her so carefully that she would be happy and make two sunflowers grow on the ranch where there grew but one before hank turned and went back to her backed by his never before questioned honesty of purpose he approached the girl and removed his soft brimmed hat elsie had but time to sum up his handsome frank face with one shy look of modest admiration when a burly cop hurled himself upon the ranchman seized him by the collar and backed him against the wall two blocks away a burglar was coming out of an apartment house with a bag of silverware on his shoulder but that is neither here nor there carry on yez mashin tricks right before me eyes will yez shouted the cop i ll teach yez to speak to ladies on me beat that ye re not acquainted with come along elsie turned away with a sigh as the ranchman was dragged away she had liked the effect of his light blue eyes against his tanned complexion she walked southward thinking herself already in the district where her father used to work and hoping to find some one who could direct her to the firm of fox otter but did she want to find mr otter she had inherited much of the old cutter s independence how much better it would be if she could find work and support herself without calling on him for aid elsie saw a sign employment agency and went in many girls were sitting against the wall in chairs several well dressed ladies were looking them over one white haired kind faced old lady in rustling black silk hurried up to elsie my dear she said in a sweet gentle voice are you looking for a position i like your face and appearance so much i want a young woman who will be half maid and half companion to me you will have a good home and i will pay you a month before elsie could stammer forth her gratified acceptance a young woman with gold glasses on her bony nose and her hands in her jacket pockets seized her arm and drew her aside i am miss ticklebaum said she of the association for the prevention of jobs being put up on working girls looking for jobs we prevented forty seven girls from securing positions last week i am here to protect you beware of any one who offers you a job how do you know that this woman does not want to make you work as a breaker boy in a coal mine or murder you to get your teeth if you accept work of any kind without permission of our association you will be arrested by one of our agents but what am i to do asked elsie i have no home or money i must do something why am i not allowed to accept this kind lady s offer i do not know said miss ticklebaum that is the affair of our committee on the abolishment of employers it is my duty simply to see that you do not get work you will give me your name and address and report to our secretary every thursday we have girls on the waiting list who will in time be allowed to accept positions as vacancies occur on our roll of qualified employers which now comprises twenty seven names there is prayer music and lemonade in our chapel the third sunday of every month elsie hurried away after thanking miss ticklebaum for her timely warning and advice after all it seemed that she must try to find mr otter but after walking a few blocks she saw a sign cashier wanted in the window of a confectionery store in she went and applied for the place after casting a quick glance over her shoulder to assure herself that the job preventer was not on her trail the proprietor of the confectionery was a benevolent old man with a peppermint flavor who decided after questioning elsie pretty closely that she was the very girl he wanted her services were needed at once so elsie with a thankful heart drew off her tan coat and prepared to mount the cashier s stool but before she could do so a gaunt lady wearing steel spectacles and black mittens stood before her with a long finger pointing and exclaimed young woman hesitate elsie hesitated do you know said the black and steel lady that in accepting this position you may this day cause the loss of a hundred lives in agonizing physical torture and the sending as many souls to perdition why no said elsie in frightened tones how could i do that ruin said the lady the demon rum do you know why so many lives are lost when a theatre catches fire brandy balls the demon rum lurking in brandy balls our society women while in theatres sit grossly intoxicated from eating these candies filled with brandy when the fire fiend sweeps down upon them they are unable to escape the candy stores are the devil s distilleries if you assist in the distribution of these insidious confections you assist in the destruction of the bodies and souls of your fellow beings and in the filling of our jails asylums and almshouses think girl ere you touch the money for which brandy balls are sold dear me said elsie bewildered i didn t know there was rum in brandy balls but i must live by some means what shall i do decline the position said the lady and come with me i will tell you what to do after elsie had told the confectioner that she had changed her mind about the cashiership she put on her coat and followed the lady to the sidewalk where awaited an elegant victoria seek some other work said the black and steel lady and assist in crushing the hydra headed demon rum and she got into the victoria and drove away i guess that puts it up to mr otter again said elsie ruefully turning down the street and i m sorry too for i d much rather make my way without help near fourteenth street elsie saw a placard tacked on the side of a doorway that read fifty girls neat sewers wanted immediately on theatrical costumes good pay she was about to enter when a solemn man dressed all in black laid his hand on her arm my dear girl he said i entreat you not to enter that dressing room of the devil goodness me exclaimed elsie with some impatience the devil seems to have a cinch on all the business in new york what s wrong about the place it is here said the solemn man that the regalia of satan in other words the costumes worn on the stage are manufactured the stage is the road to ruin and destruction would you imperil your soul by lending the work of your hands to its support do you know my dear girl what the theatre leads to do you know where actors and actresses go after the curtain of the playhouse has fallen upon them for the last time sure said elsie into vaudeville but do you think it would be wicked for me to make a little money to live on by sewing i must get something to do pretty soon the flesh pots of egypt exclaimed the reverend gentleman uplifting his hands i beseech you my child to turn away from this place of sin and iniquity but what will i do for a living asked elsie i don t care to sew for this musical comedy if it s as rank as you say it is but i ve got to have a job the lord will provide said the solemn man there is a free bible class every sunday afternoon in the basement of the cigar store next to the church peace be with you amen farewell elsie went on her way she was soon in the downtown district where factories abound on a large brick building was a gilt sign posey trimmer artificial flowers below it was hung a newly stretched canvas hearing the words five hundred girls wanted to learn trade good wages from the start apply one flight up elsie started toward the door near which were gathered in groups some twenty or thirty girls one big girl with a black straw hat tipped down over her eyes stepped in front of her say you se said the girl are you se goin in there after a job yes said elsie i must have work now don t do it said the girl i m chairman of our scab committee there s of us girls locked out just because we demanded cents a week raise in wages and ice water and for the foreman to shave off his mustache you re too nice a looking girl to be a scab wouldn t you please help us along by trying to find a job somewhere else or would you se rather have your face pushed in i ll try somewhere else said elsie she walked aimlessly eastward on broadway and there her heart leaped to see the sign fox otter stretching entirely across the front of a tall building it was as though an unseen guide had led her to it through the by ways of her fruitless search for work she hurried into the store and sent in to mr otter by a clerk her name and the letter he had written her father she was shown directly into his private office mr otter arose from his desk as elsie entered and took both hands with a hearty smile of welcome he was a slightly corpulent man of nearly middle age a little bald gold spectacled polite well dressed radiating well well and so this is beatty s little daughter your father was one of our most efficient and valued employees he left nothing well well i hope we have not forgotten his faithful services i am sure there is a vacancy now among our models oh it is easy work nothing easier mr otter struck a bell a long nosed clerk thrust a portion of himself inside the door send miss hawkins in said mr otter miss hawkins came miss hawkins said mr otter bring for miss beatty to try on one of those russian sable coats and let s see one of those latest model black tulle hats with white tips elsie stood before the full length mirror with pink cheeks and quick breath her eyes shone like faint stars she was beautiful alas she was beautiful i wish i could stop this story here confound it i will no it s got to run it out i didn t make it up i m just repeating it i d like to throw bouquets at the wise cop and the lady who rescues girls from jobs and the prohibitionist who is trying to crush brandy balls and the sky pilot who objects to costumes for stage people there are others and all the thousands of good people who are at work protecting young people from the pitfalls of a great city and then wind up by pointing out how they were the means of elsie reaching her father s benefactor and her kind friend and rescuer from poverty this would make a fine elsie story of the old sort i d like to do this but there s just a word or two to follow while elsie was admiring herself in the mirror mr otter went to the telephone booth and called up some number don t ask me what it was oscar said he i want you to reserve the same table for me this evening what why the one in the moorish room to the left of the shrubbery yes two yes the usual brand and the johannisburger with the roast if it isn t the right temperature i ll break your neck no not her no indeed a new one a peacherino oscar a peacherino tired and tiresome reader i will conclude if you please with a paraphrase of a few words that you will remember were written by him by him of gad s hill before whom if you doff not your hat you shall stand with a covered pumpkin aye sir a pumpkin lost your excellency lost associations and societies lost right reverends and wrong reverends of every order lost reformers and lawmakers born with heavenly compassion in your hearts but with the reverence of money in your souls and lost thus around us every day the voice of the city the voice of the city twenty five years ago the school children used to chant their lessons the manner of their delivery was a singsong recitative between the utterance of an episcopal minister and the drone of a tired sawmill i mean no disrespect we must have lumber and sawdust i remember one beautiful and instructive little lyric that emanated from the physiology class the most striking line of it was this the shin bone is the long est bone in the hu man bod y what an inestimable boon it would have been if all the corporeal and spiritual facts pertaining to man bad thus been tunefully and logically inculcated in our youthful minds but what we gained in anatomy music and philosophy was meagre the other day i became confused i needed a ray of light i turned back to those school days for aid but in all the nasal harmonies we whined forth from those bard benches i could not recall one that treated of the voice of agglomerated mankind in other words of the composite vocal message of massed humanity in other words of the voice of a big city now the individual voice is not lacking we can understand the song of the poet the ripple of the brook the meaning of the man who wants until next monday the inscriptions on the tombs of the pharaohs the language of flowers the step lively of the conductor and the prelude of the milk cans at a m certain large eared ones even assert that they are wise to the vibrations of the tympanum pro need by concussion of the air emanating from mr h james but who can comprehend the meaning of the voice of the city i went out for to see first i asked aurelia she wore white swiss and a bat with flowers on it and ribbons and ends of things fluttered here and there tell me i said stammeringly for i have no voice of my own what does this big er enormous er whopping city say it must have a voice of some kind does it ever speak to you how do you interpret its meaning it is a tremen dous mass but it must have a key like a saratoga trunk asked aurelia no said i please do not refer to the lid i have a fancy that every city has a voice each one has something to say to the one who can hear it what does the big one say to you all cities said aurelia judicially say the same thing when they get through saying it there is an echo from philadelphia so they are unanimous here are people said i scholastic ally compressed upon an island which is mostly lamb surrounded by wall street water the conjunc tion of so many units into so small a space must result in an identity or or rather a homogeneity that finds its oral expression through a common chan nel it is as you might say a consensus of transla tion concentrating in a crystallized general idea which reveals itself in what may be termed the voice of the city can you tell me what it is aurelia smiled wonderfully she sat on the high stoop a spray of insolent ivy bobbed against her right ear a ray of impudent moonlight flickered upon her nose but i was adamant nickel plated i must go and find out i said what is the voice of this city other cities have voices it is an assignment i must have it new york i con tinned in a rising tone had better not hand me a cigar and say old man i can t talk for publication no other city acts in that way chicago says unhes itatingly i will i philadelphia says i should new orleans says i used to louisville says don t care if i do st louis says excuse me pittsburg says smoke up now new york aurelia smiled very well said i i must go elsewhere and find out i went into a palace tile floored cherub ceilinged and square with the cop i put my foot on the brass rail and said to billy magnus the best bartender in the diocese billy you ve lived in new york a long time what kind of a song and dance does this old town give you what i mean is doesn t the gab of it seem to kind of bunch up and slide over the bar to you in a sort of amalgamated tip that bits off the burg in a kind of an epigram with a dash of bitters and a slice of excuse me a minute said billy somebody s punching the button at the side door he went away came back with an empty tin bucket again vanished with it full returned and said to me that was mame she rings twice she likes a glass of beer for supper her and the kid if you ever saw that little skeesicks of mine brace up in his high chair and take his beer and but say what was yours i get kind of excited when i bear them two rings was it the baseball score or gin fizz you asked for ginger ale i answered i walked up to broadway i saw a cop on the cor ner the cops take kids up women across and men in i went up to him if i m not exceeding the spiel limit i said let me ask you you see new york during its vocative hours it is the function of you and your brother cops to preserve the acoustics of the city there must be a civic voice that is intelligible to you at night during your lonely rounds you must have beard it what is the epitome of its turmoil and shouting what does the city say to you friend said the policeman spinning his club it don t say nothing i get my orders from the man higher up say i guess you re all right stand here for a few minutes and keep an eye open for the roundsman the cop melted into the darkness of the side street in ten minutes be had returned married last tuesday be said half gruffly you know bow they are she comes to that corner at nine every night for a comes to say hello i generally manage to be there say what was it you asked me a bit ago what s doing in the city oh there s a roof garden or two just opened twelve blocks up i crossed a crow s foot of street car tracks and skirted the edge of an umbrageous park an artificial diana gilded heroic poised wind ruled on the tower shimmered in the clear light of her namesake in the sky along came my poet hurry ing hatted haired emitting dactyls spondees and dactylis i seized him bill said i in the magazine he is cleon give me a lift i am on an assignment to find out the voice of the city you see it s a special order ordi narily a symposium comprising the views of henry clews john l sullivan edwin markham may ir win and charles schwab would be about all but this is a different matter we want a broad poetic mystic vocalization of the city s soul and meaning you are the very chap to give me a hint some years ago a man got at the niagara falls and gave us its pitch the note was about two feet below the lowest g on the piano now you can t put new york into a note unless it s better indorsed than that but give me an idea of what it would say if it should speak it is bound to be a mighty and far reaching utterance to arrive at it we must take the tremendous crash of the chords of the day s traffic the laughter and music of the night the solemn tones of dr parkhurst the rag time the weeping the stealthy bum of cab wbeels the shout of the press agent the tinkle of fountains on the roof gardens the hullabaloo of the strawberry vender and the covers of everybody s magazine the whispers of the lovers in the parks all these sounds must go into your voice not combined but mixed and of the mixture an essence made and of the es sence an extract an audible extract of which one drop shall form the thing we seek do you remember asked the poet with a chuckle that california girl we met at stiver s studio last week well i m on my way to see her she repeated that poem of mine the tribute of spring word for word she s the smartest proposi tion in this town just at present say how does this confounded tie look i spoiled four before i got one to set right and the voice that i asked you about i in quired oh she doesn t sing said cleon but you ought to bear her recite my angel of the inshore wind i passed on i cornered a newsboy and be flashed at me prophetic pink papers that outstripped the news by two revolutions of the clock s longest hand son i said while i pretended to chase coins in my penny pocket doesn t it sometimes seem to you as if the city ought to be able to talk all these ups and downs and funny business and queer things hap pening every daywhat would it say do you think if it could speak quit yer kiddin said the boy wot paper yer want i got no time to waste it s mag s birthday and i want thirty cents to git her a present here was no interpreter of the city s mouthpiece i bought a paper and consigned its undeclared treaties its premeditated murders and unfought bat tles to an ash can again i repaired to the park and sat in the moon shade i thought and thought and wondered why none could tell me what i asked for and then as swift as light from a fixed star the answer came to me i arose and hurried hurried as so many reasoners must back around my circle i knew the answer and i bugged it in my breast as i flew fearing lest some one would stop me and demand my secret aurelia was still on the stoop the moon was higher and the ivy shadows were deeper i sat at her side and we watched a little cloud tilt at the drifting moon and go asunder quite pale and discomfited and then wonder of wonders and delight of de lights our hands somehow touched and our fingers closed together and did not part after half an hour aurelia said with that smile of hers do you know you haven t spoken a word since you came back that said i nodding wisely is the voice of the city the complete life of john hopkins there is a saying that no man has tasted the full flavor of life until he has known poverty love and war the justness of this reflection commends it to the lover of condensed philosophy the three condi tions embrace about all there is in life worth knowing a surface thinker might deem that wealth should be added to the list not so when a poor man finds a long bidden quarter dollar that has slipped through a rip into his vest lining be sounds the pleasure of life with a deeper plummet than any millionaire can hope to cast it seems that the wise executive power that rules life has thought best to drill man in these three con ditions and none may escape all three in rural places the terms do not mean so much poverty is less pinching love is temperate war shrinks to con tests about boundary lines and the neighbors hens it is in the cities that our epigram gains in truth and vigor and it has remained for one john hopkins to crowd the experience into a rather small space of time the hopkins flat was like a thousand others there was a rubber plant in one window a flea bitten terrier sat in the other wondering when he was to have his day john hopkins was like a thousand others he worked at per week in a nine story red brick building at either insurance buckle s hoisting en gines chiropody loans pulleys boas renovated waltz guaranteed in five lessons or artificial limbs it is not for us to wring mr hopkins s avo cation from these outward signs that be mrs hopkins was like a thousand others the auriferous tooth the sedentary disposition the sun day afternoon wanderlust the draught upon the delicatessen store for home made comforts the furor for department store marked down sales the feeling of superiority to the lady in the third floor front who wore genuine ostrich tips and had two names over her bell the mucilaginous hours during which she remained glued to the window sill the vigi lant avoidance of the instalment man the tireless patronage of the acoustics of the dumb waiter shaft all the attributes of the gotham flat dweller were hers one moment yet of sententiousness and the story moves in the big city large and sudden things happen you round a corner and thrust the rib of your um brella into the eye of your old friend from kootenai falls you stroll out to pluck a sweet william in the park and lo bandits attack you you are am bulanced to the hospital you marry your nurse are divorced get squeezed while short on u p s and d w n s stand in the bread line marry an heiress take out your laundry and pay your club dues seemingly all in the wink of an eye you travel the streets and a finger beckons to you a handkerchief is dropped for you a brick is dropped upon you the elevator cable or your bank breaks a table d hote or your wife disagrees with you and fate tosses you about like cork crumbs in wine opened by an un feed waiter the city is a sprightly young ster and you are red paint upon its toy and you get licked off john hopkins sat after a compressed dinner in his glove fitting straight front flat he sat upon a hornblende couch and gazed with satiated eyes at art brought home to the people in the shape of the storm tacked against the wall mrs hop kins discoursed droningly of the dinner smells from the flat across the ball the flea bitten terrier gave hopkins a look of disgust and showed a man hating tooth here was neither poverty love nor war but upon such barren stems may be grafted those essentials of a complete life john hopkins sought to inject a few raisins of conversation into the tasteless dough of existence putting a new elevator in at the office he said discarding the nominative noun and the boss has turned out his whiskers you don t mean it commented mrs hopkins mr whipples continued john wore his new spring suit down to day i liked it fine it s a gray with he stopped suddenly stricken by a need that made itself known to him i believe i ll walk down to the corner and get a five cent cigar he concluded john hopkins took his bat aid picked his way down the musty halls and stairs of the flat house the evening air was mild and the streets shrill with the careless cries of children playing games con trolled by mysterious rhythms and phrases their elders held the doorways and steps with leisurely pipe and gossip paradoxically the fire escapes sup ported lovers in couples who made no attempt to fly the mounting conflagration they were there to fan the corner cigar store aimed at by john hopkins was kept by a man named freshmayer who looked upon the earth as a sterile promontory hopkins unknown in the store entered and called genially for his bunch of spinach car fare grade this imputation deepened the pessimism of fresh mayer but be set out a brand that came perilously near to filling the order hopkins bit off the roots of his purchase and lighted up at the swinging gas jet feeling in his pockets to make payment he found not a penny there say my friend he explained frankly i ve come out without any change hand you that nickel first time i pass joy surged in freshmayer s heart here was cor roboration of his belief that the world was rotten and man a peripatetic evil without a word he rounded the end of his counter and made earnest onslaught upon his customer hopkins was no man to serve as a punching bag for a pessimistic tobacconist he quickly bestowed upon freshmayer a colorado maduro eye in return for the ardent kick that be received from that dealer in goods for cash only the impetus of the enemy s attack forced the hopkins line back to the sidewalk there the con flict raged the pacific wooden indian with his carven smile was overturned and those of the street who delighted in carnage pressed round to view the zealous joust but then came the inevitable cop and imminent convenience for both the attacker and attacked john hopkins was a peaceful citizen who worked at rebuses of nights in a flat but be was not without the fundamental spirit of resistance that comes with the battle rage he knocked the policeman into a gro cer s sidewalk display of goods and gave freshmayer a punch that caused him temporarily to regret that he had not made it a rule to extend a five cent line of credit to certain customers then hopkins took spiritedly to his heels down the sidewalk closely fol lowed by the cigar dealer and the policeman whose uniform testified to the reason in the grocer s sign that read eggs cheaper than anywhere else in the city as hopkins ran he became aware of a big low red racing automobile that kept abreast of him in the street this auto steered in to the side of the sidewalk and the man guiding it motioned to hopkins to jump into it he did so without slackening his speed and fell into the turkey red upholstered seat beside the chauffeur the big machine with a dimin uendo cough flew away like an albatross down the avenue into which the street emptied the driver of the auto sped his machine without a word he was masked beyond guess in the goggles and diabolic garb of the chauffeur much obliged old man called hopkins grate fully i guess you ve got sporting blood in you all right and don t admire the sight of two men trying to soak one little more and i d have been pinched the chauffeur made no sign that he had heard hopkins shrugged a shoulder and chewed at his cigar to which his teeth had clung grimly through out the melee ten minutes and the auto turned into the open carriage entrance of a noble mansion of brown stone and stood still the chauffeur leaped out and said come quick the lady she will explain it is the great honor you will have monsieur ah that milady could call upon armand to do this thing but no i am only one chauffeur with vehement gestures the chauffeur conducted hopkins into the house he was ushered into a small but luxurious reception chamber a lady young and possessing the beauty of visions rose from a chair in her eyes smouldered a becoming anger her high arched threadlike brows were ruffled into a delicious frown milady said the chauffeur bowing low i have the honor to relate to you that i went to the house of monsieur long and found him to be not at home as i came back i see this gentleman in combat against bow you say greatest odds he is fighting with five ten thirty men gendarmes aussi yes milady he what you call swat one three eight policemans if that monsieur long is out i say to myself this gentleman be will serve milady so well and i bring him here very well armand said the lady you may go she turned to hopkins i sent my chauffeur she said to bring my cousin walter long there is a man in this house who has treated me with insult and abuse i have complained to my aunt and she laughs at me ar mand says you are brave in these prosaic days men who are both brave and chivalrous are few may i count upon your assistance john hopkins thrust the remains of his cigar into his coat pocket he looked upon

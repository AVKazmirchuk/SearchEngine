in his effective conclusion when he aroused me by continuing of course said he our schemes were at an end there was no one to take don rafael s place our little army melted away like dew before the sun one day after i had returned to new orleans i related this story to a friend who holds a professorship in tulane university when i had finished he laughed and asked whether i had any knowledge of kearny s luck afterward i told him no that i had seen him no more but that when he left me he had expressed confidence that his future would be successful now that his unlucky star had been overthrown no doubt said the professor he is happier not to know one fact if he derives his bad luck from phoebe the ninth satellite of saturn that malicious lady is still engaged in overlooking his career the star close to saturn that he imagined to be her was near that planet simply by the chance of its orbit probably at different times he has regarded many other stars that happened to be in saturn s neighbourhood as his evil one the real phoebe is visible only through a very good telescope about a year afterward continued captain malone i was walking down a street that crossed the poydras market an immensely stout pink faced lacy in black satin crowded me from the narrow sidewalk with a frown behind her trailed a little man laden to the gunwales with bundles and bags of goods and vegetables it was kearny but changed i stopped and shook one of his hands which still clung to a bag of garlic and red peppers how is the luck old companero i asked him i had not the heart to tell him the truth about his star well said he i am married as you may guess francis called the big lady in deep tones are you going to stop in the street talking all day i am coming phoebe dear said kearny hastening after her captain malone ceased again after all do you believe in luck i asked do you answered the captain with his ambiguous smile shaded by the brim of his soft straw hat a double dyed deceiver the trouble began in laredo it was the llano kid s fault for he should have confined his habit of manslaughter to mexicans but the kid was past twenty and to have only mexicans to one s credit at twenty is to blush unseen on the rio grande border it happened in old justo valdos s gambling house there was a poker game at which sat players who were not all friends as happens often where men ride in from afar to shoot folly as she gallops there was a row over so small a matter as a pair of queens and when the smoke had cleared away it was found that the kid had committed an indiscretion and his adversary had been guilty of a blunder for the unfortunate combatant instead of being a greaser was a high blooded youth from the cow ranches of about the kid s own age and possessed of friends and champions his blunder in missing the kid s right ear only a sixteenth of an inch when he pulled his gun did not lessen the indiscretion of the better marksman the kid not being equipped with a retinue nor bountifully supplied with personal admirers and supporters on account of a rather umbrageous reputation even for the border considered it not incompatible with his indispensable gameness to perform that judicious tractional act known as pulling his freight quickly the avengers gathered and sought him three of them overtook him within a rod of the station the kid turned and showed his teeth in that brilliant but mirthless smile that usually preceded his deeds of insolence and violence and his pursuers fell back without making it necessary for him even to reach for his weapon but in this affair the kid had not felt the grim thirst for encounter that usually urged him on to battle it had been a purely chance row born of the cards and certain epithets impossible for a gentleman to brook that had passed between the two the kid had rather liked the slim haughty brown faced young chap whom his bullet had cut off in the first pride of manhood and now he wanted no more blood he wanted to get away and have a good long sleep somewhere in the sun on the mesquit grass with his handkerchief over his face even a mexican might have crossed his path in safety while he was in this mood the kid openly boarded the north bound passenger train that departed five minutes later but at webb a few miles out where it was flagged to take on a traveller he abandoned that manner of escape there were telegraph stations ahead and the kid looked askance at electricity and steam saddle and spur were his rocks of safety the man whom he had shot was a stranger to him but the kid knew that he was of the coralitos outfit from hidalgo and that the punchers from that ranch were more relentless and vengeful than kentucky feudists when wrong or harm was done to one of them so with the wisdom that has characterized many great farmers the kid decided to pile up as many leagues as possible of chaparral and pear between himself and the retaliation of the coralitos bunch near the station was a store and near the store scattered among the mesquits and elms stood the saddled horses of the customers most of them waited half asleep with sagging limbs and drooping heads but one a long legged

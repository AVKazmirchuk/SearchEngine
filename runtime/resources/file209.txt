a week at the university and afterward i would rise and tell a humorous story once the gazette printed my pictures with abe lincoln on one side and marshall p wilder on the other andy was as interested in philanthropy as i was we used to wake up of nights and tell each other new ideas for booming the university andy says i to him one day there s something we overlooked the boys ought to have dromedaries what s that andy asks why something to sleep in of course says i all colleges have em oh you mean pajamas says andy i do not says i i mean dromedaries but i never could make andy understand so we never ordered em of course i meant them long bedrooms in colleges where the scholars sleep in a row well sir the world s university was a success we had scholars from five states and territories and floresville had a boom a new shooting gallery and a pawn shop and two more saloons started and the boys got up a college yell that went this way raw raw raw done done done peters tucker lots of fun bow wow wow haw hee haw world university hip hurrah the scholars was a fine lot of young men and me and andy was as proud of em as if they belonged to our own family but one day about the last of october andy comes to me and asks if i have any idea how much money we had left in the bank i guesses about sixteen thousand our balance says andy is what says i with a kind of a yell do you mean to tell me that them infernal clod hopping dough headed pup faced goose brained gate stealing rabbit eared sons of horse thieves have soaked us for that much no less says andy then to helvetia with philanthropy says i not necessarily says andy philanthropy says he when run on a good business basis is one of the best grafts going i ll look into the matter and see if it can t be straightened out the next week i am looking over the payroll of our faculty when i run across a new name professor james darnley mccorkle chair of mathematics salary per week i yells so loud that andy runs in quick what s this says i a professor of mathematics at more than a year how did this happen did he get in through the window and appoint himself i wired to frisco for him a week ago says andy in ordering the faculty we seemed to have overlooked the chair of mathematics a good thing we did says i we can pay his salary two weeks and then our philanthropy will look like the ninth hole on the skibo golf links wait a while says andy and see how things turn out we have taken up too noble a cause to draw out now besides the further i gaze into the retail philanthropy business the better it looks to me i never thought about investigating it before come to think of it now goes on andy all the philanthropists i ever knew had plenty of money i ought to have looked into that matter long ago and located which was the cause and which was the effect i had confidence in andy s chicanery in financial affairs so i left the whole thing in his hands the university was flourishing fine and me and andy kept our silk hats shined up and floresville kept on heaping honors on us like we was millionaires instead of almost busted philanthropists the students kept the town lively and prosperous some stranger came to town and started a faro bank over the red front livery stable and began to amass money in quantities me and andy strolled up one night and piked a dollar or two for sociability there were about fifty of our students there drinking rum punches and shoving high stacks of blues and reds about the table as the dealer turned the cards up why dang it andy says i these free school hunting gander headed silk socked little sons of sap suckers have got more money than you and me ever had look at the rolls they re pulling out of their pistol pockets yes says andy a good many of them are sons of wealthy miners and stockmen it s very sad to see em wasting their opportunities this way at christmas all the students went home to spend the holidays we had a farewell blowout at the university and andy lectured on modern music and prehistoric literature of the archipelagos each one of the faculty answered to toasts and compared me and andy to rockefeller and the emperor marcus autolycus i pounded on the table and yelled for professor mccorkle but it seems he wasn t present on the occasion i wanted a look at the man that andy thought could earn a week in philanthropy that was on the point of making an assignment the students all left on the night train and the town sounded as quiet as the campus of a correspondence school at midnight when i went to the hotel i saw a light in andy s room and i opened the door and walked in there sat andy and the faro dealer at a table dividing a two foot high stack of currency in thousand dollar packages correct says andy thirty one thousand apiece come in jeff says he this is our share of the profits of the first half of the scholastic term of the world s university incorporated and philanthropated are you convinced now says andy that philanthropy when practiced in a business way is an art that blesses him who gives as well as him who receives great says i feeling fine i ll admit you are the doctor this time we ll be leaving

has too much money to be attended by rising young practitioners alone when gales came we put tom through as expensive a course of treatment as the resources of the profession permit after the more drastic remedies we gave him citrate of caffeine in frequent doses and strong coffee and walked him up and down the floor between two of us old gales pinched him and slapped his face and worked hard for the big check he could see in the distance the young m d from the next floor gave tom a most hearty rousing kick and then apologized to me couldn t help it he said i never kicked a millionaire before in my life i may never have another opportunity now said doctor gales after a couple of hours he ll do but keep him awake for another hour you can do that by talking to him and shaking him up occasionally when his pulse and respiration are normal then let him sleep i ll leave him with you now i was left alone with tom whom we had laid on a couch he lay very still and his eyes were half closed i began my work of keeping him awake well old man i said you ve had a narrow squeak but we ve pulled you through when you were attending lectures tom didn t any of the professors ever casually remark that m o r p h i a never spells quinia especially in four grain doses but i won t pile it up on you until you get on your feet but you ought to have been a druggist tom you re splendidly qualified to fill prescriptions tom looked at me with a faint and foolish smile b ly he murmured i feel jus like a hum n bird flyin around a jolly lot of most shpensive roses don bozzer me goin sleep now and he went to sleep in two seconds i shook him by the shoulder now tom i said severely this won t do the big doctor said you must stay awake for at least an hour open your eyes you re not entirely safe yet you know wake up tom hopkins weighs one hundred and ninety eight he gave me another somnolent grin and fell into deeper slumber i would have made him move about but i might as well have tried to make cleopatra s needle waltz around the room with me tom s breathing became stertorous and that in connection with morphia poisoning means danger then i began to think i could not rouse his body i must strive to excite his mind make him angry was an idea that suggested itself good i thought but how there was not a joint in tom s armour dear old fellow he was good nature itself and a gallant gentleman fine and true and clean as sunlight he came from somewhere down south where they still have ideals and a code new york had charmed but had not spoiled him he had that old fashioned chivalrous reverence for women that eur eka there was my idea i worked the thing up for a minute or two in my imagination i chuckled to myself at the thought of springing a thing like that on old tom hopkins then i took him by the shoulder and shook him till his ears flopped he opened his eyes lazily i assumed an expression of scorn and contempt and pointed my finger within two inches of his nose listen to me hopkins i said in cutting and distinct tones you and i have been good friends but i want you to understand that in the future my doors are closed against any man who acts as much like a scoundrel as you have tom looked the least bit interested what s the matter billy he muttered composedly don t your clothes fit you if i were in your place i went on which thank god i am not i think i would be afraid to close my eyes how about that girl you left waiting for you down among those lonesome southern pines the girl that you ve forgotten since you came into your confounded money oh i know what i m talking about while you were a poor medical student she was good enough for you but now since you are a millionaire it s different i wonder what she thinks of the performances of that peculiar class of people which she has been taught to worship the southern gentlemen i m sorry hopkins that i was forced to speak about these matters but you ve covered it up so well and played your part so nicely that i would have sworn you were above such unmanly tricks poor tom i could scarcely keep from laughing outright to see him struggling against the effects of the opiate he was distinctly angry and i didn t blame him tom had a southern temper his eyes were open now and they showed a gleam or two of fire but the drug still clouded his mind and bound his tongue c c confound you he stammered i ll s smash you he tried to rise from the couch with all his size he was very weak now i thrust him back with one arm he lay there glaring like a lion in a trap that will hold you for a while you old loony i said to myself i got up and lit my pipe for i was needing a smoke i walked around a bit congratulating myself on my brilliant idea i heard a snore i looked around tom was asleep again i walked over and punched him on the jaw he looked at me as pleasant and ungrudging as an idiot i chewed my pipe and gave it to him hard i want you to recover yourself and get out of my rooms as soon as you can i said insultingly i ve told you what i think of you if you have any honour or honesty left you will think twice before you attempt again to associate with gentlemen she s a poor girl isn t she i sneered somewhat too plain and unfashionable for us since we got our money be ashamed to walk on fifth avenue with her wouldn t you hopkins you re forty seven times worse than a cad who cares for your money i don t i ll bet that girl don t perhaps if you didn t have it you d be more of a man as it is you ve made a cur of yourself and i thought that quite dramatic perhaps broken a faithful heart old tom hopkins breaking a faithful heart let me be rid of you as soon as possible i turned my back on tom and winked at myself in a mirror i heard him moving and i turned again quickly i didn t want a hundred and ninety eight pounds falling on me from the rear but tom had only turned partly over and laid one arm across his face he spoke a few words rather more distinctly than before i couldn t have talked this way to you billy even if i d heard people lyin bout you but jus soon s i can s stand up i ll break your neck don f get it i did feel a little ashamed then but it was to save tom in the morning when i explained it we would have a good laugh over it together in about twenty minutes tom dropped into a sound easy slumber i felt his pulse listened to his respiration and let him sleep everything was normal and tom was safe i went into the other room and tumbled into bed i found tom up and dressed when i awoke the next morning he was entirely himself again with the exception of shaky nerves and a tongue like a white oak chip what an idiot i was he said thoughtfully i remember thinking that quinine bottle looked queer while i was taking the dose have much trouble in bringing me round i told him no his memory seemed bad about the entire affair i concluded that he had no recollection of my efforts to keep him awake and decided not to enlighten him some other time i thought when he was feeling better we would have some fun over it when tom was ready to go he stopped with the door open and shook my hand much obliged old fellow he said quietly for taking so much trouble with me and for what you said i m going down now to telegraph to the little girl a ghost of a chance actually a hod repeated mrs kinsolving pathetically mrs bellamy bellmore arched a sympathetic eyebrow thus she expressed condolence and a generous amount of apparent surprise fancy her telling everywhere recapitulated mrs kinsolving that she saw a ghost in the apartment she occupied here our choicest guest room a ghost carrying a hod on its shoulder the ghost of an old man in overalls smoking a pipe and carrying a hod the very absurdity of the thing shows her malicious intent there never was a kinsolving that carried a hod every one knows that mr kinsolving s father accumulated his money by large building contracts but he never worked a day with his own hands he had this house built from his own plans but oh a hod why need she have been so cruel and malicious it is really too bad murmured mrs bellmore with an approving glance of her fine eyes about the vast chamber done in lilac and old gold and it was in this room she saw it oh no i m not afraid of ghosts don t have the least fear on my account i m glad you put me in here i think family ghosts so interesting but really the story does sound a little inconsistent i should have expected something better from mrs fischer suympkins don t they carry bricks in hods why should a ghost bring bricks into a villa built of marble and stone i m so sorry but it makes me think that age is beginning to tell upon mrs fischer suympkins this house continued mrs kinsolving was built upon the site of an old one used by the family during the revolution there wouldn t be anything strange in its having a ghost and there was a captain kinsolving who fought in general greene s army though we ve never been able to secure any papers to vouch for it if there is to be a family ghost why couldn t it have been his instead of a bricklayer s the ghost of a revolutionary ancestor wouldn t be a bad idea agreed mrs bellmore but you know how arbitrary and inconsiderate ghosts can be maybe like love they are engendered in the eye one advantage of those who see ghosts is that their stories can t be disproved by a spiteful eye a revolutionary knapsack might easily be construed to be a hod dear mrs kinsolving think no more of it i am sure it was a knapsack but she told everybody mourned mrs kinsolving inconsolable she insisted upon the details there is the pipe and how are you going to get out of the overalls shan t get into them said mrs bellmore with a prettily suppressed yawn too stiff and wrinkly is that you felice prepare my bath please do you dine at seven at clifftop mrs kinsolving so kind of you to run in for a chat before dinner i love those little touches of informality with a guest they give such a home flavour to a visit so sorry i must be dressing i am so indolent i always postpone it until the last moment mrs fischer suympkins had been the first large plum that the kinsolvings had drawn from the social pie for a long time the pie itself had been out of reach on a top shelf but the purse and the pursuit had at last lowered it mrs fischer suympkins was the heliograph of the smart society parading corps the glitter of her wit and actions passed along the line transmitting whatever was latest and most daring in the game of peep show formerly her fame and leadership had been secure enough not to need the support of such artifices as handing around live frogs for favours at a cotillon but now these things were necessary to the holding of her throne beside middle age had come to preside incongruous at her capers the sensational papers had cut her space from a page to two columns her wit developed a sting her manners became more rough and inconsiderate as if she felt the royal necessity of establishing her autocracy by scorning the conventionalities that bound lesser potentates to some pressure at the command of the kinsolvings she had yielded so far as to honour their house by her presence for an evening and night she had her revenge upon her hostess by relating with grim enjoyment and sarcastic humour her story of the vision carrying the hod to that lady in raptures at having penetrated thus far toward the coveted inner circle the result came as a crushing disappointment everybody either sympathized or laughed and there was little to choose between the two modes of expression but later on mrs kinsolving s hopes and spirits were revived by the capture of a second and greater prize mrs bellamy bellmore had accepted an invitation to visit at clifftop and would remain for three days mrs bellmore was one of the younger matrons whose beauty descent and wealth gave her a reserved seat in the holy of holies that required no strenuous bolstering she was generous enough thus to give mrs kinsolving the accolade that was so poignantly desired and at the same time she thought how much it would please terence perhaps it would end by solving him terence was mrs kinsolving s son aged twenty nine quite good looking enough and with two or three attractive and mysterious traits for one he was very devoted to his mother and that was sufficiently odd to deserve notice for others he talked so little that it was irritating and he seemed either very shy or very deep terence interested mrs bellmore because she was not sure which it was she intended to study him a little longer unless she forgot the matter if he was only shy she would abandon him for shyness is a bore if he was deep she would also abandon him for depth is precarious on the afternoon of the third day of her visit terence hunted up mrs bellmore and found her in a nook actually looking at an album it s so good of you said he to come down here and retrieve the day for us i suppose you have heard that mrs fischer suympkins scuttled the ship before she left she knocked a whole plank out of the bottom with a hod my mother is grieving herself ill about it can t you manage to see a ghost for us while you are here mrs bellmore a bang up swell ghost with a coronet on his head and a cheque book under his arm that was a naughty old lady terence said mrs bellmore to tell such stories perhaps you gave her too much supper your mother doesn t really take it seriously does she i think she does answered terence one would think every brick in the hod had dropped on her it s a good mammy and i don t like to see her worried it s to be hoped that the ghost belongs to the hod carriers union and will go out on a strike if he doesn t there will be no peace in this family i m sleeping in the ghost chamber said mrs bellmore pensively but it s so nice i wouldn t change it even if i were afraid which i m not it wouldn t do for me to submit a counter story of a desirable aristocratic shade would it i would do so with pleasure but it seems to me it would be too obviously an antidote for the other narrative to be effective true said terence running two fingers thoughtfully into his crisp brown hair that would never do how would it work to see the same ghost again minus the overalls and have gold bricks in the hod that would elevate the spectre from degrading toil to a financial plane don t you think that would be respectable enough there was an ancestor who fought against the britishers wasn t there your mother said something to that effect i believe so one of those old chaps in raglan vests and golf trousers i don t care a continental for a continental myself but the mother has set her heart on pomp and heraldry and pyrotechnics and i want her to be happy you are a good boy terence said mrs bellmore sweeping her silks close to one side of her not to beat your mother sit here by me and let s look at the album just as people used to do twenty years ago now tell me about every one of them who is this tall dignified gentleman leaning against the horizon with one arm on the corinthian column that old chap with the big feet inquired terence craning his neck that s great uncle o brannigan he used to keep a rathskeller on the bowery i asked you to sit down terence if you are not going to amuse or obey me i shall report in the morning that i saw a ghost wearing an apron and carrying schooners of beer now that is better to be shy at your age terence is a thing that you should blush to acknowledge at breakfast on the last morning of her visit mrs bellmore startled and entranced every one present by announcing positively that she had seen the ghost did it have a a a mrs kinsolving in her suspense and agitation could not bring out the word no indeed far from it there was a chorus of questions from others at the table were n t you frightened what did it do how did it look how was it dressed did it say anything didn t you scream i ll try to answer everything at once said mrs bellmore heroically although i m frightfully hungry something awakened me i m not sure whether it was a noise or a touch and there stood the phantom i never burn a light at night so the room was quite dark but i saw it plainly i wasn t dreaming it was a tall man all misty white from head to foot it wore the full dress of the old colonial days powdered hair baggy coat skirts lace ruffles and a sword it looked intangible and luminous in the dark and moved without a sound yes i was a little frightened at first or startled i should say it was the first ghost i had ever seen no it didn t say anything i didn t scream i raised up on my elbow and then it glided silently away and disappeared when it reached the door mrs kinsolving was in the seventh heaven the description is that of captain kinsolving of general greene s army one of our ancestors she said in a voice that trembled with pride and relief i really think i must apologize for our ghostly relative mrs bellmore i am afraid he must have badly disturbed your rest terence sent a smile of pleased congratulation toward his mother attainment was mrs kinsolving s at last and he loved to see her happy i suppose i ought to be ashamed to confess said mrs bellmore who was now enjoying her breakfast that i wasn t very much disturbed i presume it would have been the customary thing to scream and faint and have all of you running about in picturesque costumes but after the first alarm was over i really couldn t work myself up to a panic the ghost retired from the stage quietly and peacefully after doing its little turn and i went to sleep again nearly all listened politely accepted mrs bellmore s story as a made up affair charitably offered as an offset to the unkind vision seen by mrs fischer suympkins but one or two present perceived that her assertions bore the genuine stamp of her own convictions truth and candour seemed to attend upon every word even a scoffer at ghosts if he were very observant would have been forced to admit that she had at least in a very vivid dream been honestly aware of the weird visitor soon mrs bellmore s maid was packing in two hours the auto would come to convey her to the station as terence was strolling upon the east piazza mrs bellmore came up to him with a confidential sparkle in her eye i didn t wish to tell the others all of it she said but i will tell you in a way i think you should be held responsible can you guess in what manner that ghost awakened me last night rattled chains suggested terence after some thought or groaned they usually do one or the other do you happen to know continued mrs bellmore with sudden irrelevancy if i resemble any one of the female relatives of your restless ancestor captain kinsolving don t think so said terence with an extremely puzzled air never heard of any of them being noted beauties then why said mrs bellmore looking the young man gravely in the eye should that ghost have kissed me as i m sure it did heavens exclaimed terence in wide eyed amazement you don t mean that mrs bellmore did he actually kiss you i said it corrected mrs bellmore i hope the impersonal pronoun is correctly used but why did you say i was responsible because you are the only living male relative of the ghost i see unto the third and fourth generation but seriously did he did it how do you know how does any one know i was asleep and that is what awakened me i m almost certain almost well i awoke just as oh can t you understand what i mean when anything arouses you suddenly you are not positive whether you dreamed or and yet you know that dear me terence must i dissect the most elementary sensations in order to accommodate your extremely practical intelligence but about kissing ghosts you know said terence humbly i require the most primary instruction i never kissed a ghost is it is it the sensation said mrs bellmore with deliberate but slightly smiling emphasis since you are seeking instruction is a mingling of the material and the spiritual of course said terence suddenly growing serious it was a dream or some kind of an hallucination nobody believes in spirits these days if you told the tale out of kindness of heart mrs bellmore i can t express how grateful i am to you it has made my mother supremely happy that revolutionary ancestor was a stunning idea mrs bellmore sighed the usual fate of ghost seers is mine she said resignedly my privileged encounter with a spirit is attributed to lobster salad or mendacity well i have at least one memory left from the wreck a kiss from the unseen world was captain kinsolving a very brave man do you know terence he was licked at yorktown i believe said terence reflecting they say he skedaddled with his company after the first battle there i thought he must have been timid said mrs bellmore absently he might have had another another battle asked terence dully what else could i mean i must go and get ready now the auto will be here in an hour i ve enjoyed clifftop immensely such a lovely morning isn t it terence on her way to the station mrs bellmore took from her bag a silk handkerchief and looked at it with a little peculiar smile then she tied it in several very hard knots and threw it at a convenient moment over the edge of the cliff along which the road ran in his room terence was giving some directions to his man brooks have this stuff done up in a parcel he said and ship it to the address on that card the card was that of a new york costumer the stuff was a gentleman s costume of the days of made of white satin with silver buckles white silk stockings and white kid shoes a powdered wig and a sword completed the dress and look about brooks added terence a little anxiously for a silk handkerchief with my initials in one corner i must have dropped it somewhere it was a month later when mrs bellmore and one or two others of the smart crowd were making up a list of names for a coaching trip through the catskills mrs bellmore looked over the list for a final censoring the name of terence kinsolving was there mrs bellmore ran her prohibitive pencil lightly through the name too shy she murmured sweetly in explanation jimmy hayes and muriel i supper was over and there had fallen upon the camp the silence that accompanies the rolling of corn husk cigarettes the water hole shone from the dark earth like a patch of fallen sky coyotes yelped dull thumps indicated the rocking horse movements of the hobbled ponies as they moved to fresh grass a half troop of the frontier battalion of texas rangers were distributed about the fire a well known sound the fluttering and scraping of chaparral against wooden stirrups came from the thick brush above the camp the rangers listened cautiously they heard a loud and cheerful voice call out reassuringly brace up muriel old girl we re most there now been a long ride for ye ain t it ye old antediluvian handful of animated carpet tacks hey now quit a tryin to kiss me don t hold on to my neck so tight this here paint hoss ain t any too shore footed let me tell ye he s liable to dump us both off if we don t watch out two minutes of waiting brought a tired paint pony single footing into camp a gangling youth of twenty lolled in the saddle of the muriel whom he had been addressing nothing was to be seen hi fellows shouted the rider cheerfully this here s a letter fer lieutenant manning he dismounted unsaddled dropped the coils of his stake rope and got his hobbles from the saddle horn while lieutenant manning in command was reading the letter the newcomer rubbed solicitously at some dried mud in the loops of the hobbles showing a consideration for the forelegs of his mount boys said the lieutenant waving his hand to the rangers this is mr james hayes he s a new member of the company captain mclean sends him down from el paso the boys will see that you have some supper hayes as soon as you get your pony hobbled the recruit was received cordially by the rangers still they observed him shrewdly and with suspended judgment picking a comrade on the border is done with ten times the care and discretion with which a girl chooses a sweetheart on your side kicker s nerve loyalty aim and coolness your own life may depend many times after a hearty supper hayes joined the smokers about the fire his appearance did not settle all the questions in the minds of his brother rangers they saw simply a loose lank youth with tow coloured sun burned hair and a berry brown ingenuous face that wore a quizzical good natured smile fellows said the new ranger i m goin to interduce to you a lady friend of mine ain t ever heard anybody call her a beauty but you ll all admit she s got some fine points about her come along muriel he held open the front of his blue flannel shirt out of it crawled a horned frog a bright red ribbon was tied jauntily around its spiky neck it crawled to its owner s knee and sat there motionless this here muriel said hayes with an oratorical wave of his hand has got qualities she never talks back she always stays at home and she s satisfied with one red dress for every day and sunday too look at that blame insect said one of the rangers with a grin i ve seen plenty of them horny frogs but i never knew anybody to have one for a side partner does the blame thing know you from anybody else take it over there and see said hayes the stumpy little lizard known as the horned frog is harmless he has the hideousness of the prehistoric monsters whose reduced descendant he is but he is gentler than the dove the ranger took muriel from hayes s knee and went back to his seat on a roll of blankets the captive twisted and clawed and struggled vigorously in his hand after holding it for a moment or two the ranger set it upon the ground awkwardly but swiftly the frog worked its four oddly moving legs until it stopped close by hayes s foot well dang my hide said the other ranger the little cuss knows you never thought them insects had that much sense ii jimmy hayes became a favourite in the ranger camp he had an endless store of good nature and a mild perennial quality of humour that is well adapted to camp life he was never without his horned frog in the bosom of his shirt during rides on h is knee or shoulder in camp under his blankets at night the ugly little beast never left him jimmy was a humourist of a type that prevails in the rural south and west unskilled in originating methods of amusing or in witty conceptions he had hit upon a comical idea and clung to it reverently it had seemed to jimmy a very funny thing to have about his person with which to amuse his friends a tame horned frog with a red ribbon around its neck as it was a happy idea why not perpetuate it the sentiments existing between jimmy and the frog cannot be exactly determined the capability of the horned frog for lasting affection is a subject upon which we have had no symposiums it is easier to guess jimmy s feelings muriel was his chef d oeuvre of wit and as such he cherished her he caught flies for her and shielded her from sudden northers yet his care was half selfish and when the time came she repaid him a thousand fold other muriels have thus overbalanced the light attentions of other jimmies not at once did jimmy hayes attain full brotherhood with his comrades they loved him for his simplicity and drollness but there hung above him a great sword of suspended judgment to make merry in camp is not all of a ranger s life there are horse thieves to trail desperate criminals to run down bravos to battle with bandits to rout out of the chaparral peace and order to be compelled at the muzzle of a six shooter jimmy had been most generally a cow puncher he said he was inexperienced in ranger methods of warfare therefore the rangers speculated apart and solemnly as to how he would stand fire for let it be known the honour and pride of each ranger company is the individual bravery of its members for two months the border was quiet the rangers lolled listless in camp and then bringing joy to the rusting guardians of the frontier sebastiano saldar an eminent mexican desperado and cattle thief crossed the rio grande with his gang and began to lay waste the texas side there were indications that jimmy hayes would soon have the opportunity to show his mettle the rangers patrolled with alacrity but saldar s men were mounted like lochinvar and were hard to catch one evening about sundown the rangers halted for supper after a long ride their horses stood panting with their saddles on the men were frying bacon and boiling coffee suddenly out of the brush sebastiano saldar and his gang dashed upon them with blazing six shooters and high voiced yells it was a neat surprise the rangers swore in annoyed tones and got their winchesters busy but the attack was only a spectacular dash of the purest mexican type after the florid demonstration the raiders galloped away yelling down the river the rangers mounted and pursued but in less than two miles the fagged ponies laboured so that lieutenant manning gave the word to abandon the chase and return to the camp then it was discovered that jimmy hayes was missing some one remembered having seen him run for his pony when the attack began but no one had set eyes on him since morning came but no jimmy they searched the country around on the theory that he had been killed or wounded but without success then they followed after saldar s gang but it seemed to have disappeared manning concluded that the wily mexican had recrossed the river after his theatric farewell and indeed no further depredations f rom him were reported this gave the rangers time to nurse a soreness they had as has been said the pride and honour of the company is the individual bravery of its members and now they believed that jimmy hayes had turned coward at the whiz of mexican bullets there was no other deduction buck davis pointed out that not a shot was fired by saldar s gang after jimmy was seen running for his horse there was no way for him to have been shot no he had fled from his first fight and afterward he would not return aware that the scorn of his comrades would be a worse thing to face than the muzzles of many rifles so manning s detachment of mclean s company frontier battalion was gloomy it was the first blot on its escutcheon never before in the history of the service had a ranger shown the white feather all of them had liked jimmy hayes and that made it worse days weeks and months went by and still that little cloud of unforgotten cowardice hung above the camp iii nearly a year afterward after many camping grounds and many hundreds of miles guarded and defended lieutenant manning with almost the same detachment of men was sent to a point only a few miles below their old camp on the river to look after some smuggling there one afternoon while they were riding through a dense mesquite flat they came upon a patch of open hog wallow prairie there they rode upon the scene of an unwritten tragedy in a big hog wallow lay the skeletons of three mexicans their clothing alone served to identify them the largest of the figures had once been sebastiano saldar his great costly sombrero heavy with gold ornamentation a hat famous all along the rio grande lay there pierced by three bullets along the ridge of the hog wallow rested the rusting winchesters of the mexicans all pointing in the same direction the rangers rode in that direction for fifty yards there in a little depression of the ground with his rifle still bearing upon the three lay another skeleton it had been a battle of extermination there was nothing to identify the solitary defender his clothing such as the elements had left distinguishable seemed to be of the kind that any ranchman or cowboy might have worn some cow puncher said manning that they caught out alone good boy he put up a dandy scrap before they got him so that s why we didn t hear from don sebastiano any more and then from beneath the weather beaten rags of the dead man there wriggled out a horned frog with a faded red ribbon around its neck and sat upon the shoulder of its long quiet master mutely it told the story of the untried youth and the swift paint pony how they had outstripped all their comrades that day in the pursuit of the mexican raiders and how the boy had gone down upholding the honour of the company the ranger troop herded close and a simultaneous wild yell arose from their lips the outburst was at once a dirge an apology an epitaph and a paean of triumph a strange requiem you may say over the body of a fallen comrade but if jimmy hayes could have heard it he would have understood the door of unrest i sat an hour by sun in the editor s room of the montopolis weekly bugle i was the editor the saffron rays of the declining sunlight filtered through the cornstalks in micajah widdup s garden patch and cast an amber glory upon my paste pot i sat at the editorial desk in my non rotary revolving chair and prepared my editorial against the oligarchies the room with its one window was already a prey to the twilight one by one with my trenchant sentences i lopped off the heads of the political hydra while i listened full of kindly peace to the home coming cow bells and wondered what mrs flanagan was going to have for supper then in from the dusky quiet street there drifted and perched himself upon a corner of my desk old father time s younger brother his face was beardless and as gnarled as an english walnut i never saw clothes such as he wore they would have reduced joseph s coat to a monochrome but the colours were not the dyer s stains and patches and the work of sun and rust were responsible for the diversity on his coarse shoes was the dust conceivably of a thousand leagues i can describe him no further except to say that he was little and weird and old old i began to estimate in centuries when i saw him yes and i remember that there was an odour a faint odour like aloes or possibly like myrrh or leather and i thought of museums and then i reached for a pad and pencil for business is business and visits of the oldest inhabitants are sacred and honourable requiring to be chronicled i am glad to see you sir i said i would offer you a chair but you see sir i went on i have lived in montopolis only three weeks and i have not met many of our citizens i turned a doubtful eye upon his dust stained shoes and concluded with a newspaper phrase i suppose that you reside in our midst my visitor fumbled in his raiment drew forth a soiled card and handed it to me upon it was written in plain but unsteadily formed characters the name michob ader i am glad you called mr ader i said as one of our older citizens you must view with pride the recent growth and enterprise of montopolis among other improvements i think i can promise that the town will now be provided with a live enterprising newspa do ye know the name on that card asked my caller interrupting me it is not a familiar one to me i said again he visited the depths of his ancient vestments this time he brought out a torn leaf of some book or journal brown and flimsy with age the heading of the page was the turkish spy in old style type the printing upon it was this there is a man come to paris in this year who pretends to have lived these sixteen hundred years he says of himself that he was a shoemaker in jerusalem at the time of the crucifixion that his name is michob ader and that when jesus the christian messias was condemned by pontius pilate the roman president he paused to rest while bearing his cross to the place of crucifixion before the door of michob ader the shoemaker struck jesus with his fist saying go why tarriest thou the messias a nswered him i indeed am going but thou shalt tarry until i come thereby condemning him to live until the day of judgment he lives forever but at the end of every hundred years he falls into a fit or trance on recovering from which he finds himself in the same state of youth in which he was when jesus suffered being then about thirty years of age such is the story of the wandering jew as told by michob ader who relates here the printing ended i must have muttered aloud something to myself about the wandering jew for the old man spake up bitterly and loudly tis a lie said he like nine tenths of what ye call history tis a gentile i am and no jew i am after footing it out of jerusalem my son but if that makes me a jew then everything that comes out of a bottle is babies milk ye have my name on the card ye hold and ye have read the bit of paper they call the turkish spy that printed the news when i stepped into their office on the th day of june in the year just as i have called upon ye to day i laid down my pencil and pad clearly it would not do here was an item for the local column of the bugle that but it would not do still fragments of the impossible personal began to flit through my conventionalized brain uncle michob is as spry on his legs as a young chap of only a thousand or so our venerable caller relates with pride that george wash no ptolemy the great once dandled him on his knee at his father s house uncle michob says that our wet spring was nothing in comparison with the dampness that ruined the crops around mount ararat when he was a boy but no no it would not do i was trying to think of some conversational subject with which to interest my visitor and was hesitating between walking matches and the pliocene age when the old man suddenly began to weep poignantly and distressfully cheer up mr ader i said a little awkwardly this matter may blow over in a few hundred years more there has already been a decided reaction in favour of judas iscariot and colonel burr and the celebrated violinist signor nero this is the age of whitewash you must not allow yourself to become down hearted unknowingly i had struck a chord the old man blinked belligerently through his senile tears tis time he said that the liars be doin justice to somebody yer historians are no more than a pack of old women gabblin at a wake a finer man than the imperor nero niver wore sandals man i was at the burnin of rome i knowed the imperor well for in them days i was a well known char acter in thim days they had rayspect for a man that lived forever but twas of the imperor nero i was goin to tell ye i struck into rome up the appian way on the night of july the th the year i had just stepped down by way of siberia and afghanistan and one foot of me had a frost bite and the other a blister burned by the sand of the desert and i was feelin a bit blue from doin patrol duty from the north pole down to the last chance corner in patagonia and bein miscalled a jew in the bargain well i m tellin ye i was passin the circus maximus and it was dark as pitch over the way and then i heard somebody sing out is that you michob over ag inst the wall hid out amongst a pile of barrels and old dry goods boxes was the imperor nero wid his togy wrapped around his toes smokin a long black segar have one michob says he none of the weeds for me says i nayther pipe nor segar what s the use says i of smokin when ye ve not got the ghost of a chance of killin yeself by doin it true for ye michob ader my perpetual jew says the imperor ye re not always wandering sure tis danger gives the spice of our pleasures next to their bein forbidden and for what says i do ye smoke be night in dark places widout even a cinturion in plain clothes to attend ye have ye ever heard michob says the imperor of predestinarianism i ve had the cousin of it says i i ve been on the trot with pedestrianism for many a year and more to come as ye well know the longer word says me friend nero is the tachin of this new sect of people they call the christians tis them that s raysponsible for me smokin be night in holes and corners of the dark and then i sets down and takes off a shoe and rubs me foot that is frosted and the imperor tells me about it it seems that since i passed that way before the imperor had mandamused the impress wid a divorce suit and misses poppaea a cilibrated lady was ingaged widout riferences as housekeeper at the palace all in one day says the imperor she puts up new lace windy curtains in the palace and joins the anti tobacco society and whin i feels the need of a smoke i must be after sneakin out to these piles of lumber in the dark so there in the dark me and the imperor sat and i told him of me travels and when they say the imperor was an incindiary they lie twas that night the fire started that burnt the city tis my opinion that it began from a stump of segar that he threw down among the boxes and tis a lie that he fiddled he did all he could for six days to stop it sir and now i detected a new flavour to mr michob ader it had not been myrrh or balm or hyssop that i had smelled the emanation was the odour of bad whiskey and worse still of low comedy the sort that small humorists manufacture by clothing the grave and reverend things of legend and history in the vulgar topical frippery that passes for a certain kind of wit michob ader as an impostor claiming nineteen hundred years and playing his part with the decency of respectable lunacy i could endure but as a tedious wag cheapening his egregious story with song book levity his importance as an entertainer grew less and then as if he suspected my thoughts he suddenly shifted his key you ll excuse me sir he whined but sometimes i get a little mixed in my head i am a very old man and it is hard to remember everything i knew that he was right and that i should not try to reconcile him with roman history so i asked for news concerning other ancients with whom he had walked familiar above my desk hung an engraving of raphael s cherubs you could yet make out their forms though the dust blurred their outlines strangely ye calls them cher rubs cackled the old man babes ye fancy they are with wings and there s one wid legs and a bow and arrow that ye call cupid i know where they was found the great great great grandfather of thim all was a billy goat bein an editor sir do ye happen to know where solomon s temple stood i fancied that it was in in persia well i did not know tis not in history nor in the bible where it was but i saw it meself the first pictures of cher rubs and cupids was sculptured upon thim walls and pillars two of the biggest sir stood in the adytum to form the baldachin over the ark but the wings of thim sculptures was intindid for horns and the faces was the faces of goats ten thousand goats there was in and about the temple and your cher rubs was billy goats in the days of king solomon but the painters misconstrued the horns into wings and i knew tamerlane the lame timour sir very well i saw him at keghut and at zaranj he was a little man no larger than yerself with hair the colour of an amber pipe stem they buried him at samarkand i was at the wake sir oh he was a fine built man in his coffin six feet long with black whiskers to his face and i see em throw turnips at the imperor vispacian in africa all over the world i have tramped sir without the body of me findin any rest twas so commanded i saw jerusalem destroyed and pompeii go up in the fireworks and i was at the coronation of charlemagne and the lynchin of joan of arc and everywhere i go there comes storms and revolutions and plagues and fires twas so commanded ye have heard of the wandering jew tis all so except that divil a bit am i a jew but history lies as i have told ye are ye quite sure sir that ye haven t a drop of whiskey convenient ye well know that i have many miles of walking before me i have none said i and if you please i am about to leave for my supper i pushed my chair back creakingly this ancient landlubber was becoming as great an affliction as any cross bowed mariner he shook a musty effluvium from his piebald clothes overturned my inkstand and went on with his insufferable nonsense i wouldn t mind it so much he complained if it wasn t for the work i must do on good fridays ye know about pontius pilate sir of course his body whin he killed himself was pitched into a lake on the alps mountains now listen to the job that tis mine to perform on the night of ivery good friday the ould divil goes down in the pool and drags up pontius and the water is bilin and spewin like a wash pot and the ould divil sets the body on top of a throne on the rocks and thin comes me share of the job oh sir ye would pity me thin ye would pray for the poor wandering jew that niver was a jew if ye could see the horror of the thing that i must do tis i that must fetch a bowl of water and kneel down before it till it washes its hands i declare to ye that pontius pilate a man dead two hundred years dragged up with the lake slime coverin him and fishes wrigglin inside of him widout eyes and in the discomposition of the body sits there sir and washes his hands in the bowl i hold for him on good fridays twas so commanded clearly the matter had progressed far beyond the scope of the bugle s local column there might have been employment here for the alienist or for those who circulate the pledge but i had had enough of it i got up and repeated that i must go at this he seized my coat grovelled upon my desk and burst again into distressful weeping whatever it was about i said to myself that his grief was genuine come now mr ader i said soothingly what is the matter the answer came brokenly through his racking sobs because i would not let the poor christ rest upon the step his hallucination seemed beyond all reasonable answer yet the effect of it upon him scarcely merited disrespect but i knew nothing that might assuage it and i told him once more that both of us should be leaving the office at once obedient at last he raised himself from my dishevelled desk and permitted me to half lift him to the floor the gale of his grief had blown away his words his freshet of tears had soaked away the crust of his grief reminiscence died in him at least the coherent part of it twas me that did it he muttered as i led him toward the door me the shoemaker of jerusalem i got him to the sidewalk and in the augmented light i saw that his face was seared and lined and warped by a sadness almost incredibly the product of a single lifetime and then high up in the firmamental darkness we heard the clamant cries of some great passing birds my wandering jew lifted his hand with side tilted head the seven whistlers he said as one introduces well known friends wild geese said i but i confess that their number is beyond me they follow me everywhere he said twas so commanded what ye hear is the souls of the seven jews that helped with the crucifixion sometimes they re plovers and sometimes geese but ye ll find them always flyin where i go i stood uncertain how to take my leave i looked down the street shuffled my feet looked back again and felt my hair rise the old man had disappeared and then my capillaries relaxed for i dimly saw him footing it away through the darkness but he walked so swiftly and silently and contrary to the gait promised by his age that my composure was not all restored though i knew not why that night i was foolish enough to take down some dust covered volumes from my modest shelves i searched hermippus redivvus and salathiel and the pepys collection in vain and then in a book called the citizen of the world and in one two centuries old i came upon what i desired michob ader had indeed come to paris in the year and related to the turkish spy an extraordinary story he claimed to be the wandering jew and that but here i fell asleep for my editorial duties had not been light that day judge hoover was the bugle s candidate for congress having to confer with him i sought his home early the next morning and we walked together down town through a little street with which i was unfamiliar did you ever hear of michob ader i asked him smiling why yes said the judge and that reminds me of my shoes he has for mending here is his shop now judge hoover stepped into a dingy small shop i looked up at the sign and saw mike o bader boot and shoe maker on it some wild geese passed above honking clearly i scratched my ear and frowned and then trailed into the shop there sat my wandering jew on his shoemaker s bench trimming a half sole he was drabbled with dew grass stained unkempt and miserable and on his face was still the unexplained wretchedness the problematic sorrow the esoteric woe that had been written there by nothing less it seemed than the stylus of the centuries judge hoover inquired kindly concerning his shoes the old shoemaker looked up and spoke sanely enough he had been ill he said for a few days the next day the shoes would be ready he looked at me and i could see that i had no place in his memory so out we went and on our way old mike remarked the candidate has been on one of his sprees he gets crazy drunk regularly once a month but he s a good shoemaker what is his history i inquired whiskey epitomized judge hoover that explains him i was silent but i did not accept the explanation and so when i had the chance i asked old man sellers who browsed daily on my exchanges mike o bader said he was makin shoes in montopolis when i come here goin on fifteen year ago i guess whiskey s his trouble once a month he gets off the track and stays so a week he s got a rigmarole somethin about his bein a jew pedler that he tells ev rybody nobody won t listen to him any more when he s sober he ain t sich a fool he s got a sight of books in the back room of his shop that he reads i guess you can lay all his trouble to whiskey but again i would not not yet was my wandering jew rightly construed for me i trust that women may not be allowed a title to all the curiosity in the world so when montopolis s oldest inhabitant some ninety score years younger than michob ader dropped in to acquire promulgation in print i siphoned his perpetual trickle of reminiscence in the direction of the uninterpreted maker of shoes uncle abner was the complete history of montopolis bound in butternut o bader he quavered come here in he was the first shoemaker in the place folks generally considers him crazy at times now but he don t harm nobody i s pose drinkin upset his mind yes drinkin very likely done it it s a powerful bad thing drinkin i m an old old man sir and i never see no good in drinkin i felt disappointment i was willing to admit drink in the case of my shoemaker but i preferred it as a recourse instead of a cause why had he pitched upon his perpetual strange note of the wandering jew why his unutterable grief during his aberration i could not yet accept whiskey as an explanation did mike o bader ever have a great loss or trouble of any kind i asked lemme see about thirty year ago there was somethin of the kind i recollect montopolis sir in them days used to be a mighty strict place well mike o bader had a daughter then a right pretty girl she was too gay a sort for montopolis so one day she slips off to another town and runs away with a circus it was two years before she comes back all fixed up in fine clothes and rings and jewellery to see mike he wouldn t have nothin to do with her so she stays around town awhile anyway i reckon the men folks wouldn t have raised no objections but the women egged em on to order her to leave town but she had plenty of spunk and told em to mind their own business so one night they decided to run her away a crowd of men and women drove her out of her house and chased her with sticks and stones she run to her father s door callin for help mike opens it and when he sees who it is he hits her with his fist and knocks her down and shuts the door and then the crowd kept on chunkin her till she run clear out of town and the next day they finds her drowned dead in hunter s mill pond i mind it all now that was thirty year ago i leaned back in my non rotary revolving chair and nodded gently like a mandarin at my paste pot when old mike has a spell went on uncle abner tepidly garrulous he thinks he s the wanderin jew he is said i nodding away and uncle abner cackled insinuatingly at the editor s remark for he was expecting at least a stickful in the personal notes of the bugle the duplicity of hargraves when major pendleton talbot of mobile sir and his daughter miss lydia talbot came to washington to reside they selected for a boarding place a house that stood fifty yards back from one of the quietest avenues it was an old fashioned brick building with a portico upheld by tall white pillars the yard was shaded by stately locusts and elms and a catalpa tree in season rained its pink and white blossoms upon the grass rows of high box bushes lined the fence and walks it was the southern style and aspect of the place that pleased the eyes of the talbots in this pleasant private boarding house they engaged rooms including a study for major talbot who was adding the finishing chapters to his book anecdotes and reminiscences of the alabama army bench and bar major talbot was of the old old south the present day had little interest or excellence in his eyes his mind lived in that period before the civil war when the talbots owned thousands of acres of fine cotton land and the slaves to till them when the family mansion was the scene of princely hospitality and drew its guests from the aristocracy of the south out of that period he had brought all its old pride and scruples of honour an antiquated and punctilious politeness and you would think its wardrobe such clothes were surely never made within fifty years the major was tall but whenever he made that wonderful archaic genuflexion he called a bow the corners of his frock coat swept the floor that garment was a surprise even to washington which has long ago ceased to shy at the frocks and broadbrimmed hats of southern congressmen one of the boarders christened it a father hubbard and it certainly was high in the waist and full in the skirt but the major with all his queer clothes his immense area of plaited ravelling shirt bosom and the little black string tie with the bow always slipping on one side both was smiled at and liked in mrs vardeman s select boarding house some of the young department clerks would often string him as they called it getting him started upon the subject dearest to him the traditions and history of his beloved southland during his talks he would quote freely from the anecdotes and reminiscences but they were very careful not to let him see their designs for in spite of his sixty eight years he could make the boldest of them uncomfortable under the steady regard of his piercing gray eyes miss lydia was a plump little old maid of thirty five with smoothly drawn tightly twisted hair that made her look still older old fashioned too she was but ante bellum glory did not radiate from her as it did from the major she possessed a thrifty common sense and it was she who handled the finances of the family and met all comers when there were bills to pay the major regarded board bills and wash bills as contemptible nuisances they kept coming in so persistently and so often why the major wanted to know could they not be filed and paid in a lump sum at some convenient period say when the anecdotes and reminiscences had been published and paid for miss lydia would calmly go on with her sewing and say we ll pay as we go as long as the money lasts and then perhaps they ll have to lump it most of mrs vardeman s boarders were away during the day being nearly all department clerks and business men but there was one of them who was about the house a great deal from morning to night this was a young man named henry hopkins hargraves every one in the house addressed him by his full name who was engaged at one of the popular vaudeville theatres vaudeville has risen to such a respectable plane in the last few years and mr hargraves was such a modest and well mannered person that mrs vardeman could find no objection to enrolling him upon her list of boarders at the theatre hargraves was known as an all round dialect comedian having a large repertoire of german irish swede and black face specialties but mr hargraves was ambitious and often spoke of his great desire to succeed in legitimate comedy this young man appeared to conceive a strong fancy for major talbot whenever that gentleman would begin his southern reminiscences or repeat some of the liveliest of the anecdotes hargraves could always be found the most attentive among his listeners for a time the major showed an inclination to discourage the advances of the play actor as he privately termed him but soon the young man s agreeable manner and indubitable appreciation of the old gentleman s stories completely won him over it was not long before the two were like old chums the major set apart each afternoon to read to him the manuscript of his book during the anecdotes hargraves never failed to laugh at exactly the right point the major was moved to declare to miss lydia one day that young hargraves possessed remarkable perception and a gratifying respect for the old regime and when it came to talking of those old days if major talbot liked to talk mr hargraves was entranced to listen like almost all old people who talk of the past the major loved to linger over details in describing the splendid almost royal days of the old planters he would hesitate until he had recalled the name of the negro who held his horse or the exact date of certain minor happenings or the number of bales of cotton raised in such a year but hargraves never grew impatient or lost interest on the contrary he would advance questions on a variety of subjects connected with the life of that time and he n ever failed to extract ready replies the fox hunts the possum suppers the hoe downs and jubilees in the negro quarters the banquets in the plantation house hall when invitations went for fifty miles around the occasional feuds with the neighbouring gentry the major s duel with rathbone culbertson about kitty chalmers who afterward married a thwaite of south carolina and private yacht races for fabulous sums on mobile bay the quaint beliefs improvident habits and loyal virtues of the old slaves all these were subjects that held both the major and hargraves absorbed for hours at a time sometimes at night when the young man would be coming upstairs to his room after his turn at the theatre was over the major would appear at the door of his study and beckon archly to him going in hargraves would find a little table set with a decanter sugar bowl fruit and a big bunch of fresh green mint it occurred to me the major would begin he was always ceremonious that perhaps you might have found your duties at the at your place of occupation sufficiently arduous to enable you mr hargraves to appreciate what the poet might well have had in his mind when he wrote tired nature s sweet restorer one of our southern juleps it was a fascination to hargraves to watch him make it he took rank among artists when he began and he never varied the process with what delicacy he bruised the mint with what exquisite nicety he estimated the ingredients with what solicitous care he capped the compound with the scarlet fruit glowing against the dark green fringe and then the hospitality and grace with which he offered it after the selected oat straws had been plunged into its tinkling depths after about four months in washington miss lydia discovered one morning that they were almost without money the anecdotes and reminiscences was completed but publishers had not jumped at the collected gems of alabama sense and wit the rental of a small house which they still owned in mobile was two months in arrears their board money for the month would be due in three days miss lydia called her father to a consultation no money said he with a surprised look it is quite annoying to be called on so frequently for these petty sums really i the major searched his pockets he found only a two dollar bill which he returned to his vest pocket i must attend to this at once lydia he said kindly get me my umbrella and i will go down town immediately the congressman from our district general fulghum assured me some days ago that he would use his influence to get my book published at an early date i will go to his hotel at once and see what arrangement has been made with a sad little smile miss lydia watched him button his father hubbard and depart pausing at the door as he always did to bow profoundly that evening at dark he returned it seemed that congressman fulghum had seen the publisher who had the major s manuscript for reading that person had said that if the anecdotes etc were carefully pruned down about one half in order to eliminate the sectional and class prejudice with which the book was dyed from end to end he might consider its publication the major was in a white heat of anger but regained his equanimity according to his code of manners as soon as he was in miss lydia s presence we must have money said miss lydia with a little wrinkle above her nose give me the two dollars and i will telegraph to uncle ralph for some to night the major drew a small envelope from his upper vest pocket and tossed it on the table perhaps it was injudicious he said mildly but the sum was so merely nominal that i bought tickets to the theatre to night it s a new war drama lydia i thought you would be pleased to witness its first production in washington i am told that the south has very fair treatment in the play i confess i should like to see the performance myself miss lydia threw up her hands in silent despair still as the tickets were bought they might as well be used so that evening as they sat in the theatre listening to the lively overture even miss lydia was minded to relegate their troubles for the hour to second place the major in spotless linen with his extraordinary coat showing only where it was closely buttoned and his white hair smoothly roached looked really fine and distinguished the curtain went up on the first act of a magnolia flower revealing a typical southern plantation scen e major talbot betrayed some interest oh see exclaimed miss lydia nudging his arm and pointing to her programme the major put on his glasses and read the line in the cast of characters that her finger indicated col webster calhoun h hopkins hargraves it s our mr hargraves said miss lydia it must be his first appearance in what he calls the legitimate i m so glad for him not until the second act did col webster calhoun appear upon the stage when he made his entry major talbot gave an audible sniff glared at him and seemed to freeze solid miss lydia uttered a little ambiguous squeak and crumpled her programme in her hand for colonel calhoun was made up as nearly resembling major talbot as one pea does another the long thin white hair curly at the ends the aristocratic beak of a nose the crumpled wide ravelling shirt front the string tie with the bow nearly under one ear were almost exactly duplicated and then to clinch the imitation he wore the twin to the major s supposed to be unparalleled coat high collared baggy empire waisted ample skirted hanging a foot lower in front than behind the garment could have been designed from no other pattern from then on the major and miss lydia sat bewitched and saw the counterfeit presentment of a haughty talbot dragged as the major afterward expressed it through the slanderous mire of a corrupt st age mr hargraves had used his opportunities well he had caught the major s little idiosyncrasies of speech accent and intonation and his pompous courtliness to perfection exaggerating all to the purposes of the stage when he performed that marvellous bow that the major fondly imagined to be the pink of all salutations the audience sent forth a sudden round of hearty applause miss lydia sat immovable not daring to glance toward her father sometimes her hand next to him would be laid against her cheek as if to conceal the smile which in spite of her disapproval she could not entirely suppress the culmination of hargraves s audacious imitation took place in the third act the scene is where colonel calhoun entertains a few of the neighbouring planters in his den standing at a table in the centre of the stage with his friends grouped about him he delivers that inimitable rambling character monologue so famous in a magnolia flower at the same time that he deftly makes juleps for the party major talbot sitting quietly but white with indignation heard his best stories retold his pet theories and hobbies advanced and expanded and the dream of the anecdotes and reminiscences served exaggerated and garbled his favourite narrative that of his duel with rathbone culbertson was not omitted and it was delivered with more fire egotism and gusto than the major himself put into it the monologue concluded with a quaint delicious witty little lecture on the art of concocting a julep illustrated by the act here major talbot s delicate but showy science was reproduced to a hair s breadth from his dainty handling of the fragrant weed the one thousandth part of a grain too much pressure gentlemen and you extract the bitterness instead of the aroma of this heaven bestowed plant to his solicitous selection of the oaten straws at the close of the scene the audience raised a tumultuous roar of appreciation the portrayal of the type was so exact so sure and thorough that the leading characters in the play were forgotten after repeated calls hargraves came before the curtain and bowed his rather boyish face bright and flushed with the knowledge of success at last miss lydia turned and looked at the major his thin nostrils were working like the gills of a fish he laid both shaking hands upon the arms of his chair to rise we will go lydia he said chokingly this is an abominable desecration before he could rise she pulled him back into his seat we will stay it out she declared do you want to advertise the copy by exhibiting the original coat so they remained to the end hargraves s success must have kept him up late that night for neither at the breakfast nor at the dinner table did he appear about three in the afternoon he tapped at the door of major talbot s study the major opened it and hargraves walked in with his hands full of the morning papers too full of his triumph to notice anything unusual in the major s demeanour i put it all over em last night major he began exultantly i had my inning and i think scored here s what the post says his conception and portrayal of the old time southern colonel with his absurd grandiloquence his eccentric garb his quaint idioms and phrases his moth eaten pride of family and his really kind heart fastidious sense of honour and lovable simplicity is the best delineation of a character role on the boards to day the coat worn by colonel calhoun is itself nothing less than an evolution of genius mr hargraves has captured his public how does that sound major for a first nighter i had the honour the major s voice sounded ominously frigid of witnessing your very remarkable performance sir last night hargraves looked disconcerted you were there i didn t know you ever i didn t know you cared for the theatre oh i say major talbot he exclaimed frankly don t you be offended i admit i did get a lot of pointers from you that helped me out wonderfully in the part but it s a type you know not individual the way the audience caught on shows that half the patrons of that theatre are southerners they recognized it mr hargraves said the major who had remained standing you have put upon me an unpardonable insult you have burlesqued my person grossly betrayed my confidence and misused my hospitality if i thought you possessed the faintest conception of what is the sign manual of a gentleman or what is due one i would call you out sir old as i am i will ask you to leave the room sir the actor appeared to be slightly bewildered and seemed hardly to take in the full meaning of the old gentleman s words i am truly sorry you took offence he said regretfully up here we don t look at things just as you people do i know men who would buy out half the house to have their personality put on the stage so the public would recognize it they are not from alabama sir said the major haughtily perhaps not i have a pretty good memory major let me quote a few lines from your book in response to a toast at a banquet given in milledgeville i believe you uttered and intend to have printed these words the northern man is utterly without sentiment or warmth except in so far as the feelings may be turned to his own commercial profit he will suffer without resentment any imputation cast upon the honour of himself or his loved ones that does not bear with it the consequence of pecuniary loss in his charity he gives with a liberal hand but it must be heralded with the trumpet and chronicled in brass do you think that picture is fairer than the one you saw of colonel calhoun last night the description said the major frowning is not without grounds some exag latitude must be allowed in public speaking and in public acting replied hargraves that is not the point persisted the major unrelenting it was a personal caricature i positively decline to overlook it sir major talbot said hargraves with a winning smile i wish you would understand me i want you to know that i never dreamed of insulting you in my profession all life belongs to me i take what i want and what i can and return it over the footlights now if you will let s let it go at that i came in to see you about something else we ve been pretty good friends for some months and i m going to take the risk of offending you again i know you are hard up for money never mind how i found out a boarding house is no place to keep such matters secret and i want you to let me help you out of the pinch i ve been there often enough myself i ve been getting a fair salary all the season and i ve saved some money you re welcome to a couple hundred or even more until you get stop commanded the major with his arm outstretched it seems that my book didn t lie after all you think your money salve will heal all the hurts of honour under no circumstances would i accept a loan from a casual acquaintance and as to you sir i would starve before i would consider your insulting offer of a financial adjustment of the circumstances we have discussed i beg to repeat my request relative to your quitting the apartment hargraves took his departure without another word he also left the house the same day moving as mrs vardeman explained at the supper table nearer the vicinity of the down town theatre where a magnolia flower was booked for a week s run critical was the situation with major talbot and miss lydia there was no one in washington to whom the major s scruples allowed him to apply for a loan miss lydia wrote a letter to uncle ralph but it was doubtful whether that relative s constricted affairs would permit him to furnish help the major was forced to make an apologetic address to mrs vardeman regarding the delayed payment for board referring to delinquent rentals and delayed remittances in a rather confused strain deliverance came from an entirely unexpected source late one afternoon the door maid came up and announced an old coloured man who wanted to see major talbot the major asked that he be sent up to his study soon an old darkey appeared in the doorway with his hat in hand bowing and scraping with one clumsy foot he was quite decently dressed in a baggy suit of black his big coarse shoes shone with a metallic lustre suggestive of stove polish his bushy wool was gray almost white after middle life it is difficult to estimate the age of a negro this one might have seen as many years as had major talbot i be bound you don t know me mars pendleton were his first words the major rose and came forward at the old familiar style of address it was one of the old plantation darkeys without a doubt but they had been widely scattered and he could not recall the voice or face i don t believe i do he said kindly unless you will assist my memory don t you member cindy s mose mars pendleton what migrated mediately after de war wait a moment said the major rubbing his forehead with the tips of his fingers he loved to recall everything connected with those beloved days cindy s mose he reflected you worked among the horses breaking the colts yes i remember now after

and so was the major something alive and tangible had come to link them with the happy past the three sat and talked over the olden times the major and uncle mose correcting or prompting each other as they reviewed the plantation scenes and days the major inquired what the old man was doing so far from his home uncle mose am a delicate he explained to de grand baptis convention in dis city i never preached none but bein a residin elder in de church and able fur to pay my own expenses dey sent me along and how did you know we were in washington inquired miss lydia dey s a cullud man works in de

better fitted than i to manage its expenditure take it honey said uncle mose hit belongs to you hit s talbot money after uncle mose had gone miss lydia had a good cry for joy and the major turned his face to a corner and smoked his clay pipe volcanically the succeeding days saw the talbots restored to peace and ease miss lydia s face lost its worried look the major appeared in a new frock coat in which he looked like a wax figure personifying the memory of his golden age another publisher who read the manuscript of the anecdotes and reminiscences thought that with a little retouching and toning down of the high lights he could make a really bright and salable volume of it altogether the situation was comfortable and not without the touch of hope that is often sweeter than arrived blessings one day about a week after their piece of good luck a maid brought a letter for miss lydia to her room the postmark showed that it was from new york not knowing any one there miss lydia in a mild flutter of wonder sat down by her table and opened the letter with her scissors this was what she read dear miss talbot i thought you might be glad to learn of my good fortune i have received and accepted an offer of two hundred dollars per week by a new york stock company to play colonel calhoun in a magnolia flower there is something else i wanted you to know i guess you d better not tell major talbot i was anxious to make him some amends for the great help he was to me in studying the part and for the bad humour he was in about it he refused to let me so i did it anyhow i could easily spare the three hundred sincerely yours h hopkins hargraves p s how did i play uncle mose major talbot passing through the hall saw miss lydia s door open and stopped any mail for us this morning lydia dear he asked miss lydia slid the letter beneath a fold of her dress the mobile chronicle came she said promptly it s on the table in your study let me feel your pulse so i went to a doctor how long has it been since you took any alcohol into your system he asked turning my head sidewise i answered oh quite awhile he was a young doctor somewhere between twenty and forty he wore heliotrope socks but he looked like napoleon i liked him immensely now said he i am going to show you the effect of alcohol upon your circulation i think it was circulation he said though it may have been advertising he bared my left arm to the elbow brought out a bottle of whiskey and gave me a drink he began to look more like napoleon i began to like him better then he put a tight compress on my upper arm stopped my pulse with his fingers and squeezed a rubber bulb connected with an apparatus on a stand that looked like a thermometer the mercury jumped up and down without seeming to stop anywhere but the doctor said it registered two hundred and thirty seven or one hundred and sixty five or some such number now said he you see what alcohol does to the blood pressure it s marvellous said i but do you think it a sufficient test have one on me and let s try the other arm but no then he grasped my hand i thought i was doomed and he was saying good bye but all he wanted to do was to jab a needle into the end of a finger and compare the red drop with a lot of fifty cent poker chips that he had fastened to a card it s the haemoglobin test he explained the colour of your blood is wrong well said i i know it should be blue but this is a country of mix ups some of my ancestors were cavaliers but they got thick with some people on nantucket island so i mean said the doctor that the shade of red is too light oh said i it s a case of matching instead of matches the doctor then pounded me severely in the region of the chest when he did that i don t know whether he reminded me most of napoleon or battling or lord nelson then he looked grave and mentioned a string of grievances that the flesh is heir to mostly ending in itis i immediately paid him fifteen dollars on account is or are it or some or any of them necessarily fatal i asked i thought my connection with the matter justified my manifesting a certain amount of interest all of them he answered cheerfully but their progress may be arrested with care and proper continuous treatment you may live to be eighty five or ninety i began to think of the doctor s bill eighty five would be sufficient i am sure was my comment i paid him ten dollars more on account the first thing to do he said with renewed animation is to find a sanitarium where you will get a complete rest for a while and allow your nerves to get into a better condition i myself will go with you and select a suitable one so he took me to a mad house in the catskills it was on a bare mountain frequented only by infrequent frequenters you could see nothing but stones and boulders some patches of snow and scattered pine trees the young physician in charge was most agreeable he gave me a stimulant without applying a compress to the arm it was luncheon time and we were invited to partake there were about twenty inmates at little tables in the dining room the young physician in charge came to our table and said it is a custom with our guests not to regard themselves as patients hut merely as tired ladies and gentlemen taking a rest whatever slight maladies they may have are never alluded to in conversation my doctor called loudly to a waitress to bring some phosphoglycerate of lime hash dog bread bromo seltzer pancakes and nux vomica tea for my repast then a sound arose like a sudden wind storm among pine trees it was produced by every guest in the room whispering loudly neurasthenia except one man with a nose whom i distinctly heard say chronic alcoholism i hope to meet him again the physician in charge turned and walked away an hour or so after luncheon he conducted us to the workshop say fifty yards from the house thither the guests had been conducted by the physician in charge s understudy and sponge holder a man with feet and a blue sweater he was so tall that i was not sure he had a face hut the armour packing company would have been delighted with his hands here said the physician in charge our guests find relaxation from past mental worries by devoting themselves to physical labour recreation in reality there were turning lathes carpenters outfits clay modelling tools spinning wheels weaving frames treadmills bass drums enlarged crayon portrait apparatuses blacksmith forges and everything seemingly that could interest the paying lunatic guests of a first rate sanitarium the lady making mud pies in the corner whispered the physician in charge is no other than lula lulington the authoress of the novel entitled why love loves what she is doing now is simply to rest her mind after performing that piece of work i had seen the book why doesn t she do it by writing another one instead i asked as you see i wasn t as far gone as they thought i was the gentleman pouring water through the funnel continued the physician in charge is a wall street broker broken down from overwork i buttoned my coat others he pointed out were architects playing with noah s arks ministers reading darwin s theory of evolution lawyers sawing wood tired out society ladies talking ibsen to the blue sweatered sponge holder a neurotic millionaire lying asleep on the floor and a prominent artist drawing a little red wagon around the room you look pretty strong said the physician in charge to me i think the best mental relaxation for you would be throwing small boulders over the mountainside and then bringing them up again i was a hundred yards away before my doctor overtook me what s the matter he asked the matter is said i that there are no aeroplanes handy so i am going to merrily and hastily jog the foot pathway to yon station and catch the first unlimited soft coal express back to town well said the doctor perhaps you are right this seems hardly the suitable place for you but what you need is rest absolute rest and exercise that night i went to a hotel in the city and said to the clerk what i need is absolute rest and exercise can you give me a room with one of those tall folding beds in it and a relay of bellboys to work it up and down while i rest the clerk rubbed a speck off one of his finger nails and glanced sidewise at a tall man in a white hat sitting in the lobby that man came over and asked me politely if i had seen the shrubbery at the west entrance i had not so he showed it to me and then looked me over i thought you had em he said not unkindly but i guess you re all right you d better go see a doctor old man a week afterward my doctor tested my blood pressure again without the preliminary stimulant he looked to me a little less like napoleon and his socks were of a shade of tan that did not appeal to me what you need he decided is sea air and companionship would a mermaid i began but he slipped on his professional manner i myself he said will take you to the hotel bonair off the coast of long island and see that you get in good shape it is a quiet comfortable resort where you will soon recuperate the hotel bonair proved to be a nine hundred room fashionable hostelry on an island off the main shore everybody who did not dress for dinner was shoved into a side dining room and given only a terrapin and champagne table d hote the bay was a great stamping ground for wealthy yachtsmen the corsair anchored there the day we arrived i saw mr morgan standing on deck eating a cheese sandwich and gazing longingly at the hotel still it was a very inexpensive place nobody could afford to pay their p rices when you went away you simply left your baggage stole a skiff and beat it for the mainland in the night when i had been there one day i got a pad of monogrammed telegraph blanks at the clerk s desk and began to wire to all my friends for get away money my doctor and i played one game of croquet on the golf links and went to sleep on the lawn when we got back to town a thought seemed to occur to him suddenly by the way he asked how do you feel relieved of very much i replied now a consulting physician is different he isn t exactly sure whether he is to be paid or not and this uncertainty insures you either the most careful or the most careless attention my doctor took me to see a consulting physician he made a poor guess and gave me careful attention i liked him immensely he put me through some coordination exercises have you a pain in the back of your head he asked i told him i had not shut your eyes he ordered put your feet close together and jump backward as far as you can i always was a good backward jumper with my eyes shut so i obeyed my head struck the edge of the bathroom door which had been left open and was only three feet away the doctor was very sorry he had overlooked the fact that the door was open he closed it now touch your nose with your right forefinger he said where is it i asked on your face said he i mean my right forefinger i explained oh excuse me said he he reopened the bathroom door and i took my finger out of the crack of it after i had performed the marvellous digito nasal feat i said i do not wish to deceive you as to symptoms doctor i really have something like a pain in the back of my head he ignored the symptom and examined my heart carefully with a latest popular air penny in the slot ear trumpet i felt like a ballad now he said gallop like a horse for about five minutes around the room i gave the best imitation i could of a disqualified percheron being led out of madison square garden then without dropping in a penny he listened to my chest again no glanders in our family doc i said the consulting physician held up his forefinger within three inches of my nose look at my finger he commanded did you ever try pears i began but he went on with his test rapidly now look across the bay at my finger across the bay at my finger at my finger across the bay across the bay at my finger across the bay this for about three minutes he explained that this was a test of the action of the brain it seemed easy to me i never once mistook his finger for the bay i ll bet that if he had used the phrases gaze as it were unpreoccupied outward or rather laterally in the direction of the horizon underlaid so to speak with the adjacent fluid inlet and now returning or rather in a manner withdrawing your attention bestow it upon my upraised digit i ll bet i say that henry james himself could have passed the exami nation after asking me if i had ever had a grand uncle with curvature of the spine or a cousin with swelled ankles the two doctors retired to the bathroom and sat on the edge of the bath tub for their consultation i ate an apple and gazed first at my finger and then across the bay the doctors came out looking grave more they looked tombstones and tennessee papers please copy they wrote out a diet list to which i was to be restricted it had everything that i had ever heard of to eat on it except snails and i never eat a snail unless it overtakes me and bites me first you must follow this diet strictly said the doctors i d follow it a mile if i could get one tenth of what s on it i answered of next importance they went on is outdoor air and exercise and here is a prescription that will be of great benefit to you then all of us took something they took their hats and i took my departure i went to a druggist and showed him the prescription it will be for an ounce bottle he said will you give me a piece of your wrapping cord said i i made a hole in the prescription ran the cord through it tied it around my neck and tucked it inside all of us have a little superstition and mine runs to a confidence in amulets of course there was nothing the matter with me but i was very ill i couldn t work sleep eat or bowl the only way i could get any sympathy was to go without shaving for four days even then somebody would say old man you look as hardy as a pine knot been up for a jaunt in the maine woods eh then suddenly i remembered that i must have outdoor air and exercise so i went down south to john s john is an approximate relative by verdict of a preacher standing with a little book in his hands in a bower of chrysanthemums while a hundred thousand people looked on john has a country house seven miles from pineville it is at an altitude and on the blue ridge mountains in a state too dignified to be dragged into this controversy john is mica which is more valuable and clearer than gold he met me at pineville and we took the trolley car to his home it is a big neighbourless cottage on a hill surrounded by a hundred mountains we got off at his little private station where john s family and amaryllis met and greeted us amaryllis looked at me a trifle anxiously a rabbit came bounding across the hill between us and the house i threw down my suit case and pursued it hotfoot after i had run twenty yards and seen it disappear i sat down on the grass and wept disconsolately i can t catch a rabbit any more i sobbed i m of no further use in the world i may as well be dead oh what is it what is it brother john i heard amaryllis say nerves a little unstrung said john in his calm way don t worry get up you rabbit chaser and come on to the house before the biscuits get cold it was about twilight and the mountains came up nobly to miss murfree s descriptions of them soon after dinner i announced that i believed i could sleep for a year or two including legal holidays so i was shown to a room as big and cool as a flower garden where there was a bed as broad as a lawn soon afterward the remainder of the household retired and then there fell upon the land a silence i had not heard a silence before in years it was absolute i raised myself on my elbow and listened to it sleep i thought that if i only could hear a star twinkle or a blade of grass sharpen itself i could compose myself to rest i thought once that i heard a sound like the sail of a catboat flapping as it veered about in a breeze but i decided that it was probably only a tack in the carpet still i listened suddenly some belated little bird alighted upon the window sill and in what he no doubt considered sleepy tones enunciated the noise generally translated as cheep i leaped into the air hey what s the matter down there called john from his room above mine oh nothing i answered except that i accidentally bumped my head against the ceiling the next morning i went out on the porch and looked at the mountains there were forty seven of them in sight i shuddered went into the big hall sitting room of the house selected pancoast s family practice of medicine from a bookcase and began to read john came in took the book away from me and led me outside he has a farm of three hundred acres furnished with the usual complement of barns mules peasantry and harrows with three front teeth broken off i had seen such things in my childhood and my heart began to sink then john spoke of alfalfa and i brightened at once oh yes said i wasn t she in the chorus of let s see green you know said john and tender and you plow it under after the first season i know said i and the grass grows over her right said john you know something about farming after all i know something of some farmers said i and a sure scythe will mow them down some day on the way back to the house a beautiful and inexplicable creature walked across our path i stopped irresistibly fascinated gazing at it john waited patiently smoking his cigarette he is a modern farmer after ten minutes he said are you going to stand there looking at that chicken all day breakfast is nearly ready a chicken said i a white orpington hen if you want to particularize a white orpington hen i repeated with intense interest the fowl walked slowly away with graceful dignity and i followed like a child after the pied piper five minutes more were allowed me by john and then he took me by the sleeve and conducted me to breakfast after i had been there a week i began to grow alarmed i was sleeping and eating well and actually beginning to enjoy life for a man in my desperate condition that would never do so i sneaked down to the trolley car station took the car for pineville and went to see one of the best physicians in town by this time i knew exactly what to do when i needed medical treatment i hung my hat on the back of a chair and said rapidly doctor i have cirrhosis of the heart indurated arteries neurasthenia neuritis acute indigestion and convalescence i am going to live on a strict diet i shall also take a tepid bath at night and a cold one in the morning i shall endeavour to be cheerful and fix my mind on pleasant subjects in the way of drugs i intend to take a phosphorous pill three times a day preferably after meals and a tonic composed of the tinctures of gentian cinchona calisaya and cardamom compound into each teaspoonful of this i shall mix tincture of nux vomica beginning with one drop and increasing it a drop each day until the maximum dose is reached i shall drop this with a medicine dropper which can be procured at a trifling cost at any pharmacy good morning i took my hat and walked out after i had closed the door i remembered something that i had forgotten to say i opened it again the doctor had not moved from where he had been sitting but he gave a slightly nervous start when he saw me again i forgot to mention said i that i shall also take absolute rest and exercise after this consultation i felt much better the reestablishing in my mind of the fact that i was hopelessly ill gave me so much satisfaction that i almost became gloomy again there is nothing more alarming to a neurasthenic than to feel himself growing well and cheerful john looked after me carefully after i had evinced so much interest in his white orpington chicken he tried his best to divert my mind and was particular to lock his hen house of nights gradually the tonic mountain air the wholesome food and the daily walks among the hills so alleviated my malady that i became utterly wretched and despondent i heard of a country doctor who lived in the mountains nearby i went to see him and told him the whole story he was a gray bearded man with clear blue wr inkled eyes in a home made suit of gray jeans in order to save time i diagnosed my case touched my nose with my right forefinger struck myself below the knee to make my foot kick sounded my chest stuck out my tongue and asked him the price of cemetery lots in pineville he lit his pipe and looked at me for about three minutes brother he said after a while you are in a mighty bad way there s a chance for you to pull through but it s a mighty slim one what can it be i asked eagerly i have taken arsenic and gold phosphorus exercise nux vomica hydrotherapeutic baths rest excitement codein and aromatic spirits of ammonia is there anything left in the pharmacopoeia somewhere in these mountains said the doctor there s a plant growing a flowering plant that ll cure you and it s about the only thing that will it s of a kind that s as old as the world but of late it s powerful scarce and hard to find you and i will have to hunt it up i m not engaged in active practice now i m getting along in years but i ll take your case you ll have to come every day in the afternoon and help me hunt for this plant till we find it the city doctors may know a lot about new scientific things but they don t know much about the cures that nature carries around in her saddlebags so every day the old doctor and i hunted the cure all plant among the mountains and valleys of the blue ridge together we toiled up steep heights so slippery with fallen autumn leaves that we had to catch every sapling and branch within our reach to save us from falling we waded through gorges and chasms breast deep with laurel and ferns we followed the banks of mountain streams for miles we wound our way like indians through brakes of pine road side hill side river side mountain side we explored in our search for the miraculous plant as the old doctor said it must have grown scarce and hard to find but we followed our quest day by day we plumbed the valleys scaled the heights and tramped the plateaus in search of the miraculous plant mountain bred he never seemed to tire i often reached home too fatigued to do anything except fall into bed and sleep until morning this we kept up for a month one evening after i had returned from a six mile tramp with the old doctor amaryllis and i took a little walk under the trees near the road we looked at the mountains drawing their royal purple robes around them for their night s repose i m glad you re well again she said when you first came you frightened me i thought you were really ill well again i almost shrieked do you know that i have only one chance in a thousand to live amaryllis looked at me in surprise why said she you are as strong as one of the plough mules you sleep ten or twelve hours every night and you are eating us out of house and home what more do you want i tell you said i that unless we find the magic that is the plant we are looking for in time nothing can save me the doctor tells me so what doctor doctor tatum the old doctor who lives halfway up black oak mountain do you know him i have known him since i was able to talk and is that where you go every day is it he who takes you on these long walks and climbs that have brought back your health and strength god bless the old doctor just then the old doctor himself drove slowly down the road in his rickety old buggy i waved my hand at him and shouted that i would be on hand the next day at the usual time he stopped his horse and called to amaryllis to come out to him they talked for five minutes while i waited then the old doctor drove on when we got to the house amaryllis lugged out an encyclopaedia and sought a word in it the doctor said she told me that you needn t call any more as a patient but he d be glad to see you any time as a friend and then he told me to look up my name in the encyclopaedia and tell you what it means it seems to be the name of a genus of flowering plants and also the name of a country girl in theocritus and virgil what do you suppose the doctor meant by that i know what he meant said i i know now a word to a brother who may have come under the spell of the unquiet lady neurasthenia the formula was true even though gropingly at times the physicians of the walled cities had put their fingers upon the specific medicament and so for the exercise one is referred to good doctor tatum on black oak mountain take the road to your right at the methodist meeting house in the pine grove absolute rest and exercise what rest more remedial than to sit with amaryllis in the shade and with a sixth sense read the wordless theocritan idyl of the gold bannered blue mountains marching orderly into the dormitories of the night october and june the captain gazed gloomily at his sword that hung upon the wall in the closet near by was stored his faded uniform stained and worn by weather and service what a long long time it seemed since those old days of war s alarms and now veteran that he was of his country s strenuous times he had been reduced to abject surrender by a woman s soft eyes and smiling lips as he sat in his quiet room he held in his hand the letter he had just received from her the letter that had caused him to wear that look of gloom he re read the fatal paragraph that had destroyed his hope in declining the honour you have done me in asking me to be your wife i feel that i ought to speak frankly the reason i have for so doing is the great difference between our ages i like you very very much but i am sure that our marriage would not be a happy one i am sorry to have to refer to this but i believe that you will appreciate my honesty in giving you the true reason the captain sighed and leaned his head upon his hand yes there were many years between their ages but he was strong and rugged he had position and wealth would not his love his tender care and the advantages he could bestow upon her make her forget the question of age besides he was almost sure that she cared for him the captain was a man of prompt action in the field he had been distinguished for his decisiveness and energy he would see her and plead his cause again in person age what was it to come between him and the one he loved in two hours he stood ready in light marching order for his greatest battle he took the train for the old southern town in tennessee where she lived theodora deming was on the steps of the handsome porticoed old mansion enjoying the summer twilight when the captain entered the gate and came up the gravelled walk she met him with a smile that was free from embarrassment as the captain stood on the step below her the difference in their ages did not appear so great he was tall and straight and clear eyed and browned she was in the bloom of lovely womanhood i wasn t expecting you said theodora but now that you ve come you may sit on the step didn t you get my letter i did said the captain and that s why i came i say now theo reconsider your answer won t you theodora smiled softly upon him he carried his years well she was really fond of his strength his wholesome looks his manliness perhaps if no no she said shaking her head positively it s out of the question i like you a whole lot but marrying won t do my age and yours are but don t make me say it again i told you in my letter the captain flushed a little through the bronze on his face he was silent for a while gazing sadly into the twilight beyond a line of woods that he could see was a field where the boys in blue had once bivouacked on their march toward the sea how long ago it seemed now truly fate and father time had tricked him sorely just a few years interposed between himself and happiness theodora s hand crept down and rested in the clasp of his firm brown one she felt at least that sentiment that is akin to love don t take it so hard please she said gently it s all for the best i ve reasoned it out very wisely all by myself some day you ll be glad i didn t marry you it would be very nice and lovely for a while but just think in only a few short years what different tastes we would have one of us would want to sit by the fireside and read and maybe nurse neuralgia or rheumatism of evenings while the other would be crazy for balls and theatres and late suppers no my dear friend while it isn t exactly january and may it s a clear case of october and pretty early in june i d always do what you wanted me to do theo if you wanted to no you wouldn t you think now that you would but you wouldn t please don t ask me any more the captain had lost his battle but he was a gallant warrior and when he rose to make his final adieu his mouth was grimly set and his shoulders were squared he took the train for the north that night on the next evening he was back in his room where his sword was hanging against the wall he was dressing for dinner tying his white tie into a very careful bow and at the same time he was indulging in a pensive soliloquy pon my honour i believe theo was right after all nobody can deny that she s a peach but she must be twenty eight at the very kindest calculation for you see the captain was only nineteen and his sword had never been drawn except on the parade ground at chattanooga which was as near as he ever got to the spanish american war the church with an overshot wheel lakelands is not to be found in the catalogues of fashionable summer resorts it lies on a low spur of the cumberland range of mountains on a little tributary of the clinch river lakelands proper is a contented village of two dozen houses situated on a forlorn narrow gauge railroad line you wonder whether the railroad lost itself in the pine woods and ran into lakelands from fright and loneliness or whether lakelands got lost and huddled itself along the railroad to wait for the ears to carry it home you wonder again why it was named lakelands there are no lakes and the lands about are too poor to be worth mentioning half a mile from the village stands the eagle house a big roomy old mansion run by josiah rankin for the accommodation of visitors who desire the mountain air at inexpensive rates the eagle house is delightfully mismanaged it is full of ancient instead of modern improvements and it is altogether as comfortably neglected and pleasingly disarranged as your own home but you are furnished with clean rooms and good and abundant fare yourself and the piny woods must do the rest nature has provided a mineral spring grape vine swings and croquet even the wickets are wooden you have art to thank only for the fiddle and guitar music twice a week at the hop in the rustic pavilion the patrons of the eagle house are those who seek recreation as a necessity as well as a pleasure they are busy people who may be likened to clocks that need a fortnight s winding to insure a year s running of their wheels you will find students there from the lower towns now and then an artist or a geologist absorbed in construing the ancient strata of the hills a few quiet families spend the summers there and often one or two tired members of that patient sisterhood known to lakelands as schoolmarms a quarter of a mile from the eagle house was what would have been described to its guests as an object of interest in the catalogue had the eagle house issued a catalogue this was an old old mill that was no longer a mill in the words of josiah rankin it was the only church in the united states sah with an overshot wheel and the only mill in the world sah with pews and a pipe organ the guests of the eagle house attended the old mill church each sabbath and heard the preacher liken the purified christian to bolted flour ground to usefulness between the millstones of experience and suffering every year about the beginning of autumn there came to the eagle house one abram strong who remained for a time an honoured and beloved guest in lakelands he was called father abram because his hair was so white his face so strong and kind and florid his laugh so merry and his black clothes and broad hat so priestly in appearance even new guests after three or four days acquaintance gave him this familiar title father abram came a long way to lakelands he lived in a big roaring town in the northwest where he owned mills not little mills with pews and an organ in them but great ugly mountain like mills that the freight trains crawled around all day like ants around an ant heap and now you must be told about father abram and the mill that was a church for their stories run together in the days when the church was a mill mr strong was the miller there was no jollier dustier busier happier miller in all the land than he he lived in a little cottage across the road from the mill his hand was heavy but his toll was light and the mountaineers brought their grain to him across many weary miles of rocky roads the delight of the miller s life was his little daughter aglaia that was a brave name truly for a flaxen haired toddler but the mountaineers love sonorous and stately names the mother had encountered it somewhere in a book and the deed was done in her babyhood aglaia herself repudiated the name as far as common use went and persisted in calling herself dums the miller and his wife often tried to coax from aglaia the source of this mysterious name but without results at last they arrived at a theory in the little garden behind the cottage was a bed of rhododendrons in which the child took a peculiar delight and interest it may have been that she perceived in dums a kinship to the formidable name of her favourite flowers when aglaia was four years old she and her father used to go through a little performance in the mill every afternoon that never failed to come off the weather permitting when supper was ready her mother would brush her hair and put on a clean apron and send her across to the mill to bring her father home when the miller saw her coming in the mill door he would come forward all white with the flour dust and wave his hand and sing an old miller s song that was familiar in those parts and ran something like this the wheel goes round the grist is ground the dusty miller s merry he sings all day his work is play while thinking of his dearie then aglaia would run to him laughing and call da da come take dums home and the miller would swing her to his shoulder and march over to supper singing the miller s song every evening this would take place one day only a week after her fourth birthday aglaia disappeared when last seen she was plucking wild flowers by the side of the road in front of the cottage a little while later her mother went out to see that she did not stray too faraway and she was already gone of course every effort was made to find her the neighbours gathered and searched the woods and the mountains for miles around they dragged every foot of the mill race and the creek for a long distance below the dam never a trace of her did they find a night or two before there had been a family of wanderers camped in a grove near by it was conjectured that they might have stolen the child but when their wagon was overtaken and searched she could not be found the miller remained at the mill for nearly two years and then his hope of finding her died out he and his wife moved to the northwest in a few years he was the owner of a modern mill in one of the important milling cities in that region mrs strong never recovered from the shock caused by the loss of aglaia and two years after they moved away the miller was left to bear his sorrow alone when abram strong became prosperous he paid a visit to lakelands and the old mill the scene was a sad one for him but he was a strong man and always appeared cheery and kindly it was then that he was inspired to convert the old mill into a church lakelands was too poor to build one and the still poorer mountaineers could not assist there was no place of worship nearer than twenty miles the miller altered the appearance of the mill as little as possible the big overshot wheel was left in its place the young people who came to the church used to cut their initials in its soft and slowly decaying wood the dam was partly destroyed and the clear mountain stream rippled unchecked down its rocky bed inside the mill the changes were greater the shafts and millstones and belts and pulleys were of course all removed there were two rows of benches with aisles between and a little raised platform and pulpit at one end on three sides overhead was a gallery containing seats and reached by a stairway inside there was also an organ a real pipe organ in the gallery that was the pride of the congregation of the old mill church miss phoebe summers was the organist the lakelands boys proudly took turns at pumping it for her at each sunday s service the rev mr banbridge was the preacher and rode down from squirrel gap on his old white horse without ever missing a service and abram strong paid for everything he paid the preacher five hundred dollars a year and miss phoebe two hundred dollars thus in memory of aglaia the old mill was converted into a blessing for the community in which she had once lived it seemed that the brief life of the child had brought about more good than the three score years and ten of many but abram strong set up yet another monument to her memory out from his mills in the northwest came the aglaia flour made from the hardest and finest wheat that could be raised the country soon found out that the aglaia flour had two prices one was the highest market price and the other was nothing wherever there happened a calamity that left people destitute a fire a flood a tornado a strike or a famine there would go hurrying a generous consignment of the aglaia at its nothing price it was given away cautiously and judiciously but it was freely given and not a penny could the hungry ones pay for it there got to be a saying that whenever there was a disastrous fire in the poor districts of a city the fire chief s buggy reached the scene first next the aglaia flour wagon and then the fire engines so this was abram strong s other monument to aglaia perhaps to a poet the theme may seem too utilitarian for beauty but to some the fancy will seem sweet and fine that the pure white virgin flour flying on its mission of love and charity might be likened to the spirit of the lost child whose memory it signalized there came a year that brought hard times to the cumberlands grain crops everywhere were light and there were no local crops at all mountain floods had done much damage to property even game in the woods was so scarce that the hunters brought hardly enough home to keep their folk alive especially about lakelands was the rigour felt as soon as abram strong heard of this his messages flew and the little narrow gauge cars began to unload aglaia flour there the miller s orders were to store the flour in the gallery of the old mill church and that every one who attended the church was to carry home a sack of it two weeks after that abram strong came for his yearly visit to the eagle house and became father abram again that season the eagle house had fewer guests than usual among them was rose chester miss chester came to lakelands from atlanta where she worked in a department store this was the first vacation outing of her life the wife of the store manager had once spent a summer at the eagle house she had taken a fancy to rose and had persuaded her to go there for her three weeks holiday the manager s wife gave her a letter to mrs rankin who gladly received her in her own charge and care miss chester was not very strong she was about twenty and pale and delicate from an indoor life but one week of lakelands gave her a brightness and spirit that changed her wonderfully the time was early september when the cumberlands are at their greatest beauty the mountain foliage was growing brilliant with autumnal colours one breathed aerial champagne the nights were deliciously cool causing one to snuggle cosily under the warm blankets of the eagle house father abram and miss chester became great friends the old miller learned her story from mrs rankin and his interest went out quickly to the slender lonely girl who was making her own way in the world the mountain country was new to miss chester she had lived many years in the warm flat town of atlanta and the grandeur and variety of the cumberlands delighted her she was determined to enjoy every moment of her stay her little hoard of savings had been estimated so carefully in connection with her expenses that she knew almost to a penny what her very small surplus would be when she returned to work miss chester was fortunate in gaining father abram for a friend and companion he knew every road and peak and slope of the mountains near lakelands through him she became acquainted with the solemn delight of the shadowy tilted aisles of the pine forests the dignity of the bare crags the crystal tonic mornings the dreamy golden afternoons full of mysterious sadness so her health improved and her spirits grew light she had a laugh as genial and hearty in its feminine way as the famous laugh of father abram both of them were natural optimists and both knew how to present a serene and cheerful face to the world one day miss chester learned from one of the guests the history of father abram s lost child quickly she hurried away and found the miller seated on his favourite rustic bench near the chalybeate spring he was surprised when his little friend slipped her hand into his and looked at him with tears in her eyes oh father abram she said i m so sorry i didn t know until to day about your little daughter you will find her yet some day oh i hope you will the miller looked down at her with his strong ready smile thank you miss rose he said in his usual cheery tones but i do not expect to find aglaia for a few years i hoped that she had been stolen by vagrants and that she still lived but i have lost that hope i believe that she was drowned i can understand said miss chester how the doubt must have made it so hard to bear and yet you are so cheerful and so ready to make other people s burdens light good father abram good miss rose mimicked the miller smiling who thinks of others more than you do a whimsical mood seemed to strike miss chester oh father abram she cried wouldn t it be grand if i should prove to be your daughter wouldn t it be romantic and wouldn t you like to have me for a daughter indeed i would said the miller heartily if aglaia had lived i could wish for nothing better than for her to have grown up to be just such a little woman as you are maybe you are aglaia he continued falling in with her playful mood can t you remember when we lived at the mill miss chester fell swiftly into serious meditation her large eyes were fixed vaguely upon something in the distance father abram was amused at her quick return to seriousness she sat thus for a long time before she spoke no she said at length with a long sigh i can t remember anything at all about a mill i don t think that i ever saw a flour mill in my life until i saw your funny little church and if i were your little girl i would remember it wouldn t i i m so sorry father abram so am i said father abram humouring her but if you cannot remember that you are my little girl miss rose surely you can recollect being some one else s you remember your own parents of course oh yes i remember them very well especially my father he wasn t a bit like you father abram oh i was only making believe come now you ve rested long enough you promised to show me the pool where you can see the trout playing this afternoon i never saw a trout late one afternoon father abram set out for the old mill alone he often went to sit and think of the old days when he lived in the cottage across the road time had smoothed away the sharpness of his grief until he no longer found the memory of those times painful but whenever abram strong sat in the melancholy september afternoons on the spot where dums used to run in every day with her yellow curls flying the smile that lakelands always saw upon his face was not there the miller made his way slowly up the winding steep road the trees crowded so close to the edge of it that he walked in their shade with his hat in his hand squirrels ran playfully upon the old rail fence at his right quails were calling to their young broods in the wheat stubble the low sun sent a torrent of pale gold up the ravine that opened to the west early september it was within a few days only of the anniversary of aglaia s disappearance the old overshot wheel half covered with mountain ivy caught patches of the warm sunlight filtering through the trees the cottage across the road was still standing but it would doubtless go down before the next winter s mountain blasts it was overrun with morning glory and wild gourd vines and the door hung by one hinge father abram pushed open the mill door and entered softly and then he stood still wondering he heard the sound of some one within weeping inconsolably he looked and saw miss chester sitting in a dim pew with her head bowed upon an open letter that her hands held father abram went to her and laid one of his strong hands firmly upon hers she looked up breathed his name and tried to speak further not yet miss rose said the miller kindly don t try to talk yet there s nothing as good for you as a nice quiet little cry when you are feeling blue it seemed that the old miller who had known so much sorrow himself was a magician in driving it away from others miss chester s sobs grew easier presently she took her little plain bordered handkerchief and wiped away a drop or two that had fallen from her eyes upon father abram s big hand then she looked up and smiled through her tears miss chester could always smile before her tears had dried just as father abram could smile through his own grief in that way the two were very much alike the miller asked her no questions but by and by miss chester began to tell him it was the old story that always seems so big and important to the young and that brings reminiscent smiles to their elders love was the theme as may be supposed there was a young man in atlanta full of all goodness and the graces who had discovered that miss chester also possessed these qualities above all other people in atlanta or anywhere else from greenland to patagonia she showed father abram the letter over which she had been weeping it was a manly tender letter a little superlative and urgent after the style of love letters written by young men full of goodness and the graces he proposed for miss chester s hand in marriage at once life he said since her departure for a three weeks visit was not to be endured he begged for an immediate answer and if it were favourable he promised to fly ignoring the narrow gauge railroad at once to lakelands and now where does the trouble come in asked the miller when he had read the letter i cannot marry him said miss chester do you want to marry him asked father abram oh i love him she answered but down went her head and she sobbed again come miss rose said the miller you can give me your confidence i do not question you but i think you can trust me i do trust you said the girl i will tell you why i must refuse ralph i am nobody i haven t even a name the name i call myself is a lie ralph is a noble man i love him with all my heart but i can never be his what talk is this said father abram you said that you remember your parents why do you say you have no name i do not understand i do remember them said miss chester i remember them too well my first recollections are of our life somewhere in the far south we moved many times to different towns and states i have picked cotton and worked in factories and have often gone without enough food and clothes my mother was sometimes good to me my father was always cruel and beat me i think they were both idle and unsettled one night when we were living in a little town on a river near atlanta they had a great quarrel it was while they were abusing and taunting each other that i learned oh father abram i learned that i didn t even have the right to be don t you understand i had no right even to a name i was nobody i ran away that night i walked to atlanta and found work i gave myself the name of rose chester and have earned my own living ever since now you know why i cannot marry ralph and oh i can never tell him why better than any sympathy more helpful than pity was father abram s depreciation of her woes why dear dear is that all he said fie fie i thought something was in the way if this perfect young man is a man at all he will not care a pinch of bran for your family tree dear miss rose take my word for it it is yourself he cares for tell him frankly just as you have told me and i ll warrant that he will laugh at your story and think all the more of you for it i shall never tell him said miss chester sadly and i shall never marry him nor any one else i have not the right but they saw a long shadow come bobbing up the sunlit road and then came a shorter one bobbing by its side and presently two strange figures approached the church the long shadow was made by miss phoebe summers the organist come to practise tommy teague aged twelve was responsible for the shorter shadow it was tommy s day to pump the organ for miss phoebe and his bare toes proudly spurned the dust of the road miss phoebe in her lilac spray chintz dress with her accurate little curls hanging over each ear courtesied low to father abram and shook her curls ceremoniously at miss chester then she and her assistant climbed the steep stairway to the organ loft in the gathering shadows below father abram and miss chester lingered they were silent and it is likely that they were busy with their memories miss chester sat leaning her head on her hand with her eyes fixed far away father abram stood in the next pew looking thoughtfully out of the door at the road and the ruined cottage suddenly the scene was transformed for him back almost a score of years into the past for as tommy pumped away miss phoebe struck a low bass note on the organ and held it to test the volume of air that it contained the church ceased to exist so far as father abram was concerned the deep booming vibration that shook the little frame building was no note from an organ but the humming of the mill machinery he felt sure that the old overshot wheel was turning that he was back again a dusty merry miller in the old mountain mill and now evening was come and soon would come aglaia with flying colours toddling across the road to take him home to supper father abram s eyes were fixed upon the broken door of the cottage and then came another wonder in the gallery overhead the sacks of flour were stacked in long rows perhaps a mouse had been at one of them anyway the jar of the deep organ note shook down between the cracks of the gallery floor a stream of flour covering father abram from head to foot with the white dust and then the old miller stepped into the aisle and waved his arms and began to sing the miller s song the wheel goes round the grist is ground the dusty miller s merry and then the rest of the miracle happened miss chester was leaning forward from her pew as pale as the flour itself her wide open eyes staring at father abram like one in a waking dream when he began the song she stretched out her arms to him her lips moved she called to him in dreamy tones da da come take dums home miss phoebe released the low key of the organ but her work had been well done the note that she struck had beaten down the doors of a closed memory and father abram held his lost aglaia close in his arms when you visit lakelands they will tell you more of this story they will tell you how the lines of it were afterward traced and the history of the miller s daughter revealed after the gipsy wanderers had stolen her on that september day attracted by her childish beauty but you should wait until you sit comfortably on the shaded porch of the eagle house and then you can have the story at your ease it seems best that our part of it should close while miss phoebe s deep bass note was yet reverberating softly and yet to my mind the finest thing of it all happened while father abram and his daughter were walking back to the eagle house in the long twilight almost too glad to speak father she said somewhat timidly and doubtfully have you a great deal of money a great deal said the miller well that depends there is plenty unless you want to buy the moon or something equally expensive would it cost very very much asked aglaia who had always counted her dimes so carefully to send a telegram to atlanta ah said father abram with a little sigh i see you want to ask ralph to come aglaia looked up at him with a tender smile i want to ask him to wait she said i have just found my father and i want it to be just we two for a while i want to tell him he will have to wait new york by camp fire light away out in the creek nation we learned things about new york we were on a hunting trip and were camped one night on the bank of a little stream bud kingsbury was our skilled hunter and guide and it was from his lips that we had explanations of manhattan and the queer folks that inhabit it bud had once spent a month in the metropolis and a week or two at other times and he was pleased to discourse to us of what he had seen fifty yards away from our camp was pitched the teepee of a wandering family of indians that had come up and settled there for the night an old old indian woman was trying to build a fire under an iron pot hung upon three sticks bud went over to her assistance and soon had her fire going when he came back we complimented him playfully upon his gallantry oh said bud don t mention it it s a way i have whenever i see a lady trying to cook things in a pot and having trouble i always go to the rescue i done the same thing once in a high toned house in new york city heap big society teepee on fifth avenue that injun lady kind of recalled it to my mind yes i endeavours to be polite and help the ladies out the camp demanded the particulars i was manager of the triangle b ranch in the panhandle said bud it was owned at that time by old man sterling of new york he wanted to sell out and he wrote for me to come on to new york and explain the ranch to the syndicate that wanted to buy so i sends to fort worth and has a forty dollar suit of clothes made and hits the trail for the big village well when i got there old man sterling and his outfit certainly laid themselves out to be agreeable we had business and pleasure so mixed up that you couldn t tell whether it was a treat or a trade half the time we had trolley rides and cigars and theatre round ups and rubber parties rubber parties said a listener inquiringly sure said bud didn t you never attend em you walk around and try to look at the tops of the skyscrapers well we sold the ranch and old man sterling asks me round to his house to take grub on the night before i started back it wasn t any high collared affair just me and the old man and his wife and daughter but they was a fine haired outfit all right and the lilies of the field wasn t in it they made my fort worth clothes carpenter look like a dealer in horse blankets and gee strings and then the table was all pompous with flowers and there was a whole kit of tools laid out beside everybody s plate you d have thought you was fixed out to burglarize a restaurant before you could get your grub but i d been in new york over a week then and i was getting on to stylish ways i kind of trailed behind and watched the others use the hardware supplies and then i tackled the chuck with the same weapons it ain t much trouble to travel with the high flyers after you find out their gait i got along fine i was feeling cool and agreeable and pretty soon i was talking away fluent as you please all about the ranch and the west and telling em how the indians eat grasshopper stew and snakes and you never saw people so interested but the real joy of that feast was that miss sterling just a little trick she was not bigger than two bits worth of chewing plug but she had a way about her that seemed to say she was the people and you believed it and yet she never put on any airs and she smiled at me the same as if i was a millionaire while i was telling about a creek dog feast and listened like it was news from home by and by after we had eat oysters and some watery soup and truck that never was in my repertory a methodist preacher brings in a kind of camp stove arrangement all silver on long legs with a lamp under it miss sterling lights up and begins to do some cooking right on the supper table i wondered why old man sterling didn t hire a cook with all the money he had pretty soon she dished out some cheesy tasting truck that she said was rabbit but i swear there had never been a molly cotton tail in a mile of it the last thing on the programme was lemonade it was brought around in little flat glass bowls and set by your plate i was pretty thirsty and i picked up mine and took a big swig of it right there was where the little lady had made a mistake she had put in the lemon all right but she d forgot the sugar the best housekeepers slip up sometimes i thought maybe miss sterling was just learning to keep house and cook that rabbit would surely make you think so and i says to myself little lady sugar or no sugar i ll stand by you and i raises up my bowl again and drinks the last drop of the lemonade and then all the balance of em picks up their bowls and does the same and then i gives miss sterling the laugh proper just to carry it off like a joke so she wouldn t feel bad about the mistake after we all went into the sitting room she sat down and talked to me quite awhile it was so kind of you mr kingsbury says she to bring my blunder off so nicely it was so stupid of me to forget the sugar never you mind says i some lucky man will throw his rope over a mighty elegant little housekeeper some day not far from here if you mean me mr kingsbury says she laughing out loud i hope he will be as lenient with my poor housekeeping as you have been don t mention it says i anything to oblige the ladies bud ceased his reminiscences and then some one asked him what he considered the most striking and prominent trait of new yorkers the most visible and peculiar trait of new york folks answered bud is new york most of em has new york on the brain they have heard of other places such as waco and paris and hot springs and london but they don t believe in em they think that town is all merino now to show you how much they care for their village i ll tell you about one of em that strayed out as far as the triangle b while i was working there this new yorker come out there looking for a job on the ranch he said he was a good horseback rider and there was pieces of tanbark hanging on his clothes yet from his riding school well for a while they put him to keeping books in the ranch store for he was a devil at figures but he got tired of that and asked for something more in the line of activity the boys on the ranch liked him all right but he made us tired shouting new york all the time every night he d tell us about east river and j p morgan and the eden musee and hetty green and central park till we used to throw tin plates and branding irons at him one day this chap gets on a pitching pony and the pony kind of sidled up his back and went to eating grass while the new yorker was coming down he come down on his head on a chunk of mesquit wood and he didn t show any designs toward getting up again we laid him out in a tent and he begun to look pretty dead so gideon pease saddles up and burns the wind for old doc sleeper s residence in dogtown thirty miles away the doctor comes over and he investigates the patient boys says he you might as well go to playing seven up for his saddle and clothes for his head s fractured and if he lives ten minutes it will be a remarkable case of longevity of course we didn t gamble for the poor rooster s saddle that was one of doc s jokes but we stood around feeling solemn and all of us forgive him for having talked us to death about new york i never saw anybody about to hand in his checks act more peaceful than this fellow his eyes were fixed way up in the air and he was using rambling words to himself all about sweet music and beautiful streets and white robed forms and he was smiling like dying was a pleasure he s about gone now said doc whenever they begin to think they see heaven it s all off blamed if that new york man didn t sit right up when he heard the doc say that say says he kind of disappointed was that heaven confound it all i thought it was broadway some of you fellows get my clothes i m going to get up and i ll be blamed concluded bud if he wasn t on the train with a ticket for new york in his pocket four days afterward the adventures of shamrock jolnes i am so fortunate as to count shamrock jolnes the great new york detective among my muster of friends jolnes is what is called the inside man of the city detective force he is an expert in the use of the typewriter and it is his duty whenever there is a murder mystery to be solved to sit at a desk telephone at headquarters and take down the messages of cranks who phone in their confessions to having committed the crime but on certain off days when confessions are coming in slowly and three or four newspapers have run to earth as many different guilty persons jolnes will knock about the town with me exhibiting to my great delight and instruction his marvellous powers of observation and deduction the other day i dropped in at headquarters and found the great detective gazing thoughtfully at a string that was tied tightly around his little finger good morning whatsup he said without turning his head i m glad to notice that you ve had your house fitted up with electric lights at last will you please tell me i said in surprise how you knew that i am sure that i never mentioned the fact to any one and the wiring was a rush order not completed until this morning nothing easier said jolnes genially as you came in i caught the odour of the cigar you are smoking i know an expensive cigar and i know that not more than three men in new york can afford to smoke cigars and pay gas bills too at the present time that was an easy one but i am working just now on a little problem of my own why have you that string on your finger i asked that s the problem said jolnes my wife tied that on this morning to remind me of something i was to send up to the house sit down whatsup and excuse me for a few moments the distinguished detective went to a wall telephone and stood with the receiver to his ear for probably ten minutes were you listening to a confession i asked when he had returned to his chair perhaps said jolnes with a smile it might be called something of the sort to be frank with you whatsup i ve cut out the dope i ve been increasing the quantity for so long that morphine doesn t have much effect on me any more i ve got to have something more powerful that telephone i just went to is connected with a room in the waldorf where there s an author s reading in progress now to get at the solution of this string after five minutes of silent pondering jolnes looked at me with a smile and nodded his head wonderful man i exclaimed already it is quite simple he said holding up his finger you see that knot that is to prevent my forgetting it is therefore a forget me knot a forget me not is a flower it was a sack of flour that i was to send home beautiful i could not help crying out in admiration suppose we go out for a ramble suggested jolnes there is only one case of importance on hand just now old man mccarty one hundred and four years old died from eating too many bananas the evidence points so strongly to the mafia that the police have surrounded the second avenue katzenjammer gambrinus club no and the capture of the assassin is only the matter of a few hours the detective force has not yet been called on for assistance jolnes and i went out and up the street toward the corner where we were to catch a surface car half way up the block we met rheingelder an acquaintance of ours who held a city hall position good morning rheingelder said jolnes halting nice breakfast that was you had this morning always on the lookout for the detective s remarkable feats of deduction i saw jolnes s eye flash for an instant upon a long yellow splash on the shirt bosom and a smaller one upon the chin of rheingelder both undoubtedly made by the yolk of an egg oh dot is some of your detectiveness said rheingelder shaking all over with a smile vell i pet you trinks und cigars all round dot you cannot tell vot i haf eaten for breakfast done said jolnes sausage pumpernickel and coffee rheingelder admitted the correctness of the surmise and paid the bet when we had proceeded on our way i said to jolnes i thought you looked at the egg spilled on his chin and shirt front i did said jolnes that is where i began my deduction rheingelder is a very economical saving man yesterday eggs dropped in the market to twenty eight cents per dozen to day they are quoted at forty two rheingelder ate eggs yesterday and to day he went back to his usual fare a little thing like this isn t anything whatsup it belongs to the primary arithmetic class when we boarded the street car we found the seats all occupied principally by ladies jolnes and i stood on the rear platform about the middle of the car there sat an elderly man with a short gray beard who looked to be the typical well dressed new yorker at successive corners other ladies climbed aboard and soon three or four of them were standing over the man clinging to straps and glaring meaningly at the man who occupied the coveted seat but he resolutely retained his place we new yorkers i remarked to jolnes have about lost our manners as far as the exercise of them in public goes perhaps so said jolnes lightly but the man you evidently refer to happens to be a very chivalrous and courteous gentleman from old virginia he is spending a few days in new york with his wife and two daughters and he leaves for the south to night you know him then i said in amazement i never saw him before we stepped on the car declared the detective smilingly by the gold tooth of the witch of endor i cried if you can construe all that from his appearance you are dealing in nothing else than black art the habit of observation nothing more said jolnes if the old gentleman gets off the car before we do i think i can demonstrate to you the accuracy of my deduction three blocks farther along the gentleman rose to leave the car jolnes addressed him at the door pardon me sir but are you not colonel hunter of norfolk virginia no suh was the extremely courteous answer my name suh is ellison major winfield r ellison from fairfax county in the same state i know a good many people suh in norfolk the goodriches the tollivers and the crabtrees suh but i never had the pleasure of meeting yo friend colonel hunter i am happy to say suh that i am going back to virginia to night after having spent a week in yo city with my wife and three daughters i shall be in norfolk in about ten days and if you will give me yo name suh i will take pleasure in looking up colonel hunter and telling him that you inquired after him suh thank you said jolnes tell him that reynolds sent his regards if you will be so kind i glanced at the great new york detective and saw that a look of intense chagrin had come upon his clear cut features failure in the slightest point always galled shamrock jolnes did you say your three daughters he asked of the virginia gentleman yes suh my three daughters all as fine girls as there are in fairfax county was the answer with that major ellison stopped the car and began to descend the step shamrock jolnes clutched his arm one moment sir he begged in an urbane voice in which i alone detected the anxiety am i not right in believing that one of the young ladies is an adopted daughter you are suh admitted the major from the ground but how the devil you knew it suh is mo than i can tell and mo than i can tell too i said as the car went on jolnes was restored to his calm observant serenity by having wrested victory from his apparent failure so after we got off the car he invited me into a cafe promising to reveal the process of his latest wonderful feat in the first place he began after we were comfortably seated i knew the gentleman was no new yorker because he was flushed and uneasy and restless on account of the ladies that were standing although he did not rise and give them his seat i decided from his appearance that he was a southerner rather than a westerner next i began to figure out his reason for not relinquishing his seat to a lady when he evidently felt strongly but not overpoweringly impelled to do so i very quickly decided upon that i noticed that one of his eyes had received a severe jab in one corner which was red and inflamed and that all over his face were tiny round marks about the size of the end of an uncut lead pencil also upon both of his patent leather shoes were a number of deep imprints shaped like ovals cut off square at one end now there is only one district in new york city where a man is bound to receive scars and wounds and indentations of that sort and that is along the sidewalks of twenty third street and a portion of sixth avenue south of there i knew from the imprints of trampling french heels on his feet and the marks of countless jabs in the face from umbrellas and parasols carried by women in the shopping district that he had been in conflict with the amazonian troops and as he was a man of intelligent appearance i knew he would not have braved such dangers unless he had been dragged thither by his own women folk therefore when he got on the car his anger at the treatment he had received was sufficient to make him keep his seat in spite of his traditions of southern chivalry that is all very well i said but why did you insist upon daughters and especially two daughters why couldn t a wife alone have taken him shopping there had to be daughters said jolnes calmly if he had only a wife and she near his own age he could have bluffed her into going alone if he had a young wife she would prefer to go alone so there you are i ll admit that i said but now why two daughters and how in the name of all the prophets did you guess that one was adopted when he told you he had three don t say guess said jolnes with a touch of pride in his air there is no such word in the lexicon of ratiocination in major ellison s buttonhole there was a carnation and a rosebud backed by a geranium leaf no woman ever combined a carnation and a rosebud into a boutonniere close your eyes whatsup and give the logic of your imagination a chance cannot you see the lovely adele fastening the carnation to the lapel so that papa may be gay upon the street and then the romping edith may dancing up with sisterly jealousy to add her rosebud to the adornment and then i cried beginning to feel enthusiasm when he declared that he had three daughters i could see said jolnes one in the background who added no flower and i knew that she must be adopted i broke in i give you every credit but how did you know he was leaving for the south to night in his breast pocket said the great detective something large and oval made a protuberance good liquor is scarce on trains and it is a long journey from new york to fairfax county again i must bow to you i said and tell me this so that my last shred of doubt will be cleared away why did you decide that he was from virginia it was very faint i admit answered shamrock jolnes but no trained observer could have failed to detect the odour of mint in the car the lady higher up new york city they said was deserted and that accounted doubtless for the sounds carrying so far in the tranquil summer air the breeze was south by southwest the hour was midnight the theme was a bit of feminine gossip by wireless mythology three hundred and sixty five feet above the heated asphalt the tiptoeing symbolic deity on manhattan pointed her vacillating arrow straight for the time in the direction of her exalted sister on liberty island the lights of the great garden were out the b enches in the square were filled with sleepers in postures so strange that beside them the writhing figures in dore s illustrations of the inferno would have straightened into tailor s dummies the statue of diana on the tower of the garden its constancy shown by its weathercock ways its innocence by the coating of gold that it has acquired its devotion to style by its single graceful flying scarf its candour and artlessness by its habit of ever drawing the long bow its metropolitanism by its posture of swift flight to catch a harlem train remained poised with its arrow pointed across the upper bay had that arrow sped truly and horizontally it would have passed fifty feet above the head of the heroic matron whose duty it is to offer a cast ironical welcome to the oppressed of other lands seaward this lady gazed and the furrows between steamship lines began to cut steerage rates the translators too have put an extra burden upon her liberty lighting the world as her creator christened her would have had a no more responsible duty except for the size of it than that of an electrician or a standard oil magnate but to enlighten the world as our learned civic guardians englished it requires abler qualities and so poor liberty instead of having a sinecure as a mere illuminator must be converted into a chautauqua schoolma am with the oceans for her field instead of the placid classic lake with a fireless torch and an empty head must she dispel the shadows of the world and teach it its a b c s ah there mrs liberty called a clear rollicking soprano

ve kept a pretty good watch on the island of manhattan since i ve been up here that s a pretty sick looking bunch of liberty chasers they dump down at your end of it but they don t all stay that way every little while up here i see guys signing checks and voting the right ticket and encouraging the arts and t aking a bath every morning that was shoved ashore by a dock labourer born in the united states who never earned over forty dollars a month don t run down your job aunt liberty you re all right all right the greater coney next sunday said dennis carnahan i ll be after going down to see the new coney island that s risen like a phoenix bird from the ashes of the old resort i m going with norah flynn and we ll fall victims to all the dry goods deceptions from the red flannel eruption of mount vesuvius to the pink silk ribbons on the race suicide problems in the incubator kiosk was i there before i was i was there last tuesday did i see the sights i did not last monday i amalgamated myself with the bricklayers union and in accordance with the rules i was ordered to quit work the same day on account of a sympathy strike with the lady salmon canners lodge no of tacoma washington twas disturbed i was in mind and proclivities by losing me job bein already harassed in me soul on account of havin quarrelled with norah flynn a week before by reason of hard words spoken at the dairymen and street sprinkler drivers semi annual ball caused by jealousy and prickly heat and that divil andy coghlin so i says it will be coney for tuesday and if the chutes and the short change and the green corn silk between the teeth don t create diversions and get me feeling better then i don t know at all ye will have heard that coney has received moral reconstruction the old bowery where they used to take your tintype by force and give ye knockout drops before having your palm read is now called the wall street of the island the wienerwurst stands are required by law to keep a news ticker in em and the doughnuts are examined every four years by a retired steamboat inspector the nigger man s head that was used by the old patrons to throw baseballs at is now illegal and by order of the police commissioner the image of a man drivin an automobile has been substituted i hear that the old immoral amusements have been suppressed people who used to go down from new york to sit in the sand and dabble in the surf now give up their quarters to squeeze through turnstiles and see imitations of city fires and floods painted on canvas the reprehensible and degradin resorts that disgraced old coney are said to be wiped out the wipin out process consists of raisin the price from cents to cents and hirin a blonde named maudie to sell tickets instead of micky the bowery bite that s what they say i don t know but to coney i goes a tuesday i gets off the l and starts for the glitterin show twas a fine sight the babylonian towers and the hindoo roof gardens was blazin with thousands of electric lights and the streets was thick with people tis a true thing they say that coney levels all rank i see millionaires eatin popcorn and trampin along with the crowd and i see eight dollar a week clothin store clerks in red automobiles fightin one another for who d squeeze the horn when they come to a corner i made a mistake i says to myself twas not coney i needed when a man s sad tis not scenes of hilarity he wants twould be far better for him to meditate in a graveyard or to attend services at the paradise roof gardens tis no consolation when a man s lost his sweetheart to order hot corn and have the waiter bring him the powdered sugar cruet instead of salt and then conceal himself or to have zozookum the gipsy palmist tell him that he has three children and to look out for another serious calamity price twenty five cents i walked far away down on the beach to the ruins of an old pavilion near one corner of this new private park dreamland a year ago that old pavilion was standin up straight and the old style waiters was slammin a week s supply of clam chowder down in front of you for a nickel and callin you cully friendly and vice was rampant and you got back to new york with enough change to take a car at the bridge now they tell me that they serve welsh rabbits on surf avenue and you get the right change back in the movin picture joints i sat down at one side of the old pavilion and looked at the surf spreadin itself on the beach and thought about the time me and norah flynn sat on that spot last summer twas before reform struck the island and we was happy we had tintypes and chowder in the ribald dives and the egyptian sorceress of the nile told norah out of her hand while i was waitin in the door that twould be the luck of her to marry a red headed gossoon with two crooked legs and i was overrunnin with joy on account of the allusion and twas there that norah flynn put her two hands in mine a year before and we talked of flats and the things she could cook and the love business that goes with such episodes and that was coney as we loved it and as the hand of satan was upon it friendly and noisy and your money s worth with no fence around the ocean and not too many electric lights to show the sleeve of a black serge coat against a white shirtwaist i sat with my back to the parks where they had the moon and the dreams and the steeples corralled and longed for the old coney there wasn t many people on the beach lots of them was feedin pennies into the slot machines to see the interrupted courtship in the movin pictures and a good many was takin the sea air in the canals of venice and some was breathin the smoke of the sea battle by actual warships in a tank filled with real water a few was down on the sands enjoyin the moonlight and the water and the heart of me was heavy for the new morals of the old island while the bands behind me played and the sea pounded on the bass drum in front and directly i got up and walked along the old pavilion and there on the other side of half in the dark was a slip of a girl sittin on the tumble down timbers and unless i m a liar she was cryin by herself there all alone is it trouble you are in now miss says i and what s to be done about it tis none of your business at all denny carnahan says she sittin up straight and it was the voice of no other than norah flynn then it s not says i and we re after having a pleasant evening miss flynn have ye seen the sights of this new coney island then i presume ye have come here for that purpose says i i have says she me mother and uncle tim they are waiting beyond tis an elegant evening i ve had i ve seen all the attractions that be right ye are says i to norah and i don t know when i ve been that amused after disportin me self among the most laughable moral improvements of the revised shell games i took meself to the shore for the benefit of the cool air and did ye observe the durbar miss flynn i did says she reflectin but tis not safe i m thinkin to ride down them slantin things into the water how did ye fancy the shoot the chutes i asks true then i m afraid of guns says norah they make such noise in my ears but uncle tim he shot them he did and won cigars tis a fine time we had this day mr carnahan i m glad you ve enjoyed yerself i says i suppose you ve had a roarin fine time seein the sights and how did the incubators and the helter skelter and the midgets suit the taste of ye i i wasn t hungry says norah faint but mother ate a quantity of all of em i m that pleased with the fine things in the new coney island says she that it s the happiest day i ve seen in a long time at all did you see venice says i we did says she she was a beauty she was all dressed in red she was with i listened no more to norah flynn i stepped up and i gathered her in my arms tis a story teller ye are norah flynn says i ye ve seen no more of the greater coney island than i have meself come now tell the truth ye came to sit by the old pavilion by the waves where you sat last summer and made dennis carnahan a happy man speak up and tell the truth norah stuck her nose against me vest i despise it denny she says half cryin mother and uncle tim went to see the shows but i came down here to think of you i couldn t bear the lights and the crowd are you forgivin me denny for the words we had twas me fault says i i came here for the same reason meself look at the lights norah i says turning my back to the sea ain t they pretty they are says norah with her eyes shinin and do ye hear the bands playin oh denny i think i d like to see it all the old coney is gone darlin i says to her everything moves when a man s glad it s not scenes of sadness he wants tis a greater coney we have here but we couldn t see it till we got in the humour for it next sunday norah darlin we ll see the new place from end to end law and order i found myself in texas recently revisiting old places and vistas at a sheep ranch where i had sojourned many years ago i stopped for a week and as all visitors do i heartily plunged into the business at hand which happened to be that of dipping the sheep now this process is so different from ordinary human baptism that it deserves a word of itself a vast iron cauldron with half the fires of avernus beneath it is partly filled with water that soon boils furiously into that is cast concentrated lye lime and sulphur which is allowed to stew and fume until the witches broth is strong enough to scorch the third arm of palladino herself then this concentrated brew is mixed in a long deep vat with cubic gallons of hot water and the sheep are caught by their hind legs and flung into the compound after being thoroughly ducked by means of a forked pole in the hands of a gentleman detailed for that purpose they are allowed to clamber up an incline into a corral and dry or die as the state of their constitutions may decree if you ever caught an able bodied two year old mutton by the hind legs and felt the volts of kicking that he can send though your arm seventeen times before you can hurl him into the vat you will of course hope that he may die instead of dry but this is merely to explain why bud oakley and i gladly stretched ourselves on the bank of the nearby charco after the dipping glad for the welcome inanition and pure contact with the earth after our muscle racking labours the flock was a small one and we finished at three in the afternoon so bud brought from the morral on his saddle horn coffee and a coffeepot and a big hunk of bread and some side bacon mr mills the ranch owner and my old friend rode away to the ranch with his force of mexican trabajadores while the bacon was frizzling nicely there was the sound of horses hoofs behind us bud s six shooter lay in its scabbard ten feet away from his hand he paid not the slightest heed to the approaching horseman this attitude of a texas ranchman was so different from the old time custom that i marvelled instinctively i turned to inspect the possible foe that menaced us in the rear i saw a horseman dressed in black who might have been a lawyer or a parson or an undertaker trotting peaceably along the road by the arroyo bud noticed my precautionary movement and smiled sarcastically and sorrowfully you ve been away too long said he you don t need to look around any more when anybody gallops up behind you in this state unless something hits you in the back and even then it s liable to be only a bunch of tracts or a petition to sign against the trusts i never looked at that hombre that rode by but i ll bet a quart of sheep dip that he s some double dyed son of a popgun out rounding up prohibition votes times have changed bud said i oracularly law and order is the rule now in the south and the southwest i caught a cold gleam from bud s pale blue eyes not that i i began hastily of course you don t said bud warmly you know better you ve lived here before law and order you say twenty years ago we had em here we only had two or three laws such as against murder before witnesses and being caught stealing horses and voting the republican ticket but how is it now all we get is orders and the laws go out of the state them legislators set up there at austin and don t do nothing but make laws against kerosene oil and schoolbooks being brought into the state i re ckon they was afraid some man would go home some evening after work and light up and get an education and go to work and make laws to repeal aforesaid laws me i m for the old days when law and order meant what they said a law was a law and a order was a order but i began i was going on continued bud while this coffee is boiling to describe to you a case of genuine law and order that i knew of once in the times when cases was decided in the chambers of a six shooter instead of a supreme court you ve heard of old ben kirkman the cattle king his ranch run from the nueces to the rio grande in them days as you know there was cattle barons and cattle kings the difference was this when a cattleman went to san antone and bought beer for the newspaper reporters and only give them the number of cattle he actually owned they wrote him up for a baron when he bought em champagne wine and added in the amount of cattle he had stole they called him a king luke summers was one of his range bosses and down to the king s ranch comes one day a bunch of these oriental people from new york or kansas city or thereabouts luke was detailed with a squad to ride about with em and see that the rattlesnakes got fair warning when they was coming and drive the deer out of their way among the bunch was a black eyed girl that wore a number two shoe that s all i noticed about her but luke must have seen more for he married her one day before the caballard started back and went over on canada verde and set up a ranch of his own i m skipping over the sentimental stuff on purpose because i never saw or wanted to see any of it and luke takes me along with him because we was old friends and i handled cattle to suit him i m skipping over much what followed because i never saw or wanted to see any of it but three years afterward there was a boy kid stumbling and blubbering around the galleries and floors of luke s ranch i never had no use for kids but it seems they did and i m skipping over much what followed until one day out to the ranch drives in hacks and buckboards a lot of mrs summers s friends from the east a sister or so and two or three men one looked like an uncle to somebody and one looked like nothing and the other one had on corkscrew pants and spoke in a tone of voice i never liked a man who spoke in a tone of voice i m skipping over much what followed but one afternoon when i rides up to the ranch house to get some orders about a drove of beeves that was to be shipped i hears something like a popgun go off i waits at the hitching rack not wishing to intrude on private affairs in a little while luke comes out and gives some orders to some of his mexican hands and they go and hitch up sundry and divers vehicles and mighty soon out comes one of the sisters or so and some of the two or three men but two of the two or thee men carries between em the corkscrew man who spoke in a tone of voice and lays him flat down in one of the wagons and they all might have been seen wending their way away bud says luke to me i want you to fix up a little and go up to san antone with me let me get on my mexican spurs says i and i m your company one of the sisters or so seems to have stayed at the ranch with mrs summers and the kid we rides to encinal and catches the international and hits san antone in the morning after breakfast luke steers me straight to the office of a lawyer they go in a room and talk and then come out oh there won t be any trouble mr summers says the lawyer i ll acquaint judge simmons with the facts to day and the matter will be put through as promptly as possible law and order reigns in this state as swift and sure as any in the country i ll wait for the decree if it won t take over half an hour says luke tut tut says the lawyer man law must take its course come back day after to morrow at half past nine at that time me and luke shows up and the lawyer hands him a folded document and luke writes him out a check on the sidewalk luke holds up the paper to me and puts a finger the size of a kitchen door latch on it and says decree of ab so lute divorce with cus to dy of the child skipping over much what has happened of which i know nothing says i it looks to me like a split couldn t the lawyer man have made it a strike for you bud says he in a pained style that child is the one thing i have to live for she may go but the boy is mine think of it i have cus to dy of the child all right says i if it s the law let s abide by it but i think says i that judge simmons might have used exemplary clemency or whatever is the legal term in our case you see i wasn t inveigled much into the desirableness of having infants around a ranch except the kind that feed themselves and sell for so much on the hoof when they grow up but luke was struck with that sort of parental foolishness that i never could understand all the way riding from the station back to the ranch he kept pulling that decree out of his pocket and laying his finger on the back of it and reading off to me the sum and substance of it cus to dy of the child bud says he don t forget it cus to dy of the child but when we hits the ranch we finds our decree of court obviated nolle prossed and remanded for trial mrs summers and the kid was gone they tell us that an hour after me and luke had started for san antone she had a team hitched and lit out for the nearest station with her trunks and the youngster luke takes out his decree once more and reads off its emoluments it ain t possible bud says he for this to be it s contrary to law and order it s wrote as plain as day here cus to dy of the child there is what you might call a human leaning says i toward smashing em both not to mention the child judge simmons goes on luke is a incorporated officer of the law she can t take the boy away he belongs to me by statutes passed and approved by the state of texas and he s removed from the jurisdiction of mundane mandamuses says i by the unearthly statutes of female partiality let us praise the lord and be thankful for whatever small mercies i begins but i see luke don t listen to me tired as he was he calls for a fresh horse and starts back again for the station he come back two weeks afterward not saying much we can t get the trail says he but we ve done all the telegraphing that the wires ll stand and we ve got these city rangers they call detectives on the lookout in the meantime bud says he we ll round up them cows on brush creek and wait for the law to take its course and after that we never alluded to allusions as you might say skipping over much what happened in the next twelve years luke was made sheriff of mojada county he made me his office deputy now don t get in your mind no wrong apparitions of a office deputy doing sums in a book or mashing letters in a cider press in them days his job was to watch the back windows so nobody didn t plug the sheriff in the rear while he was adding up mileage at his desk in front and in them days i had qualifications for the job and there was law and order in mojada county and schoolbooks and all the whiskey you wanted and the government built its own battleships instead of collecting nickels from the school children to do it with and as i say there was law and order instead of enactments and restrictions such as disfigure our umpire state to day we had our office at bildad the county seat from which we emerged forth on necessary occasions to soothe whatever fracases and unrest that might occur in our jurisdiction skipping over much what happened while me and luke was sheriff i want to give you an idea of how the law was respected in them days luke was what you would call one of the most conscious men in the world he never knew much book law but he had the inner emoluments of justice and mercy inculcated into his system if a respectable citizen shot a mexican or held up a train and cleaned out the safe in the express car and luke ever got hold of him he d give the guilty party such a reprimand and a cussin out that he d probable never do it again but once let somebody steal a horse unless it was a spanish pony or cut a wire fence or otherwise impair the peace and indignity of mojada county luke and me would be on em with habeas corpuses and smokeless powder and all the modern inventions of equity and etiquette we certainly had our county on a basis of lawfulness i ve known persons of eastern classification with little spotted caps and buttoned up shoes to get off the train at bildad and eat sandwiches at the railroad station without being shot at or even roped and drug about by the citizens of the town luke had his own ideas of legality and justice he was kind of training me to succeed him when he went out of office he was always looking ahead to the time when he d quit sheriffing what he wanted to do was to build a yellow house with lattice work under the porch and have hens scratching in the yard the one main thing in his mind seemed to be the yard bud he says to me by instinct and sentiment i m a contractor i want to be a contractor that s what i ll be when i get out of office what kind of a contractor says i it sounds like a kind of a business to me you ain t going to haul cement or establish branches or work on a railroad are you you don t understand says luke i m tired of space and horizons and territory and distances and things like that what i want is reasonable contraction i want a yard with a fence around it that you can go out and set on after supper and listen to whip poor wills says luke that s the kind of a man he was he was home like although he d had bad luck in such investments but he never talked about them times on the ranch it seemed like he d forgotten about it i wondered how with his ideas of yards and chickens and notions of lattice work he d seemed to have got out of his mind that kid of his that had been taken away from him unlawful in spite of his decree of court but he wasn t a man you could ask about such things as he didn t refer to in his own conversation i reckon he d put all his emotions and ideas into being sheriff i ve read in books about men that was disappointed in these poetic and fine haired and high collared affairs with ladies renouncing truck of that kind and wrapping themselves up into some occupation like painting pictures or herding sheep or science or teaching school something to make em forget well i guess that was the way with luke but as he couldn t paint pictures he took it out in rounding up horse thieves and in making mojada county a safe place to sleep in if you was well armed and not afraid of requisitions or tarantulas one day there passes through bildad a bunch of these money investors from the east and they stopped off there bildad being the dinner station on the i g n they was just coming back from mexico looking after mines and such there was five of em four solid parties with gold watch chains that would grade up over two hundred pounds on the hoof and one kid about seventeen or eighteen this youngster had on one of them cowboy suits such as tenderfoots bring west with em and you could see he was aching to wing a couple of indians or bag a grizzly or two with the little pearl handled gun he had buckled around his waist i walked down to the depot to keep an eye on the outfit and see that they didn t locate any land or scare the cow ponies hitched in front of murchison s store or act otherwise unseemly luke was away after a gang of cattle thieves down on the frio and i always looked after the law and order when he wasn t there after dinner this boy comes out of the dining room while the train was waiting and prances up and down the platform ready to shoot all antelope lions or private citizens that might endeavour to molest or come too near him he was a good looking kid only he was like all them tenderfoots he didn t know a law and order town when he saw it by and by along comes pedro johnson the proprietor of the crystal palace chili con carne stand in bildad pedro was a man who liked to amuse himself so he kind of herd rides this youngster laughing at him tickled to death i was too far away to hear but the kid seems to mention some remarks to pedro and pedro goes up and slaps him about nine feet away and laughs harder than ever and then the boy gets up quicker than he fell and jerks out his little pearl handle and bing bing bing pedro gets it three times in special and treasured portions of his carcass i saw the dust fly off his clothes every time the bullets hit sometimes them little thirty twos cause worry at close range the engine bell was ringing and the train starting off slow i goes up to the kid and places him under arrest and takes away his gun but the first thing i knew that caballard of capitalists makes a break for the train one of em hesitates in front of me for a second and kind of smiles and shoves his hand up against my chin and i sort of laid down on the platform and took a nap i never was afraid of guns but i don t want any person except a barber to take liberties like that with my face again when i woke up the whole outfit train boy and all was gone i asked about pedro and they told me the doctor said he would recover provided his wounds didn t turn out to be fatal when luke got back three days later and i told him about it he was mad all over why n t you telegraph to san antone he asks and have the bunch arrested there oh well says i i always did admire telegraphy but astronomy was what i had took up just then that capitalist sure knew how to gesticulate with his hands luke got madder and madder he investigates and finds in the depot a card one of the men had dropped that gives the address of some hombre called scudder in new york city bud says luke i m going after that bunch i m going there and get the man or boy as you say he was and bring him back i m sheriff of mojada county and i shall keep law and order in its precincts while i m able to draw a gun and i want you to go with me no eastern yankee can shoot up a respectable and well known citizen of bildad specially with a thirty two calibre and escape the law pedro johnson says luke is one of our most prominent citizens and business men i ll appoint sam bel l acting sheriff with penitentiary powers while i m away and you and me will take the six forty five northbound to morrow evening and follow up this trail i m your company says i i never see this new york but i d like to but luke says i don t you have to have a dispensation or a habeas corpus or something from the state when you reach out that far for rich men and malefactors did i have a requisition says luke when i went over into the brazos bottoms and brought back bill grimes and two more for holding up the international did me and you have a search warrant or a posse comitatus when we rounded up them six mexican cow thieves down in hidalgo it s my business to keep order in mojada county and it s my business as office deputy says i to see that business is carried on according to law between us both we ought to keep things pretty well cleaned up so the next day luke packs a blanket and some collars and his mileage book in a haversack and him and me hits the breeze for new york it was a powerful long ride the seats in the cars was too short for six footers like us to sleep comfortable on and the conductor had to keep us from getting off at every town that had five story houses in it but we got there finally and we seemed to see right away that he was right about it luke says i as office deputy and from a law standpoint it don t look to me like this place is properly and legally in the jurisdiction of mojada county texas from the standpoint of order says he it s amenable to answer for its sins to the properly appointed authorities from bildad to jerusalem amen says i but let s turn our trick sudden and ride i don t like the looks of this place think of pedro johnson says luke a friend of mine and yours shot down by one of these gilded abolitionists at his very door it was at the door of the freight depot says i but the law will not be balked at a quibble like that we put up at one of them big hotels on broadway the next morning i goes down about two miles of stairsteps to the bottom and hunts for luke it ain t no use it looks like san jacinto day in san antone there s a thousand folks milling around in a kind of a roofed over plaza with marble pavements and trees growing right out of em and i see no more chance of finding luke than if we was hunting each other in the big pear flat down below old fort ewell but soon luke and me runs together in one of the turns of them marble alleys it ain t no use bud says he i can t find no place to eat at i ve been looking for restaurant signs and smelling for ham all over the camp but i m used to going hungry when i have to now says he i m going out and get a hack and ride down to the address on this scudder card you stay here and try to hustle some grub but i doubt if you ll find it i wish we d brought along some cornmeal and bacon and beans i ll be back when i see this scudder if the trail ain t wiped out so i starts foraging for breakfast for the honour of old mojada county i didn t want to seem green to them abolitionists so every time i turned a corner in them marble halls i went up to the first desk or counter i see and looks around for grub if i didn t see what i wanted i asked for something else in about half an hour i had a dozen cigars five story magazines and seven or eight railroad time tables in my pockets and never a smell of coffee or bacon to point out the trail once a lady sitting at a table and playing a game kind of like pushpin told me to go into a closet that she called number i went in and shut the door and the blamed thing lit itself up i set down on a stool before a shelf and waited thinks i this is a private dining room but no waiter never came when i got to sweating good and hard i goes out again did you get what you wanted says she no ma am says i not a bite then there s no charge says she thanky ma am says i and i takes up the trail again by and by i thinks i ll shed etiquette and i picks up one of them boys with blue clothes and yellow buttons in front and he leads me to what he calls the caffay breakfast room and the first thing i lays my eyes on when i go in is that boy that had shot pedro johnson he was setting all alone at a little table hitting a egg with a spoon like he was afraid he d break it i takes the chair across the table from him and he looks insulted and makes a move like he was going to get up keep still son says i you re apprehended arrested and in charge of the texas authorities go on and hammer that egg some more if it s the inside of it you want now what did you shoot mr johnson of bildad for and may i ask who you are says he you may says i go ahead i suppose you re on says this kid without batting his eyes but what are you eating here waiter he calls out raising his finger take this gentleman s order a beefsteak says i and some fried eggs and a can of peaches and a quart of coffee will about suffice we talk awhile about the sundries of life and then he says what are you going to do about that shooting i had a right to shoot that man says he

scudder got active with one of these telephones as soon as he left for in about an hour afterward there comes to our hotel some of these city rangers in everyday clothes that they call detectives and marches the whole outfit of us to what they call a magistrate s court they accuse luke of at tempted kidnapping and ask him what he has to say this snipe says luke to the judge shot and wilfully

luke that don t amount to anything that fellow was half mexican anyhow transformation of martin burney in behalf of sir walter s soothing plant let us look into the case of martin burney they were constructing the speedway along the west bank of the harlem river the grub boat of dennis corrigan sub contractor was moored to a tree on the bank twenty two men belonging to the little green island toiled there at the sinew cracking labour one among them who wrought in the kitchen of the grub boat was of the race of the goths over them all stood the exorbitant corrigan harrying them like the captain of a galley crew he paid them so little that most of the gang work as they might e arned little more than food and tobacco many of them were in debt to him corrigan boarded them all in the grub boat and gave them good grub for he got it back in work martin burney was furthest behind of all he was a little man all muscles and hands and feet with a gray red stubbly beard he was too light for the work which would have glutted the capacity of a steam shovel the work was hard besides that the banks of the river were humming with mosquitoes as a child in a dark room fixes his regard on the pale light of a comforting window these toilers watched the sun that brought around the one hour of the day that tasted less bitter after the sundown supper they would huddle together on the river bank and send the mosquitoes whining and eddying back from the malignant puffs of twenty three reeking pipes thus socially banded against the foe they wrenched out of the hour a few well smoked drops from the cup of joy each week burney grew deeper in debt corrigan kept a small stock of goods on the boat which he sold to the men at prices that brought him no loss burney was a good customer at the tobacco counter one sack when he went to work in the morning and one when he came in at night so much was his account swelled daily burney was something of a smoker yet it was not true that he ate his meals with a pipe in his mouth which had been said of him the little man was not discontented he had plenty to eat plenty of tobacco and a tyrant to curse so why should not he an irishman be well satisfied one morning as he was starting with the others for work he stopped at the pine counter for his usual sack of tobacco there s no more for ye said corrigan your account s closed ye are a losing investment no not even tobaccy my son no more tobaccy on account if ye want to work on and eat do so but the smoke of ye has all ascended tis my advice that ye hunt a new job i have no tobaccy to smoke in my pipe this day mr corrigan said burney not quite understanding that such a thing could happen to him earn it said corrigan and then buy it burney stayed on he knew of no other job at first he did not realize that tobacco had got to be his father and mother his confessor and sweetheart and wife and child for three days he managed to fill his pipe from the other men s sacks and then they shut him off one and all they told him rough but friendly that of all things in the world tobacco must be quickest forthcoming to a fellow man desiring it but that beyond the immediate temporary need requisition upon the store of a comrade is pressed with great danger to friendship then the blackness of the pit arose and filled the heart of burney sucking the corpse of his deceased dudheen he staggered through his duties with his barrowful of stones and dirt feeling for the first time that the curse of adam was upon him other men bereft of a pleasure might have recourse to other delights but burney had only two comforts in life one was his pipe the other was an ecstatic hope that there would be no speedways to build on the other side of jordan at meal times he would let the other men go first into the grub boat and then he would go down on his hands and knees grovelling fiercely upon the ground where they had been sitting trying to find some stray crumbs of tobacco once he sneaked down the river bank and filled his pipe with dead willow leaves at the first whiff of the smoke he spat in the direction of the boat and put the finest curse he knew on corrigan one that began with the first corrigans born on earth and ended with the corrigans that shall hear the trumpet of gabriel blow he began to hate corrigan with all his shaking nerves and soul even murder occurred to him in a vague sort of way five days he went without the taste of tobacco he who had smoked all day and thought the night misspent in which he had not awakened for a pipeful or two under the bedclothes one day a man stopped at the boat to say that there was work to be had in the bronx park where a large number of labourers were required in making some improvements after dinner burney walked thirty yards down the river bank away from the maddening smell of the others pipes he sat down upon a stone he was thinking he would set out for the bronx at least he could earn tobacco there what if the books did say he owed corrigan any man s work was worth his keep but then he hated to go without getting even with the hard hearted screw who had put his pipe out was there any way to do it softly stepping among the clods came tony he of the race of goths who worked in the kitchen he grinned at burney s elbow and that unhappy man full of race animosity and holding urbanity in contempt growled at him what d ye want ye dago tony also contained a grievance and a plot he too was a corrigan hater and had been primed to see it in others how you like a mr corrigan he asked you think a him a nice a man to hell with m he said may his liver turn to water and the bones of him crack in the cold of his heart may dog fennel grow upon his ancestors graves and the grandsons of his children be born without eyes may whiskey turn to clabber in his mouth and every time he sneezes may he blister the soles of his feet and the smoke of his pipe may it make his eyes water and the drops fall on the grass that his cows eat and poison the butter that he spreads on his bread though tony remained a stranger to the beauties of this imagery he gathered from it the conviction that it was sufficiently anti corrigan in its tendency so with the confidence of a fellow conspirator he sat by burney upon the stone and unfolded his plot it was very simple in design every day after dinner it was corrigan s habit to sleep for an hour in his bunk at such times it was the duty of the cook and his helper tony to leave the boat so that no noise might disturb the autocrat the cook always spent this hour in walking exercise tony s plan was this after corrigan should be asleep he tony and burney would cut the mooring ropes that held the boat to the shore tony lacked the nerve to do the deed alone then the awkward boat would swing out into a swift current and surely overturn against a rock there was below come on and do it said burney if the back of ye aches from the lick he gave ye as the pit of me stomach does for the taste of a bit of smoke we can t cut the ropes too quick all a right said tony but better wait bout a ten minute more give a corrigan plenty time get good a sleep they waited sitting upon the stone the rest of the men were at work out of sight around a bend in the road everything would have gone well except perhaps with corrigan had not tony been moved to decorate the plot with its conventional accompaniment he was of dramatic blood and perhaps he intuitively divined the appendage to villainous machinations as prescribed by the stage he pulled from his shirt bosom a long black beautiful venomous cigar and handed it to burney you like a smoke while we wait he asked burney clutched it and snapped off the end as a terrier bites at a rat he laid it to his lips like a long lost sweetheart when the smoke began to draw he gave a long deep sigh and the bristles of his gray red moustache curled down over the cigar like the talons of an eagle slowly the red faded from the whites of his eyes he fixed his gaze dreamily upon the hills across the river the minutes came and went bout time to go now said tony that damn a corrigan he be in the reever very quick burney started out of his trance with a grunt he turned his head and gazed with a surprised and pained severity at his accomplice he took the cigar partly from his mouth but sucked it back again immediately chewed it lovingly once or twice and spoke in virulent puffs from the corner of his mouth what is it ye yaller haythen would ye lay contrivances against the enlightened races of the earth ye instigator of illegal crimes would ye seek to persuade martin burney into the dirty tricks of an indecent dago would ye be for murderin your benefactor the good man that gives ye food and work take that ye punkin coloured assassin the torrent of burney s indignation carried with it bodily assault the toe of his shoe sent the would be cutter of ropes tumbling from his seat tony arose and fled his vendetta he again relegated to the files of things that might have been beyond the boat he fled and away away he was afraid to remain burney with expanded chest watched his late coplotter disappear then he too departed setting his face in the direction of the bronx in his wake was a rank and pernicious trail of noisome smoke that brought peace to his heart and drove the birds from the roadside into the deepest thickets the caliph and the cad surely there is no pastime more diverting than that of mingling incognito with persons of wealth and station where else but in those circles can one see life in its primitive crude state unhampered by the conventions that bind the dwellers in a lower sphere there was a certain caliph of bagdad who was accustomed to go down among the poor and lowly for the solace obtained from the relation of their tales and histories is it not strange that the humble and poverty stricken have not availed themselves of the pleasure they might glean by donning diamonds and silks and playing caliph among the haunts of the upper world there was one who saw the possibilities of thus turning the tables on haroun al raschid his name was corny brannigan and he was a truck driver for a canal street importing firm and if you read further you will learn how he turned upper broadway into bagdad and learned something about himself that he did not know before many people would have called corny a snob preferably by means of a telephone his chief interest in life his chosen amusement and his sole diversion after working hours was to place himself in juxtaposition since he could not hope to mingle with people of fashion and means every evening after corny had put up his team and dined at a lunch counter that made immediateness a specialty he would clothe himself in evening raiment as correct as any you will see in the palm rooms then he would betake himself to that ravishing radiant roadway devoted to thespis thais and bacchus for a time he would stroll about the lobbies of the best hotels his soul steeped in blissful content beautiful women cooing like doves but feathered like birds of paradise flicked him with their robes as they passed courtly gentlemen attended them gallant and assiduous and corny s heart within him swelled like sir lancelot s for the mirror spoke to him as he passed and said corny lad there s not a guy among em that looks a bit the sweller than yerself and you drivin of a truck and them swearin off their taxes and playin the red in art galleries with the best in the land and the mirrors spake the truth mr corny brannigan had acquired the outward polish if nothing more long and keen observation of polite society had gained for him its manner its genteel air and most difficult of acquirement its repose and ease now and then in the hotels corny had managed conversation and temporary acquaintance with substantial if not distinguished guests with many of these he had exchanged cards and the ones he received he carefully treasured for his own use later leaving the hotel lobbies corny would stroll leisurely about lingering at the theatre entrance dropping into the fashionable restaurants as if seeking some friend he rarely patronized any of these places he was no bee come to suck honey but a butterfly flashing his wings among the flowers whose calyces held no sweets for him his wages were not large enough to furnish him with more than the outside garb of the gentleman to have been one of the beings he so cunningly imitated corny brannigan would have given his right hand one night corny had an adventure after absorbing the delights of an hour s lounging in the principal hotels along broadway he passed up into the stronghold of thespis cab drivers hailed him as a likely fare to his prideful content languishing eyes were turned upon him as a hopeful source of lobsters and the delectable ascendant globules of effervescence these overtures and unconscious compliments corny swallowed as manna and hoped bill the off horse would be less lame in the left forefoot in the morning beneath a cluster of milky globes of electric light corny paused to admire the sheen of his low cut patent leather shoes the building occupying the angle was a pretentious cafe out of this came a couple a lady in a white cobwebby evening gown with a lace wrap like a wreath of mist thrown over it and a man tall faultless assured too assured they moved to the edge of the sidewalk and halted corny s eye ever alert for pointers in swell behaviour took them in with a sidelong glance the carriage is not here said the lady you ordered it to wait i ordered it for nine thirty said the man it should be here now a familiar note in the lady s voice drew a more especial attention from corny it was pitched in a key well known to him the soft electric shone upon her face sisters of sorrow have no quarters fixed for them in the index to the book of breaking hearts you will find that broadway follows very soon after the bowery this lady s face was sad and her voice was attuned with it they waited as if for the carriage corny waited too for it was out of doors and he was never tired of accumulating and profiting by knowledge of gentlemanly conduct jack said the lady don t be angry i ve done everything i could to please you this evening why do you act so oh you re an angel said the man depend upon woman to throw the blame upon a man i m not blaming you i m only trying to make you happy you go about it in a very peculiar way you have been cross with me all the evening without any cause oh there isn t any cause except you make me tired corny took out his card case and looked over his collection he selected one that read mr r lionel whyte melville bloomsbury square london this card he had inveigled from a tourist at the king edward hotel corny stepped up to the man and presented it with a correctly formal air may i ask why i am selected for the honour asked the lady s escort now mr corny brannigan had a very wise habit of saying little during his imitations of the caliph of bagdad the advice of lord chesterfield wear a black coat and hold your tongue he believed in without having heard but now speech was demanded and required of him no gent said corny would talk to a lady like you done fie upon you willie even if she happens to be your wife you ought to have more respect for your clothes than to chin her back that way maybe it ain t my butt in but it goes anyhow you strike me as bein a whole lot to the wrong the lady s escort indulged in more elegantly expressed but fetching repartee corny eschewing his truck driver s vocabulary retorted as nearly as he could in polite phrases then diplomatic relations were severed there was a brief but lively set to with other than oral weapons from which corny came forth easily victor a carriage dashed up driven by a tardy and solicitous coachman will you kindly open the door for me asked the lady corny assisted her to enter and took off his hat the escort was beginning to scramble up from the sidewalk i beg your pardon ma am said corny if he s your man he s no man of mine said the lady perhaps he but there s no chance of his being now drive home michael if you care to take this with my thanks three red roses were thrust out through the carriage window into corny s hand he took them and the hand for an instant and then the carriage sped away corny gathered his foe s hat and began to brush the dust from his clothes come along said corny taking the other man by the arm his late opponent was yet a little dazed by the hard knocks he had received corny led him carefully into a saloon three doors away the drinks for us said corny me and my friend you re a queer feller said the lady s late escort lick a man and then want to set em up you re my best friend said corny exultantly you don t understand well listen you just put me wise to somethin i been playin gent a long time thinkin it was just the glad rags i had and nothin else say you re a swell ain t you well you trot in that class i guess i don t but i found out one thing i m a gentleman by and i know it now what ll you have to drink the diamond of kali the original news item concerning the diamond of the goddess kali was handed in to the city editor he smiled and held it for a moment above the wastebasket then he laid it back on his desk and said try the sunday people they might work something out of it the sunday editor glanced the item over and said h m afterward he sent for a reporter and expanded his comment you might see general ludlow he said and make a story out of this if you can diamond stories are a drug but this one is big enough to be found by a scrubwoman wrapped up in a piece of newspaper and tucked under the corner of the hall linoleum find out first if the general has a daughter who intends to go on the stage if not you can go ahead with the story run cuts of the kohinoor and j p morgan s collection and work in pictures of the kimberley mines and barney barnato fill in with a tabulated comparison of the values of diamonds radium and veal cutlets since the meat strike and let it run to a half page on the following day the reporter turned in his story the sunday editor let his eye sprint along its lines h m he said again this time the copy went into the waste basket with scarcely a flutter the reporter stiffened a little around the lips but he was whistling softly and contentedly between his teeth when i went over to talk with him about it an hour later i don t blame the old man said he magnanimously for cutting it out it did sound like funny business but it happened exactly as i wrote it say why don t you fish that story out of the w b and use it seems to me it s as good as the tommyrot you write i accepted the tip and if you read further you will learn the facts about the diamond of the goddess kali as vouched for by one of the most reliable reporters on the staff gen marcellus b ludlow lives in one of those decaying but venerated old red brick mansions in the west twenties the general is a member of an old new york family that does not advertise he is a globe trotter by birth a gentleman by predilection a millionaire by the mercy of heaven and a connoisseur of precious stones by occupation the reporter was admitted promptly when he made himself known at the general s residence at about eight thirty on the evening that he received the assignment in the magnificent library he was greeted by the distinguished traveller and connoisseur a tall erect gentleman in the early fifties with a nearly white moustache and a bearing so soldierly that one perceived in him scarcely a trace of the national guardsman his weather beaten countenance lit up with a charming smile of interest when the reporter made known his errand ah you have heard of my latest find i shall be glad to show you what i conceive to be one of the six most valuable blue diamonds in existence the general opened a small safe in a corner of the library and brought forth a plush covered box opening this he exposed to the reporter s bewildered gaze a huge and brilliant diamond nearly as large as a hailstone this stone said the general is something more than a mere jewel it once formed the central eye of the three eyed goddess kali who is worshipped by one of the fiercest and most fanatical tribes of india if you will arrange yourself comfortably i will give you a brief history of it for your paper general ludlow brought a decanter of whiskey and glasses from a cabinet and set a comfortable armchair for the lucky scribe the phansigars or thugs of india began the general are the most dangerous and dreaded of the tribes of north india they are extremists in religion and worship the horrid goddess kali in the form of images their rites are interesting and bloody the robbing and murdering of travellers are taught as a worthy and obligatory deed by their strange religious code their worship of the three eyed goddess kali is conducted so secretly that no traveller has ever heretofore had the honour of witnessing the ceremonies that distinction was reserved for myself while at sakaranpur between delhi and khelat i used to explore the jungle in every direction in the hope of learning something new about these mysterious phansigars one evening at twilight i was making my way through a teakwood forest when i came upon a deep circular depression in an open space in the centre of which was a rude stone temple i was sure that this was one of the temples of the thugs so i concealed myself in the undergrowth to watch when the moon rose the depression in the clearing was suddenly filled with hundreds of shadowy swiftly gliding forms then a door opened in the temple exposing a brightly illuminated image of the goddess kali before which a white robed priest began a barbarous incantation while the tribe of worshippers prostrated themselves upon the earth but what interested me most was the central eye of the huge wooden idol i could see by its flashing brilliancy that it was an immense diamond of the purest water after the rites were concluded the thugs slipped away into the forest as silently as they had come the priest stood for a few minutes in the door of the temple enjoying the cool of the night before closing his rather warm quarters suddenly a dark lithe shadow slipped down into the hollow leaped upon the priest and struck him down with a glittering knife then the murderer sprang at the image of the goddess like a cat and pried out the glowing central eye of kali with his weapon straight toward me he ran with his royal prize when he was within two paces i rose to my feet and struck him with all my force between the eyes he rolled over senseless and the magnificent jewel fell from his hand that is the splendid blue diamond you have just seen a stone worthy of a monarch s crown that s a corking story said the reporter that decanter is exactly like the one that john w gates always sets out during an interview pardon me said general ludlow for forgetting hospitality in the excitement of my narrative help yourself here s looking at you said the reporter what i am afraid of now said the general lowering his voice is that i may be robbed of the diamond the jewel that formed an eye of their goddess is their most sacred symbol somehow the tribe suspected me of having it and members of the band have followed me half around the earth they are the most cunning and cruel fanatics in the world and their religious vows would compel them to assassinate the unbeliever who has desecrated their sacred treasure once in lucknow three of their agents disguised as servants in a hotel endeavoured to strangle me with a twisted cloth again in london two thugs made up as street musicians climbed into my window at night and attacked me they have even tracked me to this country my life is never safe a month ago while i was at a hotel in the berkshires three of them sprang upon me from the roadside weeds i saved myself then by my knowledge of their customs how was that general asked the reporter there was a cow grazing near by said general ludlow a gentle jersey cow i ran to her side and stood the three thugs ceased their attack knelt and struck the ground thrice with their foreheads then after many respectful salaams they departed afraid the cow would hook asked the reporter no the cow is a sacred animal to the phansigars next to their goddess they worship the cow they have never been known to commit any deed of violence in the presence of the animal they reverence it s a mighty interesting story said the reporter if you don t mind i ll take another drink and then a few notes i will join you said general ludlow with a courteous wave of his hand if i were you advised the reporter i d take that sparkler to texas get on a cow ranch there and the pharisees phansigars corrected the general oh yes the fancy guys would run up against a long horn every time they made a break general ludlow closed the diamond case and thrust it into his bosom the spies of the tribe have found me out in new york he said straightening his tall figure i m familiar with the east indian cast of countenance and i know that my every movement is watched they will undoubtedly attempt to rob and murder me here here exclaimed the reporter seizing the decanter and pouring out a liberal amount of its contents at any moment said the general but as a soldier and a connoisseur i shall sell my life and my diamond as dearly as i can at this point of the reporter s story there is a certain vagueness but it can be gathered that there was a loud crashing noise at the rear of the house they were in general ludlow buttoned his coat closely and sprang for the door but the reporter clutched him firmly with one hand while he held the decanter with the other tell me before we fly he urged in a voice thick with some inward turmoil do any of your daughters contemplate going on the stage i have no daughters fly for your life the phansigars are upon us cried the general the two men dashed out of the front door of the house the hour was late as their feet struck the side walk strange men of dark and forbidding appearance seemed to rise up out of the earth and encompass them one with asiatic features pressed close to the general and droned in a terrible voice buy cast clo another dark whiskered and sinister sped lithely to his side and began in a whining voice say mister have yer got a dime fer a poor feller what they hurried on but only into the arms of a black eyed dusky browed being who held out his hat under their noses while a confederate of oriental hue turned the handle of a street organ near by twenty steps farther on general ludlow and the reporter found themselves in the midst of half a dozen villainous looking men with high turned coat collars and faces bristling with unshaven beards run for it hissed the general they have discovered the possessor of the diamond of the goddess kali the two men took to their heels the avengers of the goddess pursued oh lordy groaned the reporter there isn t a cow this side of brooklyn we re lost when near the corner they both fell over an iron object that rose from the sidewalk close to the gutter clinging to it desperately they awaited their fate if i only had a cow moaned the reporter or another nip from that decanter general as soon as the pursuers observed where their victims had found refuge they suddenly fell back and retreated to a considerable distance they are waiting for reinforcements in order to attack us said general ludlow but the reporter emitted a ringing laugh and hurled his hat triumphantly into the air guess again he shouted and leaned heavily upon the iron object your old fancy guys or thugs whatever you call em are up to date dear general this is a pump we ve stranded upon same as a cow in new york hic see thas h why the nfuriated smoked guys don t attack us see sacred an mal the pump in n york my dear general but further down in the shadows of twenty eighth street the marauders were holding a parley come on reddy said one let s go frisk the old un he s been shown a sparkler as big as a hen egg all around eighth avenue for two weeks past not on your silhouette decided reddy you see em rallyin round the pump they re friends of bill s bill won t stand for nothin of this kind in his district since he got that bid to esopus this exhausts the facts concerning the kali diamond but it is deemed not inconsequent to close with the following brief paid item that appeared two days later in a morning paper it is rumored that a niece of gen marcellus b ludlow of new york city will appear on the stage next season her diamonds are said to be extremely valuable and of much historic interest the day we celebrate in the tropics hop along bibb the bird fancier was saying to me the seasons months fortnights week ends holidays dog days sundays and yesterdays get so jumbled together in the shuffle that you never know when a year has gone by until you re in the middle of the next one hop along bibb kept his bird store on lower fourth avenue he was an ex seaman and beachcomber who made regular voyages to southern ports and imported personally conducted invoices of talking parrots and dialectic paroquets he had a stiff knee neck and nerve i had gone to him to buy a parrot to present at christmas to my aunt joanna this one said i disregarding his homily on the subdivisions of time this one that seems all red white and blue to what genus of beasts does he belong he appeals at once to my patriotism and to my love of discord in colour schemes that s a cockatoo from ecuador said bibb all he has been taught to say is merry christmas a seasonable bird he s only seven dollars and i ll bet many a human has stuck you for more money by making the same speech to you and then bibb laughed suddenly and loudly that bird he explained reminds me he s got his dates mixed he ought to be saying e pluri bus unum to match his feathers instead of trying to work the santa claus graft it reminds me of the time me and liverpool sam got our ideas of things tangled up on the coast of costa rica on account of the weather and other phenomena to be met with in the tropics we were as it were stranded on that section of the spanish main with no money to speak of and no friends that should be talked about either we had stoked and second cooked ourselves down there on a fruit steamer from new orleans to try our luck which was discharged after we got there for lack of evidence there was no work suitable to our instincts so me and liverpool began to subsist on the red rum of the country and such fruit as we could reap where we had not sown it was an alluvial town called soledad where there was no harbour or future or recourse between steamers the town slept and drank rum it only woke up when there were bananas to ship it was like a man sleeping through dinner until the dessert when me and liverpool got so low down that the american consul wouldn t speak to us we knew we d struck bed rock we boarded with a snuff brown lady named chica who kept a rum shop and a ladies and gents restaurant in a street called the calle de los forty seven inconsolable saints when our credit played out there liverpool whose stomach overshadowed his sensations of noblesse oblige married chica this kept us in rice and fried plantain for a month and then chica pounded liverpool one morning sadly and earnestly for fifteen minutes with a casserole handed down from the stone age and we knew that we had out welcomed our liver that night we signed an engagement with don jaime mcspinosa a hybrid banana fancier of the place to work on his fruit preserves nine miles out of town we had to do it or be reduced to sea water and broken doses of feed and slumber now speaking of liverpool sam i don t malign or inexculpate him to you any more than i would to his face but in my opinion when an englishman gets as low as he can he s got to dodge so that the dregs of other nations don t drop ballast on him out of their balloons and if he s a liverpool englishman why fire damp is what he s got to look out for being a natural american that s my personal view but liverpool and me had much in common we were without decorous clothes or ways and means of exist ence and as the saying goes misery certainly does enjoy the society of accomplices our job on old mcspinosa s plantation was chopping down banana stalks and loading the bunches of fruit on the backs of horses then a native dressed up in an alligator hide belt a machete and a pair of aa sheeting pajamas drives em over to the coast and piles em up on the beach you ever been in a banana grove it s as solemn as a rathskeller at seven a m it s like being lost behind the scenes at one of these mushroom musical shows you can t see the sky for the foliage above you and the ground is knee deep in rotten leaves and it s so still that you can hear the stalks growing again after you chop em down at night me and liverpool herded in a lot of grass huts on the edge of a lagoon with the red yellow and black employes of don jaime there we lay fighting mosquitoes and listening to the monkeys squalling and the alligators grunting and splashing in the lagoon until daylight with only snatches of sleep between times we soon lost all idea of what time of the year it was it s just about eighty degrees there in december and june and on fridays and at midnight and election day and any other old time sometimes it rains more than at others and that s all the difference you notice a man is liable to live along there without noticing any fugiting of tempus until some day the undertaker calls in for him just when he s beginning to think about cutting out the gang and saving up a little to invest in real estate i don t know how long we worked for don jaime but it was through two or thee rainy spells eight or ten hair cuts and the life of thee pairs of sail cloth trousers all the money we earned went for rum and tobacco but we ate and that was something all of a sudden one day me and liverpool find the trade of committing surgical operations on banana stalks turning to aloes and quinine in our mouths it s a seizure that often comes upon white men in latin and geographical countries we wanted to be addressed again in language and see the smoke of a steamer and read the real estate transfers and gents outfitting ads in an old newspaper even soledad seemed like a centre of civilization to us so that evening we put our thumbs on our nose at don jaime s fruit stand and shook his grass burrs off our feet it was only twelve miles to soledad but it took me and liverpool two days to get there it was banana grove nearly all the way and we got twisted time and again it was like paging the palm room of a new york hotel for a man named smith when we saw the houses of soledad between the trees all my disinclination toward this liverpool sam rose up in me i stood him while we were two white men against the banana brindles but now when there were prospects of my exchanging even cuss words with an american citizen i put him back in his proper place and he was a sight too with his rum painted nose and his red whiskers and elephant feet with leather sandals strapped to them i suppose i looked about the same it looks to me says i like great britain ought to be made to keep such gin swilling scurvy unbecoming mud larks as you at home instead of sending em over here to degrade and taint foreign lands we kicked you out of america once and we ought to put on rubber boots and do it again oh you go to ell says liverpool which was about all the repartee he ever had well soledad looked fine to me after don jaime s plantation liverpool and me walked into it side by side from force of habit past the calabosa and the hotel grande down across the plaza toward chica s hut where we hoped that liverpool being a husband of hers might work his luck for a meal as we passed the two story little frame house occupied by the american club we noticed that the balcony had been decorated all around with wreaths of evergreens and flowers and the flag was flying from the pole on the roof stanzey the consul and ark right a gold mine owner were smoking on the balcony me and liverpool waved our dirty hands toward em and smiled real society smiles but they turned their backs to us and went on talking and we had played whist once with the two of em up to the ti me when liverpool held all thirteen trumps for four hands in succession it was some holiday we knew but we didn t know the day nor the year a little further along we saw a reverend man named pendergast who had come to soledad to build a church standing under a cocoanut palm with his little black alpaca coat and green umbrella boys boys says he through his blue spectacles is it as bad as this are you so far reduced we re reduced says i to very vulgar fractions it is indeed sad says pendergast to see my countrymen in such circumstances cut arf of that out old party says liverpool cawn t you tell a member of the british upper classes when you see one shut up i told liverpool you re on foreign soil now or that portion of it that s not on you and on this day too goes on pendergast grievous on this most glorious day of the year when we should all be celebrating the dawn of christian civilization and the downfall of the wicked i did notice bunting and bouquets decorating the town reverend says i but i didn t know what it was for we ve been so long out of touch with calendars that we didn t know whether it was summer time or saturday afternoon here is two dollars says pendergast digging up two chili silver wheels and handing em to me go my men and observe the rest of the day in a befitting manner me and liverpool thanked him kindly and walked away shall we eat i asks oh ell says liverpool what s money for very well then i says since you insist upon it we ll drink so we pull up in a rum shop and get a quart of it and go down on the beach under a cocoanut tree and celebrate not having eaten anything but oranges in two days the rum has immediate effect and once more i conjure up great repugnance toward the british nation stand up here i says to liverpool you scum of a despot limited monarchy and have another dose of bunker hill that good man mr pendergast says i said we were to observe the day in a befitting manner and i m not going to see his money misapplied oh you go to ell says liverpool and i started in with a fine left hander on his right eye liverpool had been a fighter once but dissipation and bad company had taken the nerve out of him in ten minutes i had him lying on the sand waving the white flag get up says i kicking him in the ribs and come along with me liverpool got up and followed behind me because it was his habit wiping the red off his face and nose i led him to reverend pendergast s shack and called him out look at this sir says i look at this thing that was once a proud britisher you gave us two dollars and told us to celebrate the day the star spangled banner still waves hurrah for the stars and eagles dear me says pendergast holding up his hands fighting on this day of all days on christmas day when peace on christmas hell says i i thought it was the fourth of july merry christmas said the red white and blue cockatoo take him for six dollars said hop along bibb he s got his dates and colours mixed the trimmed lamp and other stories the trimmed lamp of course there are two sides to the question let us look at the other we often hear shop girls spoken of no such persons exist there are girls who work in shops they make their living that way but why turn their occupation into an adjective let us be fair we do not refer to the girls who live on fifth avenue as marriage girls lou and nancy were chums they came to the big city to find work because there was not enough to eat at their homes to go around nancy was nineteen lou was twenty both were pretty active country girls who had no ambition to go on the stage the little cherub that sits up aloft guided them to a cheap and respectable boarding house both found positions and became wage earners they remained chums it is at the end of six months that i would beg you to step forward and be introduced to them meddlesome reader my lady friends miss nancy and miss lou while you are shaking hands please take notice cautiously of their attire yes cautiously for they are as quick to resent a stare as a lady in a box at the horse show is lou is a piece work ironer in a hand laundry she is clothed in a badly fitting purple dress and her hat plume is four inches too long but her ermine muff and scarf cost and its fellow beasts will be ticketed in the windows at before the season is over her cheeks are pink and her light blue eyes bright contentment radiates from her nancy you would call a shop girl because you have the habit there is no type but a perverse generation is always seeking a type so this is what the type should be she has the high ratted pompadour and the exaggerated straight front her skirt is shoddy but has the correct flare no furs protect her against the bitter spring air but she wears her short broadcloth jacket as jauntily as though it were persian lamb on her face and in her eyes remorseless type seeker is the typical shop girl expression it is a look of silent but contemptuous revolt against cheated womanhood of sad prophecy of the vengeance to come when she laughs her loudest the look is still there the same look can be seen in the eyes of russian peasants and those of us left will see it some day on gabriel s face when he comes to blow us up it is a look that should wither and abash man but he has been known to smirk at it and offer flowers with a string tied to them now lift your hat and come away while you receive lou s cheery see you again and the sardonic sweet smile of nancy that seems somehow to miss you and go fluttering like a white moth up over the housetops to the stars the two waited on the corner for dan dan was lou s steady company faithful well he was on hand when mary would have had to hire a dozen subpoena servers to find her lamb ain t you cold nance said lou say what a chump you are for working in that old store for a week i made l last week of course ironing ain t as swell work as selling lace behind a counter but it pays none of us ironers make less than and i don t know that it s any less respectful work either you can have it said nancy with uplifted nose i ll take my eight a week and hall bedroom i like to be among nice things and swell people and look what a chance i ve got why one of our glove girls married a pittsburg steel maker or blacksmith or something the other day worth a million dollars i ll catch a swell myself some time i ain t bragging on my looks or anything but i ll take my chances where there s big prizes offered what show would a girl have in a laundry why that s where i met dan said lou triumphantly he came in for his sunday shirt and collars and saw me at the first board ironing we all try to get to work at the first board ella maginnis was sick that day and i had her place he said he noticed any arms first how round and white they was i had my sleeves rolled up some nice fellows come into laundries you can tell em by their bringing their clothes in suit cases and turning in the door sharp and sudden how can you wear a waist like that lou said nancy gazing down at the offending article with sweet scorn in her heavy lidded eyes it shows fierce taste this waist cried lou with wide eyed indignation why i paid for this waist it s worth twenty five a woman left it to be laundered and never called for it the boss sold it to me it s got yards and yards of hand embroidery on it better talk about that ugly plain thing you ve got on this ugly plain thing said nancy calmly was copied from one that mrs van alstyne fisher was wearing the girls say her bill in the store last year was i made mine myself it cost me ten feet away you couldn t tell it from hers oh well said lou good naturedly if you want to starve and put on airs go ahead but i ll take my job and good wages and after hours give me something as fancy and attractive to wear as i am able to buy but just then dan came a serious young man with a ready made necktie who had escaped the city s brand of frivolity an electrician earning dollars per week who looked upon lou with the sad eyes of romeo and thought her embroidered waist a web in which any fly should delight to be caught my friend mr owens shake hands with miss danforth said lou i m mighty glad to know you miss danforth said dan with outstretched hand i ve heard lou speak of you so often thanks said nancy touching his fingers with the tips of her cool ones i ve heard her mention you a few times lou giggled did you get that handshake from mrs van alstyne fisher nance she asked if i did you can feel safe in copying it said nancy oh i couldn t use it at all it s too stylish for me it s intended to set off diamond rings that high shake is wait till i get a few and then i ll try it learn it first said nancy wisely and you ll be more likely to get the rings now to settle this argument said dan with his ready cheerful smile let me make a proposition as i can t take both of you up to tiffany s and do the right thing what do you say to a little vaudeville i ve got the rickets how about looking at stage diamonds since we can t shake hands with the real sparklers the faithful squire tools his place close to the curb lou next a little peacocky in her bright and pretty clothes nancy on the inside slender and soberly clothed as the sparrow but with the true van alstyne fisher walk thus they set out for their evening s moderate diversion i do not suppose that many look upon a great department store as an educational institution but the one in which nancy worked was something like that to her she was surrounded by beautiful things that breathed of taste and refinement if you live in an atmosphere of luxury luxury is yours whether your money pays for it or another s the people she served were mostly women whose dress manners and position in the social world were quoted as criterions from them nancy began to take toll the best from each according to her view from one she would copy and practice a gesture from another an eloquent lifting of an eyebrow from others a manner of walking of carrying a purse of smiling of greeting a friend of addressing inferiors in station from her best beloved model mrs van alstyne fisher she made requisition for that excellent thing a soft low voice as clear as silver and as perfect in articulation as the notes of a thrush suffused in the aura of this high social refinement and good breeding it was impossible for her to escape a deeper effect of it as good habits are said to be better than good principles so perhaps good manners are better than good habits the teachings of your parents may not keep alive your new england conscience but if you sit on a straigh back chair and repeat the words prisms and pilgrims forty times the devil will flee from you and when nancy spoke in the van alstyne fisher tones she felt the thrill of noblesse oblige to her very bones there was another source of learning in the great departmental school whenever you see three or four shop girls gather in a bunch and jingle their wire bracelets as an accompaniment to apparently frivolous conversation do not think that they are there for the purpose of criticizing the way ethel does her back hair the meeting may lack the dignity of the deliberative bodies of man but it has all the importance of the occasion on which eve and her first daughter first put their heads together to make adam understand his proper place in the household it is woman s conference for common defense and exchange of strategical theories of attack and repulse upon and against the world which is a stage and man its audience who persists in throwing bouquets thereupon woman the most helpless of the young of any animal with the fawn s grace but without its fleetness with the bird s beauty but without its power of flight with the honey bee s burden of sweetness but without its oh let s drop that simile some of us may have been stung during this council of war they pass weapons one to another and exchange stratagems that each has devised and formulated out of the tactics of life i says to im says sadie ain t you the fresh thing who do you suppose i am to be addressing such a remark to me and what do you think he says back to me the heads brown black flaxen red and yellow bob together the answer is given and the parry to the thrust is decided upon to be used by each thereafter in passages at arms with the common enemy man thus nancy learned the art of defense and to women successful defense means victory the curriculum of a department store is a wide one perhaps no other college could have fitted her as well for her life s ambition the drawing of a matrimonial prize her station in the store was a favored one the music room was near enough for her to hear and become familiar with the works of the best composers at least to acquire the familiarity that passed for appreciation in the social world in which she was vaguely trying to set a tentative and aspiring foot she absorbed the educating influence of art wares of costly and dainty fabrics of adornments that are almost culture to women the other girls soon became aware of nancy s ambition here comes your millionaire nancy they would call to her whenever any man who looked the role approached her counter it got to be a habit of men who were hanging about while their women folk were shopping to stroll over to the handkerchief counter and dawdle over the cambric squares nancy s imitation high bred air and genuine dainty beauty was what attracted many men thus came to display their graces before her some of them may have been millionaires others were certainly no more than their sedulous apes nancy learned to discriminate there was a window at the end of the handkerchief counter and she could see the rows of vehicles waiting for the shoppers in the street below she looked and perceived that automobiles differ as well as do their owners once a fascinating gentleman bought four dozen handkerchiefs and wooed her across the counter with a king cophetua air when he had gone one of the girls said what s wrong nance that you didn t warm up to that fellow he looks the swell article all right to me him said nancy with her coolest sweetest most impersonal van alstyne fisher smile not for mine i saw him drive up outside a h p machine and an irish chauffeur and you saw what kind of handkerchiefs he bought silk and he s got dactylis on him give me the real thing or nothing if you please two of the most refined women in the store a forelady and a cashier had a few swell gentlemen friends with whom they now and then dined once they included nancy in an invitation the dinner took place in a spectacular cafe whose tables are engaged for new year s eve a year in advance there were two gentlemen friends one without any hair on his head high living ungrew it and we can prove it the other a young man whose worth and sophistication he impressed upon you in two convincing ways he swore that all the wine was corked and he wore diamond cuff buttons this young man perceived irresistible excellencies in nancy his taste ran to shop girls and here was one that added the voice and manners of his high social world to the franker charms of her own caste so on the following day he appeared in the store and made her a serious proposal of marriage over a box of hem stitched grass bleached irish linens nancy declined a brown pompadour ten feet away had been using her eyes and ears when the rejected suitor had gone she heaped carboys of upbraidings and horror upon nancy s head what a terrible little fool you are that fellow s a millionaire he s a nephew of old van skittles himself and he was talking on the level too have you gone crazy nance have i said nancy i didn t take him did i he isn t a millionaire so hard that you could notice it anyhow his family only allows him a year to spend the bald headed fellow was guying him about it the other night at supper the brown pompadour came nearer and narrowed her eyes say what do you want she inquired in a voice hoarse for lack of chewing gum ain t that enough for you do you want to be a mormon and marry rockefeller and gladstone dowie and the king of spain and the whole bunch ain t a year good enough for you nancy flushed a little under the level gaze of the black shallow eyes it wasn t altogether the money carrie she explained his friend caught him in a rank lie the other night at dinner it was about some girl he said he hadn t been to the theater with well i can t stand a liar put everything together i don t like him and that settles it when i sell out it s not going to be on any bargain day i ve got to have something that sits up in a chair like a man anyhow yes i m looking out for a catch but it s got to be able to do something more than make a noise like a toy bank the physiopathic ward for yours said the brown pompadour walking away these high ideas if not ideals nancy continued to cultivate on per week she bivouacked on the trail of the great unknown catch eating her dry bread and tightening her belt day by day on her face was the faint soldierly sweet grim smile of the preordained man hunter the store was her forest and many times she raised her rifle at game that seemed broad antlered and big but always some deep unerring instinct perhaps of the huntress perhaps of the woman made her hold her fire and take up the trail again lou flourished in the laundry out of her per week she paid for her room and board the rest went mainly for clothes her opportunities for bettering her taste and manners were few compared with nancy s in the steaming laundry there was nothing but work work and her thoughts of the evening pleasures to come many costly and showy fabrics passed under her iron and it may be that her growing fondness for dress was thus transmitted to her through the conducting metal when the day s work was over dan awaited her outside her faithful shadow in whatever light she stood sometimes he cast an honest and troubled glance at lou s clothes that increased in conspicuity rather than in style but this was no disloyalty he deprecated the attention they called to her in the streets and lou was no less faithful to her chum there was a law that nancy should go with them on whatsoever outings they might take dan bore the extra burden heartily and in good cheer it might be said that lou furnished the color nancy the tone and dan the weight of the distraction seeking trio the escort in his neat but obviously ready made suit his ready made tie and unfailing genial ready made wit never startled or clashed he was of that good kind that you are likely to forget while they are present but remember distinctly after they are gone to nancy s superior taste the flavor of these ready made pleasures was sometimes a little bitter but she was young and youth is a gourmand when it cannot be a gourmet dan is always wanting me to marry him right away lou told her once but why should i i m independent i can do as i please with the money i earn and he never would agree for me to keep on working afterward and say nance what do you want to stick to that old store for and half starve and half dress yourself i could get you a place in the laundry right now if you d come it seems to me that you could afford to be a little less stuck up if you could make a good deal more money i don t think i m stuck up lou said nancy but i d rather live on half rations and stay where i am i suppose i ve got the habit it s the chance that i want i don t expect to be always behind a counter i m learning something new every day i m right up against refined and rich people all the time even if i do only wait on them and i m not missing any pointers that i see passing around caught your millionaire yet asked lou with her teasing laugh i haven t selected one yet answered nancy i ve been looking them over goodness the idea of picking over em don t you ever let one get by you nance even if he s a few dollars shy but of course you re joking millionaires don t think about working girls like us it might be better for them if they did said nancy with cool wisdom some of us could teach them how to take care of their money if one was to speak to me laughed lou i know i d have a duck fit that s because you don t know any the only difference between swells and other people is you have to watch em closer don t you think that red silk lining is just a little bit too bright for that coat lou lou looked at the plain dull olive jacket of her friend well no i don t but it may seem so beside that faded looking thing you ve got on this jacket said nancy complacently has exactly the cut and fit of one that mrs van alstyne fisher was wearing the other day the material cost me i suppose hers cost about more oh well said lou lightly it don t strike me as millionaire bait shouldn t wonder if i catch one before you do anyway truly it would have taken a philosopher to decide upon the values of the theories held by the two friends lou lacking that certain pride and fastidiousness that keeps stores and desks filled with girls working for the barest living thumped away gaily with her iron in the noisy and stifling laundry her wages supported her even beyond the point of comfort so that her dress profited until sometimes she cast a sidelong glance of impatience at the neat but inelegant apparel of dan dan the constant the immutable the undeviating as for nancy her case was one of tens of thousands silk and jewels and laces and ornaments and the perfume and music of the fine world of good breeding and taste these were made for woman they are her equitable portion let her keep near them if they are a part of life to her and if she will she is no traitor to herself as esau was for she keeps he birthright and the pottage she earns is often very scant in this atmosphere nancy belonged and she throve in it and ate her frugal meals and schemed over her cheap dresses with a determined and contented mind she already knew woman and she was studying man the animal both as to his habits and eligibility some day she would bring down the game that she wanted but she promised herself it would be what seemed to her the biggest and the best and nothing smaller thus she kept her lamp trimmed and burning to receive the bridegroom when he should come but another lesson she learned perhaps unconsciously her standard of values began to shift and change sometimes the dollar mark grew blurred in her mind s eye and shaped itself into letters that spelled such words as truth and honor and now and then just kindness let us make a likeness of one who hunts the moose or elk in some mighty wood he sees a little dell mossy and embowered where a rill trickles babbling to him of rest and comfort at these times the spear of nimrod himself grows blunt so nancy wondered sometimes if persian lamb was always quoted at its market value by the hearts that it covered one thursday evening nancy left the store and turned across sixth avenue westward to the laundry she was expected to go with lou and dan to a musical comedy dan was just coming out of the laundry when she arrived there was a queer strained look on his face i thought i would drop around to see if they had heard from her he said heard from who asked nancy isn t lou there i thought you knew said dan she hasn t been here or at the house where she lived since monday she moved all her things from there she told one of the girls in the laundry she might be going to europe hasn t anybody seen her anywhere asked nancy dan looked at her with his jaws set grimly and a steely gleam in his steady gray eyes they told me in the laundry he said harshly that they saw her pass yesterday in an automobile with one of the millionaires i suppose that you and lou were forever busying your brains about for the first time nancy quailed before a man she laid her hand that trembled slightly on dan s sleeve you ve no right to say such a thing to me dan as if i had anything to do with it i didn t mean it that way said dan softening he fumbled in his vest pocket i ve got the tickets for the show to night he said with a gallant show of lightness if you nancy admired pluck whenever she saw it i ll go with you dan she said three months went by before nancy saw lou again at twilight one evening the shop girl was hurrying home along the border of a little quiet park she heard her name called and wheeled about in time to catch lou rushing into her arms after the first embrace they drew their heads back as serpents do ready to attack or to charm with a thousand questions trembling on their swift tongues and then nancy noticed that prosperity had descended upon lou manifesting itself in costly furs flashing gems and creations of the tailors art you little fool cried lou loudly and affectionately i see you are still working in that store and as shabby as ever and how about that big catch you were going to make nothing doing yet i suppose and then lou looked and saw that something better than prosperity lead descended upon nancy something that shone brighter than gems in her eyes and redder than a rose in her cheeks and that danced like electricity anxious to be loosed from the tip of her tongue yes i m still in the store said nancy but i m going to leave it next week i ve made my catch the biggest catch in the world you won t mind now lou will you i m going to be married to dan to dan he s my dan now why lou around the corner of the park strolled one of those new crop smooth faced young policemen that are making the force more endurable at least to the eye he saw a woman with an expensive fur coat and diamond ringed hands crouching down against the iron fence of the park sobbing turbulently while a slender plainly dressed working girl leaned close trying to console her but the gibsonian cop being of the new order passed on pretending not to notice for he was wise enough to know that these matters are beyond help so far as the power he represents is concerned though he rap the pavement with his nightstick till the sound goes up to the furthermost stars a madison square arabian night to carson chalmers in his apartment near the square phillips brought the evening mail beside the routine correspondence there were two items bearing the same foreign postmark one of the incoming parcels contained a photograph of a woman the other contained an interminable letter over which chalmers hung absorbed for a long time the letter was from another woman and it contained poisoned barbs sweetly dipped in honey and feathered with innuendoes concerning the photographed woman chalmers tore this letter into a thousand bits and began to wear out his expensive rug by striding back and forth upon it thus an animal from the jungle acts when it is caged and thus a caged man acts when he is housed in a jungle of doubt by and by the restless mood was overcome the rug was not an enchanted one for sixteen feet he could travel along it three thousand miles was beyond its power to aid phillips appeared he never entered he invariably appeared like a well oiled genie will you dine here sir or out he asked here said chalmers and in half an hour he listened glumly to the january blasts making an aeolian trombone of the empty street wait he said to the disappearing genie as i came home across the end of the square i saw many men standing there in rows there was one mounted upon something talking why do those men stand in rows and why are they there they are homeless men sir said phillips the man standing on the box tries to get lodging for them for the night people come around to listen and give him money then he sends as many as the money will pay for to some lodging house that is why they stand in rows they get sent to bed in order as they come by the time dinner is served said chalmers have one of those men here he will dine with me w w which began phillips stammering for the first time during his service choose one at random said chalmers you might see that he is reasonably sober and a certain amount of cleanliness will not be held against him that is all it was an unusual thing for carson chalmers to play the caliph but on that night he felt the inefficacy of conventional antidotes to melancholy something wanton and egregious something high flavored and arabian he must have to lighten his mood on the half hour phillips had finished his duties as slave of the lamp the waiters from the restaurant below had whisked aloft the delectable dinner the dining table laid for two glowed cheerily in the glow of the pink shaded candles and now phillips as though he ushered a cardinal or held in charge a burglar wafted in the shivering guest who had been haled from the line of mendicant lodgers it is a common thing to call such men wrecks if the comparison be used here it is the specific one of a derelict come to grief through fire even yet some flickering combustion illuminated the drifting hulk his face and hands had been recently washed a rite insisted upon by phillips as a memorial to the slaughtered conventions in the candle light he stood a flaw in the decorous fittings of the apartment his face was a sickly white covered almost to the eyes with a stubble the shade of a red irish setter s coat phillips s comb had failed to control the pale brown hair long matted and conformed to the contour of a constantly worn hat his eyes were full of a hopeless tricky defiance like that seen in a cur s that is cornered by his tormentors his shabby coat was buttoned high but a quarter inch of redeeming collar showed above it his manner was singularly free from embarrassment when chalmers rose from his chair across the round dining table if you will oblige me said the host i will be glad to have your company at dinner my name is plumer said the highway guest in harsh and aggressive tones if you re like me you like to know the name of the party you re dining with i was going on to say continued chalmers somewhat hastily that mine is chalmers will you sit opposite plumer of the ruffled plumes bent his knee for phillips to slide the chair beneath him he had an air of having sat at attended boards before phillips set out the anchovies and olives good barked plumer going to be in courses is it all right my jovial ruler of bagdad i m your scheherezade all the way to the toothpicks you re the first caliph with a genuine oriental flavor i ve struck since frost what luck and i was forty third in line i finished counting just as your welcome emissary arrived to bid me to the feast i had about as much chance of getting a bed to night as i have of being the next president how will you have the sad story of my life mr al raschid a chapter with each course or the whole edition with the cigars and coffee the situation does not seem a novel one to you said chalmers with a smile by the chin whiskers of the prophet no answered the guest now york s as full of cheap haroun al raschids as bagdad is of fleas i ve been held up for my story with a loaded meal pointed at my head twenty times catch anybody in new york giving you something for nothing they spell curiosity and charity with the same set of building blocks lots of em will stake you to a dime and chop suey and a few of em will play caliph to the tune of a top sirloin but every one of em will stand over you till they screw your autobiography out of you with foot notes appendix and unpublished fragments oh i know what to do when i see victuals coming toward me in little old bagdad on the subway i strike the asphalt three times with my forehead and get ready to spiel yarns for my supper i claim descent from the late tommy tucker who was forced to hand out vocal harmony for his pre digested wheaterina and spoopju i do not ask your story said chalmers i tell you frankly that it was a sudden whim that prompted me to send for some stranger to dine with me i assure you you will not suffer through any curiosity of mine oh fudge exclaimed the guest enthusiastically tackling his soup i don t mind it a bit i m a regular oriental magazine with a red cover and the leaves cut when the caliph walks abroad in fact we fellows in the bed line have a sort of union rate for things of this sort somebody s always stopping and wanting to know what brought us down so low in the world for a sandwich and a glass of beer i tell em that drink did it for corned beef and cabbage and a cup of coffee i give em the hard hearted landlord six months in the hospital lost job story a sirloin steak and a quarter for a bed gets the wall street tragedy of the swept away fortune and the gradual descent this is the first spread of this kind i ve stumbled against i haven t got a story to fit it i ll tell you what mr chalmers i m going to tell you the truth for this if you ll listen to it it ll be harder for you to believe than the made up ones an hour later the arabian guest lay back with a sigh of satisfaction while phillips brought the coffee and cigars and cleared the table did you ever hear of sherrard plumer he asked with a strange smile i remember the name said chalmers he was a painter i think of a good deal of prominence a few years ago five years said the guest then i went down like a chunk of lead i m sherrard plumer i sold the last portrait i painted for after that i couldn t have found a sitter for a gratis picture what was the trouble chalmers could not resist asking funny thing answered plumer grimly never quite understood it myself for a while i swam like a cork i broke into the swell crowd and got commissions right and left the newspapers called me a fashionable painter then the funny things began to happen whenever i finished a picture people would come to see it and whisper and look queerly at one another i soon found out what the trouble was i had a knack of bringing out in the face of a portrait the hidden character of the original i don t know how i did it i painted what i saw but i know it did me some of my sitters were fearfully enraged and refused their pictures i painted the portrait of a very beautiful and popular society dame when it was finished her husband looked at it with a peculiar expression on his face and the next week he sued for divorce i remember one case of a prominent banker who sat to me while i had his portrait on exhibition in my studio an acquaintance of his came in to look at it bless me says he does he really look like that i told him it was considered a faithful likeness i never noticed that expression about his eyes before said he i think i ll drop downtown and change my bank account he did drop down but the bank account was gone and so was mr banker it wasn t long till they put me out of business people don t want their secret meannesses shown up in a picture they can smile and twist their own faces and deceive you but the picture can t i couldn t get an order for another picture and i had to give up i worked as a newspaper artist for a while and then for a lithographer but my work with them got me into the same trouble if i drew from a photograph my drawing showed up characteristics and expressions that you couldn t find in the photo but i guess they were in the original all right the customers raised lively rows especially the women and i never could hold a job long so i began to rest my weary head upon the breast of old booze for comfort and pretty soon i was in the free bed line and doing oral fiction for hand outs among the food bazaars does the truthful statement weary thee o caliph i can turn on the wall street disaster stop if you prefer but that requires a tear and i m afraid i can t hustle one up after that good dinner no no said chalmers earnestly you interest me very much did all of your portraits reveal some unpleasant trait or were there some that did not suffer from the ordeal of your peculiar brush some yes said plumer children generally a good many women and a sufficient number of men all people aren t bad you know when they were all right the pictures were all right as i said i don t explain it but i m telling you facts on chalmers s writing table lay the photograph that he had received that day in the foreign mail ten minutes later he had plumer at work making a sketch from it in pastels at the end of an hour the artist rose and stretched wearily it s done he yawned you ll excuse me for being so long i got interested in the job lordy but i m tired no bed last night you know guess it ll have to be good night now o commander of the faithful chalmers went as far as the door with him and slipped some bills into his hand oh i ll take em said plumer all that s included in the fall thanks and for the very good dinner i shall sleep on feathers to night and dream of bagdad i hope it won t turn out to be a dream in the morning farewell most excellent caliph again chalmers paced restlessly upon his rug but his beat lay as far from the table whereon lay the pastel sketch as the room would permit twice thrice he tried to approach it but failed he could see the dun and gold and brown of the colors but there was a wall about it built by his fears that kept him at a distance he sat down and tried to calm himself he sprang up and rang for phillips there is a young artist in this building he said a mr reineman do you know which is his apartment top floor front sir said phillips go up and ask him to favor me with his presence here for a few minutes reineman came at once chalmers introduced himself mr reineman said he there is a little pastel sketch on yonder table i would be glad if you will give me your opinion of it as to its artistic merits and as a picture the young artist advanced to the table and took up the sketch chalmers half turned away leaning upon the back of a chair how do you find it he asked slowly as a drawing said the artist i can t praise it enough it s the work of a master bold and fine and true it puzzles me a little i haven t seen any pastel work near as good in years the face man the subject the original what would you say of that the face said reineman is the face of one of god s own angels may i ask who my wife shouted chalmers wheeling and pouncing upon the astonished artist gripping his hand and pounding his back she is traveling in europe take that sketch boy and paint the picture of your life from it and leave the price to me the rubaiyat of a scotch highball this document is intended to strike somewhere between a temperance lecture and the bartender s guide relative to the latter drink shall swell the theme and be set forth in abundance agreeably to the former not an elbow shall be crooked bob babbitt was off the stuff which means as you will discover by referring to the unabridged dictionary of bohemia that he had cut out the booze that he was on the water wagon the reason for bob s sudden attitude of hostility toward the demon rum as the white ribboners miscall whiskey see the bartender s guide should be of interest to reformers and saloon keepers there is always hope for a man who when sober will not concede or acknowledge that he was ever drunk but when a man will say in the apt words of the phrase distiller i had a beautiful skate on last night you will have to put stuff in his coffee as well as pray for him one evening on his way home babbitt dropped in at the broadway bar that he liked best always there were three or four fellows there from the downtown offices whom he knew and then there would be high balls and stories and he would hurry home to dinner a little late but feeling good and a little sorry for the poor standard oil company on this evening as he entered he heard some one say babbitt was in last night as full as a boiled owl babbitt walked to the bar and saw in the mirror that his face was as white as chalk for the first time he had looked truth in the eyes others had lied to him he had dissembled with himself he was a drunkard and had not known it what he had fondly imagined was a pleasant exhilaration had been maudlin intoxication his fancied wit had been drivel his gay humors nothing but the noisy vagaries of a sot but never again a glass of seltzer he said to the bartender a little silence fell upon the group of his cronies who had been expecting him to join them going off the stuff bob one of them asked politely and with more formality than the highballs ever called forth yes said babbitt some one of the group took up the unwashed thread of a story he had been telling the bartender shoved over a dime and a nickel change from the quarter ungarnished with his customary smile and babbitt walked out now babbitt had a home and a wife but that is another story and i will tell you that story which will show you a better habit and a worse story than you could find in the man who invented the phrase it began away up in sullivan county where so many rivers and so much trouble begins or begin how would you say that it was july and jessie was a summer boarder at the mountain squint hotel and bob who was just out of college saw her one day and they were married in september that s the tabloid novel one swallow of water and it s gone but those july days let the exclamation point expound it for i shall not for particulars you might read up on romeo and juliet and abraham lincoln s thrilling sonnet about you can fool some of the people c and darwin s works but one thing i must tell you about both of them were mad over omar s rubaiyat they knew every verse of the old bluffer by heart not consecutively but picking em out here and there as you fork the mushrooms in a fifty cent steak a la bordelaise sullivan county is full of rocks and trees and jessie used to sit on them and please be good used to sit on the rocks and bob had a way of standing behind her with his hands over her shoulders holding her hands and his face close to hers and they would repeat over and over their favorite verses of the old tent maker they saw only the poetry and philosophy of the lines then indeed they agreed that the wine was only an image and that what was meant to be celebrated was some divinity or maybe love or life however at that time neither of them had tasted the stuff that goes with a sixty cent table d hote where was i oh they married and came to new york bob showed his college diploma and accepted a position filling inkstands in a lawyer s office at a week at the end of two years he had worked up to and gotten his first taste of bohemia the kind that won t stand the borax and formaldehyde tests they had two furnished rooms and a little kitchen to jess accustomed to the mild but beautiful savor of a country town the dreggy bohemia was sugar and spice she hung fish seines on the walls of her rooms and bought a rakish looking sideboard and learned to play the banjo twice or thrice a week they dined at french or italian tables d hote in a cloud of smoke and brag and unshorn hair jess learned to drink a cocktail in order to get the cherry at home she smoked a cigarette after dinner she learned to pronounce chianti and leave her olive stones for the waiter to pick up once she essayed to say la la la in a crowd but got only as far as the second one they met one or two couples while dining out and became friendly with them the sideboard was stocked with scotch and rye and a liqueur they had their new friends in to dinner and all were laughing at nothing by a m some plastering fell in the room below them for which bob had to pay thus they footed it merrily on the ragged frontiers of the country that has no boundary lines or government and soon bob fell in with his cronies and learned to keep his foot on the little rail six inches above the floor for an hour or so every afternoon before he went home drink always rubbed him the right way and he would reach his rooms as jolly as a sandboy jessie would meet him at the door and generally they would dance some insane kind of a rigadoon about the floor by way of greeting once when bob s feet became confused and he tumbled headlong over a foot stool jessie laughed so heartily and long that he had to throw all the couch pillows at her to make her hush in such wise life was speeding for them on the day when bob babbitt first felt the power that the giftie gi ed him but let us get back to our lamb and mint sauce when bob got home that evening he found jessie in a long apron cutting up a lobster for the newburg usually when bob came in mellow from his hour at the bar his welcome was hilarious though somewhat tinctured with scotch smoke by screams and snatches of song and certain audible testimonials of domestic felicity was his advent proclaimed when she heard his foot on the stairs the old maid in the hall room always stuffed cotton into her ears at first jessie had shrunk from the rudeness and favor of these spiritual greetings but as the fog of the false bohemia gradually encompassed her she came to accept them as love s true and proper greeting bob came in without a word smiled kissed her neatly but noiselessly took up a paper and sat down in the hall room the old maid held her two plugs of cotton poised filled with anxiety jessie dropped lobster and knife and ran to him with frightened eyes what s the matter bob are you ill not at all dear then what s the matter with you nothing hearken brethren when she who has a right to ask interrogates you concerning a change she finds in your mood answer her thus tell her that you in a sudden rage have murdered your grandmother tell her that you have robbed orphans and that remorse has stricken you tell her your fortune is swept away that you are beset by enemies by bunions by any kind of malevolent fate but do not if peace and happiness are worth as much as a grain of mustard seed to you do not answer her nothing jessie went back to the lobster in silence she cast looks of darkest suspicion at bob he had never acted that way before when dinner was on the table she set out the bottle of scotch and the glasses bob declined tell you the truth jess he said i ve cut out the drink help yourself of course if you don t mind i ll try some of the seltzer straight you ve stopped drinking she said looking at him steadily and unsmilingly what for it wasn t doing me any good said bob don t you approve of the idea jessie raised her eyebrows and one shoulder slightly entirely she said with a sculptured smile i could not conscientiously advise any one to drink or smoke or whistle on sunday the meal was finished almost in silence bob tried to make talk but his efforts lacked the stimulus of previous evenings he felt miserable and once or twice his eye wandered toward the bottle but each time the scathing words of his bibulous friend sounded in his ear and his mouth set with determination jessie felt the change deeply the essence of their lives seemed to have departed suddenly the restless fever the false gayety the unnatural excitement of the shoddy bohemia in which they had lived had dropped away in the space of the popping of a cork she stole curious and forlorn glances at the dejected bob who bore the guilty look of at least a wife beater or a family tyrant after dinner the colored maid who came in daily to perform such chores cleared away the things jessie with an unreadable countenance brought back the bottle of scotch and the glasses and a bowl of cracked ice and set them on the table may i ask she said with some of the ice in her tones whether i am to be included in your sudden spasm of goodness if not i ll make one for myself it s rather chilly this evening for some reason oh come now jess said bob good naturedly don t be too rough on me help yourself by all means there s no danger of your overdoing it but i thought there was with me and that s why i quit have yours and then let s get out the banjo and try over that new quickstep i ve heard said jessie in the tones of the oracle that drinking alone is a pernicious habit no i don t think i feel like playing this evening if we are going to reform we may as well abandon the evil habit of banjo playing too she took up a book and sat in her little willow rocker on the other side of the table neither of them spoke for half an hour and then bob laid down his paper and got up with a strange absent look on his face and went behind her chair and reached over her shoulders taking her hands in his and laid his face close to hers in a moment to jessie the walls of the seine hung room vanished and she saw the sullivan county hills and rills bob felt her hands quiver in his as he began the verse from old omar come fill the cup and in the fire of spring the winter garment of repentance fling the bird of time has but a little way to fly and lo the bird is on the wing and then he walked to the table and poured a stiff drink of scotch into a glass but in that moment a mountain breeze had somehow found its way in and blown away the mist of the false bohemia jessie leaped and with one fierce sweep of her hand sent the bottle and glasses crashing to the floor the same motion of her arm carried it around bob s neck where it met its mate and fastened tight oh my god bobbie not that verse i see now i wasn t always such a fool was i the other one boy the one that says remould it to the heart s desire say that one to the heart s desire i know that one said bob it goes ah love could you and i with him conspire to grasp this sorry scheme of things entire would not we let me finish it said jessie would not we shatter it to bits and then remould it nearer to the heart s desire it s shattered all right said bob crunching some glass under his heel in some dungeon below the accurate ear of mrs pickens the landlady located the smash it s that wild mr babbitt coming home soused again she said and he s got such a nice little wife too the pendulum eighty first street let em out please yelled the shepherd in blue a flock of citizen sheep scrambled out and another flock scrambled aboard ding ding the cattle cars of the manhattan elevated rattled away and john perkins drifted down the stairway of the station with the released flock john walked slowly toward his flat slowly because in the lexicon of his daily life there was no such word as perhaps there are no surprises awaiting a man who has been married two years and lives in a flat as he walked john perkins prophesied to himself with gloomy and downtrodden cynicism the foregone conclusions of the monotonous day katy would meet him at the door with a kiss flavored with cold cream and butter scotch he would remove his coat sit upon a macadamized lounge and read in the evening paper of russians and japs slaughtered by the deadly linotype for dinner there would be pot roast a salad flavored with a dressing warranted not to crack or injure the leather stewed rhubarb and the bottle of strawberry marmalade blushing at the certificate of chemical purity on its label after dinner katy would show him the new patch in her crazy quilt that the iceman had cut for her off the end of his four in hand at half past seven they would spread newspapers over the furniture to catch the pieces of plastering that fell when the fat man in the flat overhead began to take his physical culture exercises exactly at eight hickey mooney of the vaudeville team unbooked in the flat across the hall would yield to the gentle influence of delirium tremens and begin to overturn chairs under the delusion that hammerstein was pursuing them with a five hundred dollar a week contract then the gent at the window across the air shaft would get out his flute the nightly gas leak would steal forth to frolic in the highways the dumbwaiter would slip off its trolley the janitor would drive mrs zanowitski s five children once more across the yalu the lady with the champagne shoes and the skye terrier would trip downstairs and paste her thursday name over her bell and letter box and the evening routine of the frogmore flats would be under way john perkins knew these things would happen and he knew that at a quarter past eight he would summon his nerve and reach for his hat and that his wife would deliver this speech in a querulous tone now where are you going i d like to know john perkins thought i d drop up to mccloskey s he would answer and play a game or two of pool with the fellows of late such had been john perkins s habit at ten or eleven he would return sometimes katy would be asleep sometimes waiting up ready to melt in the crucible of her ire a little more gold plating from the wrought steel chains of matrimony for these things cupid will have to answer when he stands at the bar of justice with his victims from the frogmore flats to night john perkins encountered a tremendous upheaval of the commonplace when he reached his door no katy was there with her affectionate confectionate kiss the three rooms seemed in portentous disorder all about lay her things in confusion shoes in the middle of the floor curling tongs hair bows kimonos powder box jumbled together on dresser and chairs this was not katy s way with a sinking heart john saw the comb with a curling cloud of her brown hair among its teeth some unusual hurry and perturbation must have possessed her for she always carefully placed these combings in the little blue vase on the mantel to be some day formed into the coveted feminine rat hanging conspicuously to the gas jet by a string was a folded paper john seized it it was a note from his wife running thus dear john i just had a telegram saying mother is very sick i am going to take the train brother sam is going to meet me at the depot there there is cold mutton in the ice box i hope it isn t her quinzy again pay the milkman cents she had it bad last spring don t forget to write to the company about the gas meter and your good socks are in the top drawer i will write to morrow hastily katy never during their two years of matrimony had he and katy been separated for a night john read the note over and over in a dumbfounded way here was a break in a routine that had never varied and it left him dazed there on the back of a chair hung pathetically empty and formless the red wrapper with black dots that she always wore while getting the meals her week day clothes had been tossed here and there in her haste a little paper bag of her favorite butterscotch lay with its string yet unwound a daily paper sprawled on the floor gaping rectangularly where a railroad time table had been clipped from it everything in the room spoke of a loss of an essence gone of its soul and life departed john perkins stood among the dead remains with a queer feeling of desolation in his heart he began to set the rooms tidy as well as he could when he touched her clothes a thrill of something like terror went through him he had never thought what existence would be without katy she had become so thoroughly annealed into his life that she was like the air he breathed necessary but scarcely noticed now without warning she was gone vanished as completely absent as if she had never existed of course it would be only for a few days or at most a week or two but it seemed to him as if the very hand of death had pointed a finger at his secure and uneventful home john dragged the cold mutton from the ice box made coffee and sat down to a lonely meal face to face with the strawberry marmalade s shameless certificate of purity bright among withdrawn blessings now appeared to him the ghosts of pot roasts and the salad with tan polish dressing his home was dismantled a quinzied mother in law had knocked his lares and penates sky high after his solitary meal john sat at a front window he did not care to smoke outside the city roared to him to come join in its dance of folly and pleasure the night was his he might go forth unquestioned and thrum the strings of jollity as free as any gay bachelor there he might carouse and wander and have his fling until dawn if he liked and there would be no wrathful katy waiting for him bearing the chalice that held the dregs of his joy he might play pool at mccloskey s with his roistering friends until aurora dimmed the electric bulbs if he chose the hymeneal strings that had curbed him always when the frogmore flats had palled upon him were loosened katy was gone john perkins was not accustomed to analyzing his emotions but as he sat in his katy bereft x parlor he hit unerringly upon the keynote of his discomfort he knew now that katy was necessary to his happiness his feeling for her lulled into unconsciousness by the dull round of domesticity had been sharply stirred by the loss of her presence has it not been dinned into us by proverb and sermon and fable that we never prize the music till the sweet voiced bird has flown or in other no less florid and true utterances i m a double dyed dub mused john perkins the way i ve been treating katy off every night playing pool and bumming with the boys instead of staying home with her the poor girl here all alone with nothing to amuse her and me acting that way john perkins you re the worst kind of a shine i m going to make it up for the little girl i ll take her out and let her see some amusement and i ll cut out the mccloskey gang right from this minute yes there was the city roaring outside for john perkins to come dance in the train of momus and at mccloskey s the boys were knocking the balls idly into the pockets against the hour for the nightly game but no primrose way nor clicking cue could woo the remorseful soul of perkins the bereft the thing that was his lightly held and half scorned had been taken away from him and he wanted it backward to a certain man named adam whom the cherubim bounced from the orchard could perkins the remorseful trace his descent near the right hand of john perkins stood a chair on the back of it stood katy s blue shirtwaist it still retained something of her contour midway of the sleeves were fine individual wrinkles made by the movements of her arms in working for his comfort and pleasure a delicate but impelling odor of bluebells came from it john took it and looked long and soberly at the unresponsive grenadine katy had never been unresponsive tears yes tears came into john perkins s eyes when she came back things would be different he would make up for all his neglect what was life without her the door opened katy walked in carrying a little hand satchel john stared at her stupidly my i m glad to get back said katy ma wasn t sick to amount to anything sam was at the depot and said she just had a little spell and got all right soon after they telegraphed so i took the next train back i m just dying for a cup of coffee nobody heard the click and rattle of the cog wheels as the third floor front of the frogmore flats buzzed its machinery back into the order of things a band slipped a spring was touched the gear was adjusted and the wheels revolve in their old orbit john perkins looked at the clock it was he reached for his hat and walked to the door now where are you going i d like to know john perkins asked katy in a querulous tone thought i d drop up to mccloskey s said john and play a game or two of pool with the fellows two thanksgiving day gentlemen there is one day that is ours there is one day when all we americans who are not self made go back to the old home to eat saleratus biscuits and marvel how much nearer to the porch the old pump looks than it used to bless the day president roosevelt gives it to us we hear some talk of the puritans but don t just remember who they were bet we can lick em anyhow if they try to land again plymouth rocks well that sounds more familiar lots of us have had to come down to hens since the turkey trust got its work in but somebody in washington is leaking out advance information to em about these thanksgiving proclamations the big city east of the cranberry bogs has made thanksgiving day an institution the last thursday in november is the only day in the year on which it recognizes the part of america lying across the ferries it is the one day that is purely american yes a day of celebration exclusively american and now for the story which is to prove to you that we have traditions on this side of the ocean that are becoming older at a much rapider rate than those of england are thanks to our git up and enterprise stuffy pete took his seat on the third bench to the right as you enter union square from the east at the walk opposite the fountain every thanksgiving day for nine years he had taken his seat there promptly at o clock for every time he had done so things had happened to him charles dickensy things that swelled his waistcoat above his heart and equally on the other side but to day stuffy pete s appearance at the annual trysting place seemed to have been rather the result of habit than of the yearly hunger which as the philanthropists seem to think afflicts the poor at such extended intervals certainly pete was not hungry he had just come from a feast that had left him of his powers barely those of respiration and locomotion his eyes were like two pale gooseberries firmly imbedded in a swollen and gravy smeared mask of putty his breath came in short wheezes a senatorial roll of adipose tissue denied a fashionable set to his upturned coat collar buttons that had been sewed upon his clothes by kind salvation fingers a week before flew like popcorn strewing the earth around him ragged he was with a split shirt front open to the wishbone but the november breeze carrying fine snowflakes brought him only a grateful coolness for stuffy pete was overcharged with the caloric produced by a superbountiful dinner beginning with oysters and ending with plum pudding and including it seemed to him all the roast turkey and baked potatoes and chicken salad and squash pie and ice cream in the world wherefore he sat gorged and gazed upon the world with after dinner contempt the meal had been an unexpected one he was passing a red brick mansion near the beginning of fifth avenue in which lived two old ladies of ancient family and a reverence for traditions they even denied the existence of new york and believed that thanksgiving day was declared solely for washington square one of their traditional habits was to station a servant at the postern gate with orders to admit the first hungry wayfarer that came along after the hour of noon had struck and banquet him to a finish stuffy pete happened to pass by on his way to the park and the seneschals gathered him in and upheld the custom of the castle after stuffy pete had gazed straight before him for ten minutes he was conscious of a desire for a more varied field of vision with a tremendous effort he moved his head slowly to the left and then his eyes bulged out fearfully and his breath ceased and the rough shod ends of his short legs wriggled and rustled on the gravel for the old gentleman was coming across fourth avenue toward his bench every thanksgiving day for nine years the old gentleman had come there and found stuffy pete on his bench that was a thing that the old gentleman was trying to make a tradition of every thanksgiving day for nine years he had found stuffy there and had led him to a restaurant and watched him eat a big dinner they do those things in england unconsciously but this is a young country and nine years is not so bad the old gentleman was a staunch american patriot and considered himself a pioneer in american tradition in order to become picturesque we must keep on doing one thing for a long time without ever letting it get away from us something like collecting the weekly dimes in industrial insurance or cleaning the streets the old gentleman moved straight and stately toward the institution that he was rearing truly the annual feeling of stuffy pete was nothing national in its character such as the magna charta or jam for breakfast was in england but it was a step it was almost feudal it showed at least that a custom was not impossible to new y ahem america the old gentleman was thin and tall and sixty he was dressed all in black and wore the old fashioned kind of glasses that won t stay on your nose his hair was whiter and thinner than it had been last year and he seemed to make more use of his big knobby cane with the crooked handle as his established benefactor came up stuffy wheezed and shuddered like some woman s over fat pug when a street dog bristles up at him he would have flown but all the skill of santos dumont could not have separated him from his bench well had the myrmidons of the two old ladies done their work good morning said the old gentleman i am glad to perceive that the vicissitudes of another year have spared you to move in health about the beautiful world for that blessing alone this day of thanksgiving is well proclaimed to each of us if you will come with me my man i will provide you with a dinner that should make your physical being accord with the mental that is what the old gentleman said every time every thanksgiving day for nine years the words themselves almost formed an institution nothing could be compared with them except the declaration of independence always before they had been music in stuffy s ears but now he looked up at the old gentleman s face with tearful agony in his own the fine snow almost sizzled when it fell upon his perspiring brow but the old gentleman shivered a little and turned his back to the wind stuffy had always wondered why the old gentleman spoke his speech rather sadly he did not know that it was because he was wishing every time that he had a son to succeed him a son who would come there after he was gone a son who would stand proud and strong before some subsequent stuffy and say in memory of my father then it would be an institution but the old gentleman had no relatives he lived in rented rooms in one of the decayed old family brownstone mansions in one of the quiet streets east of the park in the winter he raised fuchsias in a little conservatory the size of a steamer trunk in the spring he walked in the easter parade in the summer he lived at a farmhouse in the new jersey hills and sat in a wicker armchair speaking of a butterfly the ornithoptera amphrisius that he hoped to find some day in the autumn he fed stuffy a dinner these were the old gentleman s occupations stuffy pete looked up at him for a half minute stewing and helpless in his own self pity the old gentleman s eyes were bright with the giving pleasure his face was getting more lined each year but his little black necktie was in as jaunty a bow as ever and the linen was beautiful and white and his gray mustache was curled carefully at the ends and then stuffy made a noise that sounded like peas bubbling in a pot speech was intended and as the old gentleman had heard the sounds nine times before he rightly construed them into stuffy s old formula of acceptance thankee sir i ll go with ye and much obliged i m very hungry sir the coma of repletion had not prevented from entering stuffy s mind the conviction that he was the basis of an institution his thanksgiving appetite was not his own it belonged by all the sacred rights of established custom if not by the actual statute of limitations to this kind old gentleman who bad preempted it true america is free but in order to establish tradition some one must be a repetend a repeating decimal the heroes are not all heroes of steel and gold see one here that wielded only weapons of iron badly silvered and tin the old gentleman led his annual protege southward to the restaurant and to the table where the feast had always occurred they were recognized here comes de old guy said a waiter dat blows dat same bum to a meal every thanksgiving the old gentleman sat across the table glowing like a smoked pearl at his corner stone of future ancient tradition the waiters heaped the table with holiday food and stuffy with a sigh that was mistaken for hunger s expression raised knife and fork and carved for himself a crown of imperishable bay no more valiant hero ever fought his way through the ranks of an enemy turkey chops soups vegetables pies disappeared before him as fast as they could be served gorged nearly to the uttermost when he entered the restaurant the smell of food had almost caused him to lose his honor as a gentleman but he rallied like a true knight he saw the look of beneficent happiness on the old gentleman s face a happier look than even the fuchsias and the ornithoptera aniphrisins had ever brought to it and he had not the heart to see it wane in an hour stuffy leaned back with a battle won thankee kindly sir he puffed like a leaky steam pipe thankee kindly for a hearty meal then he arose heavily with glazed eyes and started toward the kitchen a waiter turned him about like a top and pointed him toward the door the old gentleman carefully counted out in silver change leaving three nickels for the waiter they parted as they did each year at the door the old gentleman going south stuffy north around the first corner stuffy turned and stood for one minute then he seemed to puff out his rags as an owl puffs out his feathers and fell to the sidewalk like a sunstricken horse when the ambulance came the young surgeon and the driver cursed softly at his weight there was no smell of whiskey to justify a transfer to the patrol wagon so stuffy and his two dinners went to the hospital there they stretched him on a bed and began to test him for strange diseases with the hope of getting a chance at some problem with the bare steel and lo an hour later another ambulance brought the old gentleman and they laid him on another bed and spoke of appendicitis for he looked good for the bill but pretty soon one of the young doctors met one of the young nurses whose eyes he liked and stopped to chat with her about the cases that nice old gentleman over there now he said you wouldn t think that was a case of almost starvation proud old family i guess he told me he hadn t eaten a thing for three days the assessor of success hastings beauchamp morley sauntered across union square with a pitying look at the hundreds that lolled upon the park benches they were a motley lot he thought the men with stolid animal unshaven faces the women wriggling and self conscious twining and untwining their feet that hung four inches above the gravelled walks were i mr carnegie or mr rockefeller i would put a few millions in my inside pocket and make an appointment with all the park commissioners around the corner if necessary and arrange for benches in all the parks of the world low enough for women to sit upon and rest their feet upon the ground after that i might furnish libraries to towns that would pay for em or build sanitariums for crank professors and call em colleges if i wanted to women s rights societies have been laboring for many years after equality with man with what result when they sit on a bench they must twist their ankles together and uncomfortably swing their highest french heels clear of earthly support begin at the bottom ladies get your feet on the ground and then rise to theories of mental equality hastings beauchamp morley was carefully and neatly dressed that was the result of an instinct due to his birth and breeding it is denied us to look further into a man s bosom than the starch on his shirt front so it is left to us only to recount his walks and conversation morley had not a cent in his pockets but he smiled pityingly at a hundred grimy unfortunate ones who had no more and who would have no more when the sun s first rays yellowed the tall paper cutter building on the west side of the square but morley would have enough by then sundown had seen his pockets empty before but sunrise had always seen them lined first he went to the house of a clergyman off madison avenue and presented a forged letter of introduction that holily purported to issue from a pastorate in indiana this netted him when backed up by a realistic romance of a delayed remittance on the sidewalk twenty steps from the clergyman s door a pale faced fat man huskily enveloped him with a raised red fist and the voice of a bell buoy demanding payment of an old score why bergman man sang morley dulcetly is this you i was just on my way up to your place to settle up that remittance from my aunt arrived only this morning wrong address was the trouble come up to the corner and i ll square up glad to see you saves me a walk four drinks placated the emotional bergman there was an air about morley when he was backed by money in hand that would have stayed off a call loan at rothschilds when he was penniless his bluff was pitched half a tone lower but few are competent to detect the difference in the notes you gum to mine blace and bay me to morrow mr morley said bergman oxcuse me dat i dun you on der street but i haf not seen you in dree mont pros t morley walked away with a crooked smile on his pale smooth face the credulous drink softened german amused him he would have to avoid twenty ninth street in the future he had not been aware that bergman ever went home by that route at the door of a darkened house two squares to the north morley knocked with a peculiar sequence of raps the door opened to the length of a six inch chain and the pompous important black face of an african guardian imposed itself in the opening morley was admitted in a third story room in an atmosphere opaque with smoke he hung for ten minutes above a roulette wheel then downstairs he crept and was out sped by the important negro jingling in his pocket the cents in silver that remained to him of his five dollar capital at the corner lie lingered undecided across the street was a drug store well lighted sending forth gleams from the german silver and crystal of its soda fountain and glasses along came a youngster of five headed for the dispensary stepping high with the consequence of a big errand possibly one to which his advancing age had earned him promotion in his hand he clutched something tightly publicly proudly conspicuously morley stopped him with his winning smile and soft speech me said the youngster i m doin to the drug tore for mamma she dave me a dollar to buy a bottle of med cin now now now said morley such a big man you are to be doing errands for mamma i must go along with my little man to see that the cars don t run over him and on the way we ll have some chocolates or would he rather have lemon drops morley entered the drug store leading the child by the hand he presented the prescription that had been wrapped around the money on his face was a smile predatory parental politic profound aqua pura one pint said he to the druggist sodium chloride ten grains fiat solution and don t try to skin me because i know all about the number of gallons of h o in the croton reservoir and i always use the other ingredient on my potatoes fifteen cents said the druggist with a wink after he had compounded the order i see you understand pharmacy a dollar is the regular price to gulls said morley smilingly he settled the wrapped bottle carefully in the child s arms and escorted him to the corner in his own pocket he dropped the cents accruing to him by virtue of his chemical knowledge look out for the cars sonny he said cheerfully to his small victim two street cars suddenly swooped in opposite directions upon the youngster morley dashed between them and pinned the infantile messenger by the neck holding him in safety then from the corner of his street he sent him on his way swindled happy and sticky with vile cheap candy from the italian s fruit stand morley went to a restaurant and ordered a sirloin and a pint of inexpensive chateau breuille he laughed noiselessly but so genuinely that the waiter ventured to premise that good news had come his way why no said morley who seldom held conversation with any one it is not that it is something else that amuses me do you know what three divisions of people are easiest to over reach in transactions of all kinds sure said the waiter calculating the size of the tip promised by the careful knot of morley s tie there s the buyers from the dry goods stores in the south during august and honeymooners from staten island and wrong said morley chuckling happily the answer is just men women and children the world well say new york and as far as summer boarders can swim out from long island is full of greenhorns two minutes longer on the broiler would have made this steak fit to be eaten by a gentleman francois if yez t inks it s on de bum said the waiter oi ll morley lifted his hand in protest slightly martyred protest it will do he said magnanimously and now green chartreuse frappe and a demi tasse morley went out leisurely and stood on a corner where two tradeful arteries of the city cross with a solitary dime in his pocket he stood on the curb watching with confident cynical smiling eyes the tides of people that flowed past him into that stream he must cast his net and draw fish for his further sustenance and need good izaak walton had not the half of his self reliance and bait lore a joyful party of four two women and two men fell upon him with cries of delight there was a dinner party on where had he been for a fortnight past what luck to thus run upon him they surrounded and engulfed him he must join them tra la la and the rest one with a white hat plume curving to the shoulder touched his sleeve and cast at the others a triumphant look that said see what i can do with him and added her queen s command to the invitations i leave you to imagine said morley pathetically how it desolates me to forego the pleasure but my friend carruthers of the new york yacht club is to pick me up here in his motor car at the white plume tossed and the quartet danced like midges around an arc light down the frolicsome way morley stood turning over and over the dime in his pocket and laughing gleefully to himself front he chanted under his breath front does it it is trumps in the game how they take it in men women and children forgeries water and salt lies how they all take it in an old man with an ill fitting suit a straggling gray beard and a corpulent umbrella hopped from the conglomeration of cabs and street cars to the sidewalk at morley s side stranger said he excuse me for troubling you but do you know anybody in this here town named solomon smothers he s my son and i ve come down from ellenville to visit him be darned if i know what i done with his street and number i do not sir said morley half closing his eyes to veil the joy in them you had better apply to the police the police said the old man i ain t done nothin to call in the police about i just come down to see ben he lives in a five story house he writes me if you know anybody by that name and could i told you i did not said morley coldly i know no one by the name of smithers and i advise you to smothers not smithers interrupted the old man hopefully a heavy sot man sandy complected about twenty nine two front teeth out about five foot oh smothers exclaimed morley sol smothers why he lives in the next house to me i thought you said smithers morley looked at his watch you must have a watch you can do it for a dollar better go hungry than forego a gunmetal or the ninety eight cent one that the railroads according to these watchmakers are run by the bishop of long island said morley was to meet me here at to dine with me at the kingfishers club but i can t leave the father of my friend sol smothers alone on the street by st swithin mr smothers we wall street men have to work tired is no name for it i was about to step across to the other corner and have a glass of ginger ale with a dash of sherry when you approached me you must let me take you to sol s house mr smothers but before we take the car i hope you will join me in an hour later morley seated himself on the end of a quiet bench in madison square with a twenty five cent cigar between his lips and in deeply creased bills in his inside pocket content light hearted ironical keenly philosophic he watched the moon drifting in and out amidst a maze of flying clouds an old ragged man with a low bowed head sat at the other end of the bench presently the old man stirred and looked at his bench companion in morley s appearance he seemed to recognize something superior to the usual nightly occupants of the benches kind sir he whined if you could spare a dime or even a few pennies to one who morley cut short his stereotyped appeal by throwing him a dollar god bless you said the old man i ve been trying to find work for work echoed morley with his ringing laugh you are a fool my friend the world is a rock to you no doubt but you must be an aaron and smite it with your rod then things better than water will gush out of it for you that is what the world is for it gives to me whatever i want from it god has blessed you said the old man it is only work that i have known and now i can get no more i must go home said morley rising and buttoning his coat i stopped here only for a smoke i hope you may find work may your kindness be rewarded this night said the old man oh said morley you have your wish already i am satisfied i think good luck follows me like a dog i am for yonder bright hotel across the square for the night and what a moon that is lighting up the city to night i think no one enjoys the moonlight and such little things as i do well a goodnight to you morley walked to the corner where he would cross to his hotel he blew slow streams of smoke from his cigar heavenward a policeman passing saluted to his benign nod what a fine moon it was the clock struck nine as a girl just entering womanhood stopped on the corner waiting for the approaching car she was hurrying as if homeward from employment or delay her eyes were clear and pure she was dressed in simple white she looked eagerly for the car and neither to the right nor the left morley knew her eight years before he had sat on the same bench with her at school there had been no sentiment between them nothing but the friendship of innocent days but he turned down the side street to a quiet spot and laid his suddenly burning face against the cool iron of a lamp post and said dully god i wish i could die the buyer from cactus city it is well that hay fever and colds do not obtain in the healthful vicinity of cactus city texas for the dry goods emporium of navarro platt situated there is not to be sneezed at twenty thousand people in cactus city scatter their silver coin with liberal hands for the things that their hearts desire the bulk of this semiprecious metal goes to navarro platt their huge brick building covers enough ground to graze a dozen head of sheep you can buy of them a rattlesnake skin necktie an automobile or an eighty five dollar latest style ladies tan coat in twenty different shades navarro platt first introduced pennies west of the colorado river they had been ranchmen with business heads who saw that the world did not necessarily have to cease its revolutions after free grass went out every spring navarro senior partner fifty five half spanish cosmopolitan able polished had gone on to new york to buy goods this year he shied at taking up the long trail he was undoubtedly growing older and he looked at his watch several times a day before the hour came for his siesta john he said to his junior partner you shall go on this year to buy the goods platt looked tired i m told said he that new york is a plumb dead town but i ll go i can take a whirl in san antone for a few days on my way and have some fun two weeks later a man in a texas full dress suit black frock coat broad brimmed soft white hat and lay down collar inch high with black wrought iron necktie entered tile wholesale cloak and suit establishment of zizzbaum son on lower broadway old zizzbaum had the eye of an osprey the memory of an elephant and a mind that unfolded from him in three movements like the puzzle of the carpenter s rule he rolled to the front like a brunette polar bear and shook platt s hand and how is the good mr navarro in texas he said the trip was too long for him this year so we welcome mr platt instead a bull s eye said platt and i d give forty acres of unirrigated pecos county land to know how you did it i knew grinned zizzbaum just as i know that the rainfall in el paso for the year was inches or an increase of inches and that therefore navarro platt will buy a stock of suits this spring instead of as in a dry year but that will be tomorrow there is first a cigar in my private office that will remove from your mouth the taste of the ones you smuggle across the rio grande and like because they are smuggled it was late in the afternoon and business for the day had ended zizzbaum left platt with a half smoked cigar and came out of the private office to son who was arranging his diamond scarfpin before a mirror ready to leave abey lie said you will have to take mr platt around to night and show him things they are customers for ten years mr navarro and i we played chess every moment of spare time when he came that is good but mr platt is a young man and this is his first visit to new york he should amuse easily all right said abey screwing the guard tightly on his pin i ll take him on after he s seen the flatiron and the head waiter at the hotel astor and heard the phonograph play under the old apple tree it ll be half past ten and mr texas will be ready to roll up in his blanket i ve got a supper engagement at but he ll be all to the mrs winslow before then the next morning at platt walked into the store ready to do business he had a bunch of hyacinths pinned on his lapel zizzbaum himself waited on him navarro platt were good customers and never failed to take their discount for cash and what did you think of our little town asked zizzbaum with the fatuous smile of the manhattanite i shouldn t care to live in it said the texan your son and i knocked around quite a little last night you ve got good water but cactus city is better lit up we ve got a few lights on broadway don t you think mr platt and a good many shadows said platt i think i like your horses best i haven t seen a crowbait since i ve been in town zizzbaum led him up stairs to show the samples of suits ask miss asher to come he said to a clerk miss asher came and platt of navarro platt felt for the first time the wonderful bright light of romance and glory descend upon him he stood still as a granite cliff above the canon of the colorado with his wide open eyes fixed upon her she noticed his look and flushed a little which was contrary to her custom miss asher was the crack model of zizzbaum son she was of the blond type known as medium and her measurements even went the required standard a little better she had been at zizzbaum s two years and knew her business her eye was bright but cool and had she chosen to match her gaze against the optic of the famed basilisk that fabulous monster s gaze would have wavered and softened first incidentally she knew buyers now mr platt said zizzbaum i want you to see these princess gowns in the light shades they will be the thing in your climate this first if you please miss asher swiftly in and out of the dressing room the prize model flew each time wearing a new costume and looking more stunning with every change she posed with absolute self possession before the stricken buyer who stood tongue tied and motionless while zizzbaum orated oilily of the styles on the model s face was her faint impersonal professional smile that seemed to cover something like weariness or contempt when the display was over platt seemed to hesitate zizzbaum was a little anxious thinking that his customer might be inclined to try elsewhere but platt was only looking over in his mind the best building sites in cactus city trying to select one on which to build a house for his wife to be who was just then in the dressing room taking off an evening gown of lavender and tulle take your time mr platt said zizzbaum think it over to night you won t find anybody else meet our prices on goods like these i m afraid you re having a dull time in new york mr platt a young man like you of course you miss the society of the ladies wouldn t you like a nice young lady to take out to dinner this evening miss asher now is a very nice young lady she will make it agreeable for you why she doesn t know me said platt wonderingly she doesn t know anything about me would she go i m not acquainted with her would she go repeated zizzbaum with uplifted eyebrows sure she would go i will introduce you sure she would go he called miss asher loudly she came calm and slightly contemptuous in her white shirt waist and plain black skirt mr platt would like the pleasure of your company to dinner this evening said zizzbaum walking away sure said miss asher looking at the ceiling i d be much pleased nine eleven west twentieth street what time say seven o clock all right but please don t come ahead of time i room with a school teacher and she doesn t allow any gentlemen to call in the room there isn t any parlor so you ll have to wait in the hall i ll be ready at half past seven platt and miss asher sat at a table in a broadway restaurant she was dressed in a plain filmy black platt didn t know that it was all a part of her day s work with the unobtrusive aid of a good waiter he managed to order a respectable dinner minus the usual broadway preliminaries miss asher flashed upon him a dazzling smile mayn t i have something to drink she asked why certainly said platt anything you want a dry martini she said to the waiter when it was brought and set before her platt reached over and took it away what is this he asked a cocktail of course i thought it was some kind of tea you ordered this is liquor you can t drink this what is your first name to my intimate friends said miss asher freezingly it is helen listen helen said platt leaning over the table for many years every time the spring flowers blossomed out on the prairies i got to thinking of somebody that i d never seen or heard of i knew it was you the minute i saw you yesterday i m going back home to morrow and you re going with me i know it for i saw it in your eyes when you first looked at me you needn t kick for you ve got to fall into line here s a little trick i picked out for you on my way over he flicked a two carat diamond solitaire ring across the table miss asher flipped it back to him with her fork don t get fresh she said severely i m worth a hundred thousand dollars said platt i ll build you the finest house in west texas you can t buy me mr buyer said miss asher if you had a hundred million i didn t think i d have to call you down you didn t look like the others to me at first but i see you re all alike all who asked platt all you buyers you think because we girls have to go out to dinner with you or lose our jobs that you re privileged to say what you please well forget it i thought you were different from the others but i see i was mistaken platt struck his fingers on the table with a gesture of sudden illuminating satisfaction i ve got it he exclaimed almost hilariously the nicholson place over on the north side there s a big grove of live oaks and a natural lake the old house can be pulled down and the new one set further back put out your pipe said miss asher i m sorry to wake you up but you fellows might as well get wise once for all to where you stand i m supposed to go to dinner with you and help jolly you along so you ll trade with old zizzy but don t expect to find me in any of the suits you buy do you mean to tell me said platt that you go out this way with customers and they all they all talk to you like i have they all make plays said miss asher but i must say that you ve got em beat in one respect they generally talk diamonds while you ve actually dug one up how long have you been working helen got my name pat haven t you i ve been supporting myself for eight years i was a cash girl and a wrapper and then a shop girl until i was grown and then i got to be a suit model mr texas man don t you think a little wine would make this dinner a little less dry you re not going to drink wine any more dear it s awful to think how i ll come to the store to morrow and get you i want you to pick out an automobile before we leave that s all we need to buy here oh cut that out if you knew how sick i am of hearing such talk after the dinner they walked down broadway and came upon diana s little wooded park the trees caught platt s eye at once and he must turn along under the winding walk beneath them the lights shone upon two bright tears in the model s eyes i don t like that said platt what s the matter don t you mind said miss asher well it s because well i didn t think you were that kind when i first saw you but you are all like and now will you take me home or will i have to call a cop platt took her to the door of her boarding house they stood for a minute in the vestibule she looked at him with such scorn in her eyes that even his heart of oak began to waver his arm was half way around her waist when she struck him a stinging blow on the face with her open hand as he stepped back a ring fell from somewhere and bounded on the tiled floor platt groped for it and found it now take your useless diamond and go mr buyer she said this was the other one the wedding ring said the texan holding the smooth gold band on the palm of his hand miss asher s eyes blazed upon him in the half darkness was that what you meant did you somebody opened the door from inside the house good night said platt i ll see you at the store to morrow miss asher ran up to her room and shook the school teacher until she sat up in bed ready to scream fire where is it she cried that s what i want to know said the model you ve studied geography emma and you ought to know where is a town called cac cac carac caracas city i think they called it how dare you wake me up for that said the school teacher caracas is in venezuela of course what s it like why it s principally earthquakes and negroes and monkeys and malarial fever and volcanoes i don t care said miss asher blithely i m going there to morrow the badge of policeman o roon it cannot be denied that men and women have looked upon one another for the first time and become instantly enamored it is a risky process this love at first sight before she has seen him in bradstreet or he has seen her in curl papers but these things do happen and one instance must form a theme for this story though not thank heaven to the overshadowing of more vital and important subjects such as drink policemen horses and earldoms during a certain war a troop calling itself the gentle riders rode into history and one or two ambuscades the gentle riders were recruited from the aristocracy of the wild men of the west and the wild men of the aristocracy of the east in khaki there is little telling them one from another so they became good friends and comrades all around ellsworth remsen whose old knickerbocker descent atoned for his modest rating at only ten millions ate his canned beef gayly by the campfires of the gentle riders the war was a great lark to him so that he scarcely regretted polo and planked shad one of the troopers was a well set up affable cool young man who called himself o roon to this young man remsen took an especial liking the two rode side by side during the famous mooted up hill charge that was disputed so hotly at the time by the spaniards and afterward by the democrats after the war remsen came back to his polo and shad one day a well set up affable cool young man disturbed him at his club and he and o roon were soon pounding each other and exchanging opprobrious epithets after the manner of long lost friends o roon looked seedy and out of luck and perfectly contented but it seemed that his content was only apparent get me a job remsen he said i ve just handed a barber my last shilling no trouble at all said remsen i know a lot of men who have banks and stores and things downtown any particular line you fancy yes said o roon with a look of interest i took a walk in your central park this morning i d like to be one of those bobbies on horseback that would be about the ticket besides it s the only thing i could do i can ride a little and the fresh air suits me think you could land that for me remsen was sure that he could and in a very short time he did and they who were not above looking at mounted policemen might have seen a well set up affable cool young man on a prancing chestnut steed attending to his duties along the driveways of the park and now at the extreme risk of wearying old gentlemen who carry leather fob chains and elderly ladies who but no grandmother herself yet thrills at foolish immortal romeo there must be a hint of love at first sight it came just as remsen was strolling into fifth avenue from his club a few doors away a motor car was creeping along foot by foot impeded by a freshet of vehicles that filled the street in the car was a chauffeur and an old gentleman with snowy side whiskers and a scotch plaid cap which could not be worn while automobiling except by a personage not even a wine agent would dare do it but these two were of no consequence except perhaps for the guiding of the machine and the paying for it at the old gentleman s side sat a young lady more beautiful than pomegranate blossoms more exquisite than the first quarter moon viewed at twilight through the tops of oleanders remsen saw her and knew his fate he could have flunk himself under the very wheels that conveyed her but he knew that would be the last means of attracting the attention of those who ride in motor cars slowly the auto passed and if we place the poets above the autoists carried the heart of remsen with it here was a large city of millions and many women who at a certain distance appear to resemble pomegranate blossoms yet he hoped to see her again for each one fancies that his romance has its own tutelary guardian and divinity luckily for remsen s peace of mind there came a diversion in the guise of a reunion of the gentle riders of the city there were not many of them perhaps a score and there was wassail and things to eat and speeches and the spaniard was bearded again in recapitulation and when daylight threatened them the survivors prepared to depart but some remained upon the battlefield one of these was trooper o roon who was not seasoned to potent liquids his legs declined to fulfil the obligations they had sworn to the police department i m stewed remsen said o roon to his friend why do they build hotels that go round and round like catherine wheels they ll take away my shield and break me i can think and talk con con consec sec secutively but i s s stammer with my feet i ve got to go on duty in three hours the jig is up remsen the jig is up i tell you look at me said remsen who was his smiling self pointing to his own face whom do you see here goo fellow said o roon dizzily goo old remsen not so said remsen you see mounted policeman o roon look at your face no you can t do that without a glass but look at mine and think of yours how much alike are we as two french table d hote dinners with your badge on your horse in your uniform will i charm nurse maids and prevent the grass from growing under people s feet in the park this day i will have your badge and your honor besides having the jolliest lark i ve been blessed with since we licked spain promptly on time the counterfeit presentment of mounted policeman o roon single footed into the park on his chestnut steed in a uniform two men who are unlike will look alike two who somewhat resemble each other in feature and figure will appear as twin brothers so remsen trotted down the bridle paths enjoying himself hugely so few real pleasures do ten millionaires have along the driveway in the early morning spun a victoria drawn by a pair of fiery bays there was something foreign about the affair for the park is rarely used in the morning except by unimportant people who love to be healthy poor and wise in the vehicle sat an old gentleman with snowy side whiskers and a scotch plaid cap which could not be worn while driving except by a personage at his side sat the lady of remsen s heart the lady who looked like pomegranate blossoms and the gibbous moon remsen met them coming at the instant of their passing her eyes looked into his and but for the ever coward s heart of a true lover he could have sworn that she flushed a faint pink he trotted on for twenty yards and then wheeled his horse at the sound of runaway hoofs the bays had bolted remsen sent his chestnut after the victoria like a shot there was work cut out for the impersonator of policeman o roon the chestnut ranged alongside the off bay thirty seconds after the chase began rolled his eye back at remsen and said in the only manner open to policemen s horses well you duffer are you going to do your share you re not o roon but it seems to me if you d lean to the right you could reach the reins of that foolish slow running bay ah you re all right o roon couldn t have done it more neatly the runaway team was tugged to an inglorious halt by remsen s tough muscles the driver released his hands from the wrapped reins jumped from his seat and stood at the heads of the team the chestnut approving his new rider danced and pranced reviling equinely the subdued bays remsen lingering was dimly conscious of a vague impossible unnecessary old gentleman in a scotch cap who talked incessantly about something and he was acutely conscious of a pair of violet eyes that would have drawn saint pyrites from his iron pillar or whatever the allusion is and of the lady s smile and look a little frightened but a look that with the ever coward hears of a true lover he could not yet construe they were asking his name and bestowing upon him wellbred thanks for his heroic deed and the scotch cap was especially babbling and insistent but the eloquent appeal was in the eyes of the lady a little thrill of satisfaction ran through remsen because he had a name to give which without undue pride was worthy of being spoken in high places and a small fortune which with due pride he could leave at his end without disgrace he opened his lips to speak and closed them again who was he mounted policeman o roon the badge and the honor of his comrade were in his hands if ellsworth remsen ten millionaire and knickerbocker had just rescued pomegranate blossoms and scotch cap from possible death where was policeman o roon off his beat exposed disgraced discharged love had come but before that there had been something that demanded precedence the fellowship of men on battlefields fighting an alien foe remsen touched his cap looked between the chestnut s ears and took refuge in vernacularity don t mention it he said stolidly we policemen are paid to do these things it s our duly and he rode away rode away cursing noblesse oblige but knowing he could never have clone anything else at the end of the day remsen sent the chestnut to his stable and went to o roon s room the policeman was again a well set up affable cool young man who sat by the window smoking cigars i wish you and the rest of the police force and all badges horses brass buttons and men who can t drink two glasses of brut without getting upset were at the devil said remsen feelingly o roon smiled with evident satisfaction good old remsen he said affably i know all about it they trailed me down and cornered me here two hours ago there was a little row at home you know and i cut sticks just to show them i don t believe i told you that my governor was the earl of ardsley funny you should bob against them in the park if you damaged that horse of mine i ll never forgive you i m going to buy him and take him back with me oh yes and i think my sister lady angela you know wants particularly for you to come up to the hotel with me this evening didn t lose my badge did you remsen i ve got to turn that in at headquarters when i resign brickdust row blinker was displeased a man of less culture and poise and wealth would have sworn but blinker always remembered that he was a gentleman a thing that no gentleman should do so he merely looked bored and sardonic while he rode in a hansom to the center of disturbance which was the broadway office of lawyer oldport who was agent for the blinker estate i don t see said blinker why i should be always signing confounded papers i am packed and was to have left for the north woods this morning now i must wait until to morrow morning i hate night trains my best razors are of course at the bottom of some unidentifiable trunk it is a plot to drive me to bay rum and a monologueing thumb handed barber give me a pen that doesn t scratch i hate pens that scratch sit down said double chinned gray lawyer oldport the worst has not been told you oh the hardships of the rich the papers are not yet ready to sign they will be laid before you to morrow at eleven you will miss another day twice shall the barber tweak the helpless nose of a blinker be thankful that your sorrows do not embrace a haircut if said blinker rising the act did not involve more signing of papers i would take my business out of your hands at once give me a cigar please if said lawyer oldport i had cared to see an old friend s son gulped down at one mouthful by sharks i would have ordered you to take it away long ago now let s quit fooling alexander besides the grinding task of signing your name some thirty times to morrow i must impose upon you the consideration of a matter of business of business and i may say humanity or right i spoke to you about this five years ago but you would not listen you were in a hurry for a coaching trip i think the subject has come up again the property oh property interrupted blinker dear mr oldport i think you mentioned to morrow let s have it all at one dose to morrow signatures and property and snappy rubber bands and that smelly sealing wax and all have luncheon with me well i ll try to remember to drop in at eleven to morrow morning the blinker wealth was in lands tenements and hereditaments as the legal phrase goes lawyer oldport had once taken alexander in his little pulmonary gasoline runabout to see the many buildings and rows of buildings that he owned in the city for alexander was sole heir they had amused blinker very much the houses looked so incapable of producing the big sums of money that lawyer oldport kept pilling up in banks for him to spend in the evening blinker went to one of his clubs intending to dine nobody was there except some old fogies playing whist who spoke to him with grave politeness and glared at him with savage contempt everybody was out of town but here he was kept in like a schoolboy to write his name over and over on pieces of paper his wounds were deep blinker turned his back on the fogies and said to the club steward who had come forward with some nonsense about cold fresh salmon roe symons i m going to coney island he said it as one might say all s off i m going to jump into the river the joke pleased symons he laughed within a sixteenth of a note of the audibility permitted by the laws governing employees certainly sir he tittered of course sir i think i can see you at coney mr blinker blinker got a pager and looked up the movements of sunday steamboats then he found a cab at the first corner and drove to a north river pier he stood in line as democratic as you or i and bought a ticket and was trampled upon and shoved forward until at last he found himself on the upper deck of the boat staring brazenly at a girl who sat alone upon a camp stool but blinker did not intend to be brazen the girl was so wonderfully good looking that he forgot for one minute that he was the prince incog and behaved just as he did in society she was looking at him too and not severely a puff of wind threatened blinker s straw hat he caught it warily and settled it again the movement gave the effect of a bow the girl nodded and smiled and in another instant he was seated at her side she was dressed all in white she was paler than blinker imagined milkmaids and girls of humble stations to be but she was as tidy as a cherry blossom and her steady supremely frank gray eyes looked out from the intrepid depths of an unshadowed and untroubled soul how dare you raise your hat to me she asked with a smile redeemed severity i didn t blinker said but he quickly covered the mistake by extending it to i didn t know how to keep from it after i saw you i do not allow gentlemen to sit by me to whom i have not been introduced she said with a sudden haughtiness that deceived him he rose reluctantly but her clear teasing laugh brought him down to his chair again i guess you weren t going far she declared with beauty s magnificent self confidence are you going to coney island asked blinker me she turned upon him wide open eyes full of bantering surprise why what a question can t you see that i m riding a bicycle in the park her drollery took the form of impertinence and i am laying brick on a tall factory chimney said blinker mayn t we see coney together i m all alone and i ve never been there before it depends said the girl on how nicely you behave i ll consider your application until we get there blinker took pains to provide against the rejection of his application he strove to please to adopt the metaphor of his nonsensical phrase he laid brick upon brick on the tall chimney of his devoirs until at length the structure was stable and complete the manners of the best society come around finally to simplicity and as the girl s way was that naturally they were on a mutual plane of communication from the beginning he learned that she was twenty and her name was florence that she trimmed hats in a millinery shop that she lived in a furnished room with her best chum elia who was cashier in a shoe store and that a glass of milk from the bottle on the window sill and an egg that boils itself while you twist up your hair makes a breakfast good enough for any one florence laughed when she heard blinker well she said it certainly slows that you have imagination it gives the smiths a chance for a little rest anyhow they landed at coney and were dashed on the crest of a great human wave of mad pleasure seekers into the walks and avenues of fairyland gone into vaudeville with a curious eye a critical mind and a fairly withheld judgment blinker considered the temples pagodas and kiosks of popularized delights hoi polloi trampled hustled and crowded him basket parties bumped him sticky children tumbled howling under his feet candying his clothes insolent youths strolling among the booths with hard won canes under one arm and easily won girls on the other blew defiant smoke from cheap cigars into his face the publicity gentlemen with megaphones each before his own stupendous attraction roared like niagara in his ears music of all kinds that could be tortured from brass reed hide or string fought in the air to grain space for its vibrations against its competitors but what held blinker in awful fascination was the mob the multitude the proletariat shrieking struggling hurrying panting hurling itself in incontinent frenzy with unabashed abandon into the ridiculous sham palaces of trumpery and tinsel pleasures the vulgarity of it its brutal overriding of all the tenets of repression and taste that were held by his caste repelled him strongly in the midst of his disgust he turned and looked down at florence by his side she was ready with her quick smile and upturned happy eyes as bright and clear as the water in trout pools the eyes were saying that they had the right to be shining and happy for was their owner not with her for the present man her gentleman friend and holder of the keys to the enchanted city of fun blinker did not read her look accurately but by some miracle he suddenly saw coney aright he no longer saw a mass of vulgarians seeking gross joys he now looked clearly upon a hundred thousand true idealists their offenses were wiped out counterfeit and false though the garish joys of these spangled temples were he perceived that deep under the gilt surface they offered saving and apposite balm and satisfaction to the restless human heart here at least was the husk of romance the empty but shining casque of chivalry the breath catching though safe guarded dip and flight of adventure the magic carpet that transports you to the realms of fairyland though its journey be trough but a few poor yards of space he no longer saw a rabble but his brothers seeking the ideal there was no magic of poesy here or of art but the glamour of their imagination turned yellow calico into cloth of gold and the megaphones into the silver trumpets of joy s heralds almost humbled blinker rolled up the shirt sleeves of his mind and joined the idealists you are the lady doctor he said to florence how shall we go about doing this jolly conglomeration of fairy tales incorporated we will begin there said the princess pointing to a fun pagoda on the edge of the sea and we will take there all in one by one they caught the eight o clock returning boat and sat filled with pleasant fatigue against the rail in the bow listening to the italians fiddle and harp blinker had thrown off all care the north woods seemed to him an uninhabitable wilderness what a fuss he had made over signing his name pooh he could sign it a hundred times and her name was as pretty as she was florence he said it to himself a great many times as the boat was nearing its pier in the north river a two funnelled drab foreign looking sea going steamer was dropping down toward the bay the boat turned its nose in toward its slip the steamer veered as if to seek midstream and then yawed seemed to increase its speed and struck the coney boat on the side near the stern cutting into it with a terrifying shock and crash while the six hundred passengers on the boat were mostly tumbling about the decks in a shrieking panic the captain was shouting at the steamer that it should not back off and leave the rent exposed for the water to enter but the steamer tore its way out like a savage sawfish and cleaved its heartless way full speed ahead the boat began to sink at its stern but moved slowly toward the slip the passengers were a frantic mob unpleasant to behold blinker held florence tightly until the boat had righted itself she made no sound or sign of fear he stood on a camp stool ripped off the slats above his head and pulled down a number of the life preservers he began to buckle one around florence the rotten canvas split and the fraudulent granulated cork came pouring out in a stream florence caught a handful of it and laughed gleefully it looks like breakfast food she said take it off they re no good she unbuckled it and threw it on the deck she made blinker sit down and sat by his side and put her hand in his what ll you bet we don t reach the pier all right she said and began to hum a song and now the captain moved among the passengers and compelled order the boat would undoubtedly make her slip he said and ordered the women and children to the bow where they could land first the boat very low in the water at the stern tried gallantly to make his promise good florence said blinker as she held him close by an arm and hand i love you that s what they all say she replied lightly i am not one of they all he persisted i never knew any one i could love before i could pass my life with you and be happy every day i am rich i can make things all right for you that s what they all say said the girl again weaving the words into her little reckless song don t say that again said blinker in a tone that made her look at him in frank surprise why shouldn t i say it she asked calmly they all do who are they he asked jealous for the first time in his existence why the fellows i know do you know so many oh well i m not a wall flower she answered with modest complacency where do you see these these men at your home of course not i meet them just as i did you sometimes on the boat sometimes in the park sometimes on the street i m a pretty good judge of a man i can tell in a minute if a fellow is one who is likely to get fresh what do you mean by fresh why try to kiss you me i mean do any of them try that asked blinker clenching his teeth sure all men do you know that do you allow them some not many they won t take you out anywhere unless you do she turned her head and looked searchingly at blinker her eyes were as innocent as a child s there was a puzzled look in them as though she did not understand him what s wrong about my meeting fellows she asked wonderingly everything he answered almost savagely why don t you entertain your company in the house where you live is it necessary to pick up tom dick and harry on the streets she kept her absolutely ingenuous eyes upon his if you could see the place where i live you wouldn t ask that i live in brickdust row they call it that because there s red dust from the bricks crumbling over everything i ve lived there for more than four years there s no place to receive company you can t have anybody come to your room what else is there to do a girl has got to meet the men hasn t she yes he said hoarsely a girl has got to meet a has got to meet the men the first time one spoke to me on the street she continued i ran home and cried all night but you get used to it i meet a good many nice fellows at church i go on rainy days and stand in the vestibule until one comes up with an umbrella i wish there was a parlor so i could ask you to call mr blinker are you really sure it isn t smith now the boat landed safely blinker had a confused impression of walking with the girl through quiet crosstown streets until she stopped at a corner and held out her hand i live just one more block over she said thank you for a very pleasant afternoon blinker muttered something and plunged northward till he found a cab a big gray church loomed slowly at his right blinker shook his fist at it through the window i gave you a thousand dollars last week he cried under his breath and she meets them in your very doors there is something wrong there is something wrong at eleven the next day blinker signed his name thirty times with a new pen provided by lawyer oldport now let me go to the woods he said surlily you are not looking well said lawyer oldport the trip will do you good but listen if you will to that little matter of business of which i spoke to you yesterday and also five years ago there are some buildings fifteen in number of which there are new five year leases to be signed your father contemplated a change in the lease provisions but never made it he intended that the parlors of these houses should not be sub let but that the tenants should be allowed to use them for reception rooms these houses are in the shopping district and are mainly tenanted by young working girls as it is they are forced to seek companionship outside this row of red brick blinker interrupted him with a loud discordant laugh brickdust row for an even hundred he cried and i own it have i guessed right the tenants have some such name for it said lawyer oldport blinker arose and jammed his hat down to his eyes do what you please with it he said harshly remodel it burn it raze it to the ground but man it s too late i tell you it s too late it s too late it s too late the making of a new yorker besides many other things raggles was a poet he was called a tramp but that was only an elliptical way of saying that he was a philosopher an artist a traveller a naturalist and a discoverer but most of all he was a poet in all his life he never wrote a line of verse he lived his poetry his odyssey would have been a limerick had it been written but to linger with the primary proposition raggles was a poet raggles s specialty had he been driven to ink and paper would have been sonnets to the cities he studied cities as women study their reflections in mirrors as children study the glue and sawdust of a dislocated doll as the men who write about wild animals study the cages in the zoo a city to raggles was not merely a pile of bricks and mortar peopled by a certain number of inhabitants it was a thing with a soul characteristic and distinct an individual conglomeration of life with its own peculiar essence flavor and feeling two thousand miles to the north and south east and west raggles wandered in poetic fervor taking the cities to his breast he footed it on dusty roads or sped magnificently in freight cars counting time as of no account and when he had found the heart of a city and listened to its secret confession he strayed on restless to another fickle raggles but perhaps he had not met the civic corporation that could engage and hold his critical fancy through the ancient poets we have learned that the cities are feminine so they were to poet raggles and his mind carried a concrete and clear conception of the figure that symbolized and typified each one that he had wooed chicago seemed to swoop down upon him with a breezy suggestion of mrs partington plumes and patchouli and to disturb his rest with a soaring and beautiful song of future promise but raggles would awake to a sense of shivering cold and a haunting impression of ideals lost in a depressing aura of potato salad and fish thus chicago affected him perhaps there is a vagueness and inaccuracy in the description but that is raggles s fault he should have recorded his sensations in magazine poems pittsburg impressed hint as the play of othello performed in the russian language in a railroad station by dockstader s minstrels a royal and generous lady this pittsburg though homely hearty with flushed face washing the dishes in a silk dress and white kid slippers and bidding raggles sit before the roaring fireplace and drink champagne with his pigs feet and fried potatoes new orleans had simply gazed down upon him from a balcony he could see her pensive starry eves and catch the flutter of her fan and that was all only once he came face to face with her it was at dawn when she was flushing the red bricks of the banquette with a pail of water she laughed and hummed a chansonette and filled raggles s shoes with ice cold water allons boston construed herself to the poetic raggles in an erratic and singular way it seemed to him that he had drunk cold tea and that the city was a white cold cloth that had been bound tightly around his brow to spur him to some unknown but tremendous mental effort and after all he came to shovel snow for a livelihood and the cloth becoming wet tightened its knots and could not be removed indefinite and unintelligible ideas you will say but your disapprobation should be tempered with gratitude for these are poets fancies and suppose you had come upon them in verse one day raggles came and laid siege to the heart of the great city of manhattan she was the greatest of all and he wanted to learn her note in the scale to taste and appraise and classify and solve and label her and arrange her with the other cities that had given him up the secret of their individuality and here we cease to be raggles s translator and become his chronicler raggles landed from a ferry boat one morning and walked into the core of the town with the blase air of a cosmopolite he was dressed with care to play the role of an unidentified man no country race class clique union party clan or bowling association could have claimed him his clothing which had been donated to him piece meal by citizens of different height but same number of inches around the heart was not yet as uncomfortable to his figure as those speciments of raiment self measured that are railroaded to you by transcontinental tailors with a suit case suspenders sills handkerchief and pearl studs as a bonus without money as a poet should be but with the ardor of an astronomer discovering a new star in the chorus of the milky way or a man who has seen ink suddenly flow from his fountain pen raggles wandered into the great city late in the afternoon he drew out of the roar and commotion with a look of dumb terror on his countenance he was defeated puzzled discomfited frightened other cities had been to him as long primer to read as country maidens quickly to fathom as send price of subscription with answer rebuses to solve as oyster cocktails to swallow but here was one as cold glittering serene impossible as a four carat diamond in a window to a lover outside fingering damply in his pocket his ribbon counter salary the greetings of the other cities he had known their homespun kindliness their human gamut of rough charity friendly curses garrulous curiosity and easily estimated credulity or indifference this city of manhattan gave him no clue it was walled against him like a river of adamant it flowed past him in the streets never an eye was turned upon him no voice spoke to him his heart yearned for the clap of pittsburg s sooty hand on his shoulder for chicago s menacing but social yawp in his ear for the pale and eleemosynary stare through the bostonian eyeglass even for the precipitate but unmalicious boot toe of louisville or st louis on broadway raggles successful suitor of many cities stood bashful like any country swain for the first time he experienced the poignant humiliation of being ignored and when he tried to reduce this brilliant swiftly changing ice cold city to a formula he failed utterly poet though he was it offered him no color similes no points of comparison no flaw in its polished facets no handle by which he could hold it up and view its shape and structure as he familiarly and often contemptuously had done with other towns the houses were interminable ramparts loopholed for defense the people were bright but bloodless spectres passing in sinister and selfish array the thing that weighed heaviest on raggles s soul and clogged his poet s fancy was the spirit of absolute egotism that seemed to saturate the people as toys are saturated with paint each one that he considered appeared a monster of abominable and insolent conceit humanity was gone from them they were toddling idols of stone and varnish worshipping themselves and greedy for though oblivious of worship from their fellow graven images frozen cruel implacable impervious cut to an identical pattern they hurried on their ways like statues brought by some miracles to motion while soul and feeling lay unaroused in the reluctant marble gradually raggles became conscious of certain types one was an elderly gentleman with a snow white short beard pink unwrinkled face and stony sharp blue eyes attired in the fashion of a gilded youth who seemed to personify the city s wealth ripeness and frigid unconcern another type was a woman tall beautiful clear as a steel engraving goddess like calm clothed like the princesses of old with eyes as coldly blue as the reflection of sunlight on a glacier and another was a by product of this town of marionettes a broad swaggering grim threateningly sedate fellow with a jowl as large as a harvested wheat field the complexion of a baptized infant and the knuckles of a prize fighter this type leaned against cigar signs and viewed the world with frapped contumely a poet is a sensitive creature and raggles soon shrivelled in the bleak embrace of the undecipherable the chill sphinx like ironical illegible unnatural ruthless expression of the city left him downcast and bewildered had it no heart better the woodpile the scolding of vinegar faced housewives at back doors the kindly spleen of bartenders behind provincial free lunch counters the amiable truculence of rural constables the kicks arrests and happy go lucky chances of the other vulgar loud crude cities than this freezing heartlessness raggles summoned his courage and sought alms from the populace unheeding regardless they passed on without the wink of an eyelash to testify that they were conscious of his existence and then he said to himself that this fair but pitiless city of manhattan was without a soul that its inhabitants were manikins moved by wires and springs and that he was alone in a great wilderness raggles started to cross the street there was a blast a roar a hissing and a crash as something struck him and hurled him over and over six yards from where he had been as he was coming down like the stick of a rocket the earth and all the cities thereof turned to a fractured dream raggles opened his eyes first an odor made itself known to him an odor of the earliest spring flowers of paradise and then a hand soft as a falling petal touched his brow bending over him was the woman clothed like the princess of old with blue eyes now soft and humid with human sympathy under his head on the pavement were silks and furs with raggles s hat in his hand and with his face pinker than ever from a vehement burst of oratory against reckless driving stood the elderly gentleman who personified the city s wealth and ripeness from a nearby cafe hurried the by product with the vast jowl and baby complexion bearing a glass full of a crimson fluid that suggested delightful possibilities drink dis sport said the by product holding the glass to raggles s lips hundreds of people huddled around in a moment their faces wearing the deepest concern two flattering and gorgeous policemen got into the circle and pressed back the overplus of samaritans an old lady in a black shawl spoke loudly of camphor a newsboy slipped one of his papers beneath raggles s elbow where it lay on the muddy pavement a brisk young man with a notebook was asking for names a bell clanged importantly and the ambulance cleaned a lane through the crowd a cool surgeon slipped into the midst of affairs how do you feel old man asked the surgeon stooping easily to his task the princess of silks and satins wiped a red drop or two from raggles s brow with a fragrant cobweb me said raggles with a seraphic smile i feel fine he had found the heart of his new city in three days they let him leave his cot for the convalescent ward in the hospital he had been in there an hour when the attendants heard sounds of conflict upon investigation they found that raggles had assaulted and damaged a brother convalescent a glowering transient whom a freight train collision had sent in to be patched up what s all this about inquired the head nurse he was runnin down me town said raggles what town asked the nurse noo york said raggles vanity and some sables when kid brady was sent to the rope by molly mckeever s blue black eyes he withdrew from the stovepipe gang so much for the power of a colleen s blanderin tongue and stubborn true heartedness if you are a man who read this may such an influence be sent you before o clock to morrow if you are a woman may your pomeranian greet you this morning with a cold nose a sign of doghealth and your happiness the stovepipe gang borrowed its name from a sub district of the city called the stovepipe which is a narrow and natural extension of the familiar district known as hell s kitchen the stovepipe strip of town runs along eleventh and twelfth avenues on the river and bends a hard and sooty elbow around little lost homeless dewitt clinton park consider that a stovepipe is an important factor in any kitchen and the situation is analyzed tae chefs in hell s kitchen are many and the stovepipe gang wears the cordon blue the members of this unchartered but widely known brotherhood appeared to pass their time on street corners arrayed like the lilies of the conservatory and busy with nail files and penknives thus displayed as a guarantee of good faith they carried on an innocuous conversation in a word vocabulary to the casual observer as innocent and immaterial as that heard in clubs seven blocks to the east but off exhibition the stovepipes were not mere street corner ornaments addicted to posing and manicuring their serious occupation was the separating of citizens from their coin and valuables preferably this was done by weird and singular tricks without noise or bloodshed but whenever the citizen honored by their attentions refused to impoverish himself gracefully his objections came to be spread finally upon some police station blotter or hospital register the police held the stovepipe gang in perpetual suspicion and respect as the nightingale s liquid note is heard in the deepest shadows so along the stovepipe s dark and narrow confess the whistle for reserves punctures the dull ear of night whenever there was smoke in the stovepipe the tasselled men in blue knew there was fire in hell s kitchen kid brady promised molly to be good kid was the vainest the strongest the wariest and the most successful plotter in the gang therefore the boys were sorry to give him up but they witnessed his fall to a virtuous life with out protest for in the kitchen it is considered neither unmanly nor improper for a guy to do as his girl advises black her eye for love s sake if you will but it is all to the good business to do a thing when she wants you to do it turn off the hydrant said the kid one night when molly tearful besought him to amend his ways i m going to cut out the gang you for mine and the simple life on the side i ll tell you moll i ll get work and in a year we ll get married i ll do it for you we ll get a flat and a flute and a sewing machine and a rubber plant and live as honest as we can oh kid sighed molly wiping the powder off his shoulder with her handkerchief i d rather hear you say that than to own all of new york and we can be happy on so little the kid looked down at his speckless cuffs and shining patent leathers with a suspicion of melancholy it ll hurt hardest in the rags department said he i ve kind of always liked to rig out swell when i could you know how i hate cheap things moll this suit set me back sixty five anything in the wearing apparel line has got to be just so or it s to the misfit parlors for it for mine if i work i won t have so much coin to hand over to the little roan with the big shears never mind kid i ll like you just as much in a blue jumper as i would in a red automobile before the kid had grown large enough to knock out his father he had been compelled to learn the plumber s art so now back to this honorable and useful profession he returned but it was as an assistant that he engaged himself and it is the master plumber and not the assistant who wears diamonds as large as hailstones and looks contemptuously upon the marble colonnades of senator clark s mansion eight months went by as smoothly and surely as though they had elapsed on a theater program the kid worked away at his pipes and solder with no symptoms of backsliding the stovepipe gang continued its piracy on the high avenues cracked policemen s heads held up late travelers invented new methods of peaceful plundering copied fifth avenue s cut of clothes and neckwear fancies and comported itself according to its lawless bylaws but the kid stood firm and faithful to his molly even though the polish was gone from his fingernails and it took him minutes to tie his purple silk ascot so that the worn places would not show one evening he brought a mysterious bundle with him to molly s house open that moll he said in his large quiet way it s for you molly s eager fingers tore off the wrappings she shrieked aloud and in rushed a sprinkling of little mckeevers and ma mckeever dishwashy but an undeniable relative of the late mrs eve again molly shrieked and something dark and long and sinuous flew and enveloped her neck like an anaconda russian sables said the kid pridefully enjoying the sight of molly s round cheek against the clinging fur the real thing they don t grow anything in russia too good for you moll molly plunged her hands into the muff overturned a row of the family infants and flew to the mirror hint for the beauty column to make bright eyes rosy checks and a bewitching smile recipe one set russian sables apply when they were alone molly became aware of a small cake of the ice of common sense floating down the full tide of her happiness you re a bird all right kid she admitted gratefully i never had any furs on before in my life but ain t russian sables awful expensive seems to me i ve heard they were have i ever chucked any bargain sale stuff at you moll asked the kid with calm dignity did you ever notice me leaning on the remnant counter or peering in the window of the five and ten call that scarf and the muff and you won t make any mistake about the price of russian sables the swell goods for me say they look fine on you moll molly hugged the sables to her bosom in rapture and then her smile went away little by little and she looked the kid straight in the eye sadly and steadily he knew what every look of hers meant and he laughed with a faint flush upon his face cut it out he said with affectionate roughness i told you i was done with that i bought em and paid for em all right with my own money out of the money you worked for kid out of a month sure i been saving up let s see saved in eight months kid ah let up said the kid with some heat i had some money when i went to work do you think i ve been holding em up again i told you i d quit they re paid for on the square put em on and come out for a walk molly calmed her doubts sables are soothing proud as a queen she went forth in the streets at the kid s side in all that region of low lying streets russian sables had never been seen before the word sped and doors and windows blossomed with heads eager to see the swell furs kid brady had given his girl all down the street there were oh s and ah s and the reported fabulous sum paid for the sables was passed from lip to lip increasing as it went at her right elbow sauntered the kid with the air of princes work had not diminished his love of pomp and show and his passion for the costly and genuine on a corner they saw a group of the stovepipe gang loafing immaculate they raised their hats to the kid s girl and went on with their calm unaccented palaver three blocks behind the admired couple strolled detective ransom of the central office ransom was the only detective on the force who could walk abroad with safety in the stovepipe district he was fair dealing and unafraid and went there with the hypothesis that the inhabitants were human many liked him and now and then one would tip off to him something that he was

empty street near the river bank he touched the kid s arm from behind let me see you a moment brady he said quietly his eye rested for a second on the long fur scarf thrown stylishly back over molly s

pipe asked ransom i did said the kid what of it the lady s set of russian sables went out of the house about the same time you did the description fits the ones this lady has on to h harlem with you

too good for you if they cost a million molly with anguish in her face hung upon the kid s arm oh kiddy you ve broke my heart she said i was so proud of you and now they ll do you and where s our

said policeman kohen to ransom come on away the social triangle at the stroke of six ikey snigglefritz laid down his goose ikey was a tailor s apprentice are there tailor s apprentices nowadays at any rate ikey toiled and snipped and basted and pressed and patched and sponged all day in the steamy fetor of a tailor shop but when work was done ikey hitched his wagon to such stars as his firmament let shine it was saturday night and the boss laid twelve begrimed and begrudged dollars in his hand ikey dabbled discreetly in water donned coat hat and collar with its frazzled tie and chalcedony pin and set forth in pursuit of his ideals for each of us when our day s work is done must seek our ideal whether it be love or pinochle or lobster a la newburg or the sweet silence of the musty bookshelves behold ikey as he ambles up the street beneath the roaring el between the rows of reeking sweatshops pallid stooping insignificant squalid doomed to exist forever in penury of body and mind yet as he swings his cheap cane and projects the noisome inhalations from his cigarette you perceive that he nurtures in his narrow bosom the bacillus of society ikey s legs carried him to and into that famous place of entertainment known as the cafe maginnis famous because it was the rendezvous of billy mcmahan the greatest man the most wonderful man ikey thought that the world had ever produced billy mcmahan was the district leader upon him the tiger purred and his hand held manna to scatter now as ikey entered mcmahan stood flushed and triumphant and mighty the centre of a huzzaing concourse of his lieutenants and constituents it seems there had been an election a signal victory had been won the city had been swept back into line by a resistless besom of ballots ikey slunk along the bar and gazed breath quickened at his idol how magnificent was billy mcmahan with his great smooth laughing face his gray eye shrewd as a chicken hawk s his diamond ring his voice like a bugle call his prince s air his plump and active roll of money his clarion call to friend and comrade oh what a king of men he was how he obscured his lieutenants though they themselves loomed large and serious blue of chin and important of mien with hands buried deep in the pockets of their short overcoats but billy oh what small avail are words to paint for you his glory as seen by ikey snigglefritz the cafe maginnis rang to the note of victory the white coated bartenders threw themselves featfully upon bottle cork and glass from a score of clear havanas the air received its paradox of clouds the leal and the hopeful shook billy mcmahan s hand and there was born suddenly in the worshipful soul of ikey snigglefritz an audacious thrilling impulse he stepped forward into the little cleared space in which majesty moved and held out his hand billy mcmahan grasped it unhesitatingly shook it and smiled made mad now by the gods who were about to destroy him ikey threw away his scabbard and charged upon olympus have a drink with me billy he said familiarly you and your friends don t mind if i do old man said the great leader just to keep the ball rolling the last spark of ikey s reason fled wine he called to the bartender waving a trembling hand the corks of three bottles were drawn the champagne bubbled in the long row of glasses set upon the bar billy mcmahan took his and nodded with his beaming smile at ikey the lieutenants and satellites took theirs and growled here s to you ikey took his nectar in delirium all drank ikey threw his week s wages in a crumpled roll upon the bar c rect said the bartender smoothing the twelve one dollar notes the crowd surged around billy mcmahan again some one was telling how brannigan fixed em over in the eleventh ikey leaned against the bar a while and then went out he went down hester street and up chrystie and down delancey to where he lived and there his women folk a bibulous mother and three dingy sisters pounced upon him for his wages and at his confession they shrieked and objurgated him in the pithy rhetoric of the locality but even as they plucked at him and struck him ikey remained in his ecstatic trance of joy his head was in the clouds the star was drawing his wagon compared with what he had achieved the loss of wages and the bray of women s tongues were slight affairs he had shaken the hand of billy mcmahan billy mcmahan had a wife and upon her visiting cards was engraved the name mrs william darragh mcmahan and there was a certain vexation attendant upon these cards for small as they were there were houses in which they could not be inserted billy mcmahan was a dictator in politics a four walled tower in business a mogul dreaded loved and obeyed among his own people he was growing rich the daily papers had a dozen men on his trail to chronicle his every word of wisdom he had been honored in caricature holding the tiger cringing in leash but the heart of billy was sometimes sore within him there was a race of men from which he stood apart but that he viewed with the eye of moses looking over into the promised land he too had ideals even as had ikey snigglefritz and sometimes hopeless of attaining them his own solid success was as dust and ashes in his mouth and mrs william darragh mcmahan wore a look of discontent upon her plump but pretty face and the very rustle of her silks seemed a sigh there was a brave and conspicuous assemblage in the dining saloon of a noted hostelry where fashion loves to display her charms at one table sat billy mcmahan and his wife mostly silent they were but the accessories they enjoyed little needed the indorsement of speech mrs mcmahan s diamonds were outshone by few in the room the waiter bore the costliest brands of wine to their table in evening dress with an expression of gloom upon his smooth and massive countenance you would look in vain for a more striking figure than billy s four tables away sat alone a tall slender man about thirty with thoughtful melancholy eyes a van dyke beard and peculiarly white thin hands he was dining on filet mignon dry toast and apollinaris that man was cortlandt van duyckink a man worth eighty millions who inherited and held a sacred seat in the exclusive inner circle of society billy mcmahan spoke to no one around him because he knew no one van duyckink kept his eyes on his plate because he knew that every one present was hungry to catch his he could bestow knighthood and prestige by a nod and he was chary of creating a too extensive nobility and then billy mcmahan conceived and accomplished the most startling and audacious act of his life he rose deliberately and walked over to cortlandt van duyckink s table and held out his hand say mr van duyckink he said i ve heard you was talking about starting some reforms among the poor people down in my district i m mcmahan you know say now if that s straight i ll do all i can to help you and what i says goes in that neck of the woods don t it oh say i rather guess it does van duyckink s rather sombre eyes lighted up he rose to his lank height and grasped billy mcmahan s hand thank you mr mcmahan he said in his deep serious tones i have been thinking of doing some work of that sort i shall be glad of your assistance it pleases me to have become acquainted with you billy walked back to his seat his shoulder was tingling from the accolade bestowed by royalty a hundred eyes were now turned upon him in envy and new admiration mrs william darragh mcmahan trembled with ecstasy so that her diamonds smote the eye almost with pain and now it was apparent that at many tables there were those who suddenly remembered that they enjoyed mr mcmahan s acquaintance he saw smiles and bows about him he became enveloped in the aura of dizzy greatness his campaign coolness deserted him wine for that gang he commanded the waiter pointing with his finger wine over there wine to those three gents by that green bush tell em it s on me d n it wine for everybody the waiter ventured to whisper that it was perhaps inexpedient to carry out the order in consideration of the dignity of the house and its custom all right said billy if it s against the rules i wonder if twould do to send my friend van duyckink a bottle no well it ll flow all right at the caffy to night just the same it ll be rubber boots for anybody who comes in there any time up to a m billy mcmahan was happy he had shaken the hand of cortlandt van duyckink the big pale gray auto with its shining metal work looked out of place moving slowly among the push carts and trash heaps on the lower east side so did cortlandt van duyckink with his aristocratic face and white thin hands as he steered carefully between the groups of ragged scurrying youngsters in the streets and so did miss constance schuyler with her dim ascetic beauty seated at his side oh cortlandt she breathed isn t it sad that human beings have to live in such wretchedness and poverty and you how noble it is of you to think of them to give your time and money to improve their condition van duyckink turned his solemn eyes upon her it is little he said sadly that i can do the question is a large one and belongs to society but even individual effort is not thrown away look constance on this street i have arranged to build soup kitchens where no one who is hungry will be turned away and down this other street are the old buildings that i shall cause to be torn down and there erect others in place of those death traps of fire and disease down delancey slowly crept the pale gray auto away from it toddled coveys of wondering tangle haired barefooted unwashed children it stopped before a crazy brick structure foul and awry van duyckink alighted to examine at a better perspective one of the leaning walls down the steps of the building came a young man who seemed to epitomize its degradation squalor and infelicity a narrow chested pale unsavory young man puffing at a cigarette obeying a sudden impulse van duyckink stepped out and warmly grasped the hand of what seemed to him a living rebuke i want to know you people he said sincerely i am going to help you as much as i can we shall be friends as the auto crept carefully away cortlandt van duyckink felt an unaccustomed glow about his heart he was near to being a happy man he had shaken the hand of ikey snigglefritz the purple dress we are to consider the shade known as purple it is a color justly in repute among the sons and daughters of man emperors claim it for their especial dye good fellows everywhere seek to bring their noses to the genial hue that follows the commingling of the red and blue we say of princes that they are born to the purple and no doubt they are for the colic tinges their faces with the royal tint equally with the snub nosed countenance of a woodchopper s brat all women love it when it is the fashion and now purple is being worn you notice it on the streets of course other colors are quite stylish as well in fact i saw a lovely thing the other day in olive green albatross with a triple lapped flounce skirt trimmed with insert squares of silk and a draped fichu of lace opening over a shirred vest and double puff sleeves with a lace band holding two gathered frills but you see lots of purple too oh yes you do just take a walk down twenty third street any afternoon therefore maida the girl with the big brown eyes and cinnamon colored hair in the bee hive store said to grace the girl with the rhinestone brooch and peppermint pepsin flavor to her speech i m going to have a purple dress a tailor made purple dress for thanksgiving oh are you said grace putting away some gloves into the box well it s me for red you see more red on fifth avenue and the men all seem to like it i like purple best said maida and old schlegel has promised to make it for it s going to be lovely i m going to have a plaited skirt and a blouse coat trimmed with a band of galloon under a white cloth collar with two rows of sly boots said grace with an educated wink soutache braid over a surpliced white vest and a plaited basque and sly boots sly boots repeated grace plaited gigot sleeves with a drawn velvet ribbon over an inside cuff what do you mean by saying that you think mr ramsay likes purple i heard him say yesterday he thought some of the dark shades of red were stunning i don t care said maida i prefer purple and them that don t like it can just take the other side of the street which suggests the thought that after all the followers of purple may be subject to slight delusions danger is near when a maiden thinks she can wear purple regardless of complexions and opinions and when emperors think their purple robes will wear forever maida had saved after eight months of economy and this had bought the goods for the purple dress and paid schlegel on the making of it on the day before thanksgiving she would have just enough to pay the remaining and then for a holiday in a new dress can earth offer anything more enchanting old bachman the proprietor of the bee hive store always gave a thanksgiving dinner to his employees on every one of the subsequent days excusing sundays he would remind them of the joys of the past banquet and the hopes of the coming ones thus inciting them to increased enthusiasm in work the dinner was given in the store on one of the long tables in the middle of the room they tacked wrapping paper over the front windows and the turkeys and other good things were brought in the back way from the restaurant on the corner you will perceive that the bee hive was not a fashionable department store with escalators and pompadours it was almost small enough to be called an emporium and you could actually go in there and get waited on and walk out again and always at the thanksgiving dinners mr ramsay oh bother i should have mentioned mr ramsay first of all he is more important than purple or green or even the red cranberry sauce mr ramsay was the head clerk and as far as i am concerned i am for him he never pinched the girls arms when he passed them in dark corners of the store and when he told them stories when business was dull and the girls giggled and said oh pshaw it wasn t g bernard they meant at all besides being a gentleman mr ramsay was queer and original in other ways he was a health crank and believed that people should never eat anything that was good for them he was violently opposed to anybody being comfortable and coming in out of snow storms or wearing overshoes or taking medicine or coddling themselves in any way every one of the ten girls in the store had little pork chop and fried onion dreams every night of becoming mrs ramsay for next year old bachman was going to take him in for a partner and each one of them knew that if she should catch him she would knock those cranky health notions of his sky high before the wedding cake indigestion was over mr ramsay was master of ceremonies at the dinners always they had two italians in to play a violin and harp and had a little dance in the store and here were two dresses being conceived to charm ramsay one purple and the other red of course the other eight girls were going to have dresses too but they didn t count very likely they d wear some shirt waist and black skirt affairs nothing as resplendent as purple or red grace had saved her money too she was going to buy her dress ready made oh what s the use of bothering with a tailor when you ve got a figger it s easy to get a fit the ready made are intended for a perfect figger except i have to have em all taken in at the waist the average figger is so large waisted the night before thanksgiving came maida hurried home keen and bright with the thoughts of the blessed morrow her thoughts were of purple but they were white themselves the joyous enthusiasm of the young for the pleasures that youth must have or wither she knew purple would become her and for the thousandth time she tried to assure herself that it was purple mr ramsay said he liked and not red she was going home first to get the wrapped in a piece of tissue paper in the bottom drawer of her dresser and then she was going to pay schlegel and take the dress home herself grace lived in the same house she occupied the hall room above maida s at home maida found clamor and confusion the landlady s tongue clattering sourly in the halls like a churn dasher dabbing in buttermilk and then grace come down to her room crying with eyes as red as any dress she says i ve got to get out said grace the old beast because i owe her she s put my trunk in the hall and locked the door i can t go anywhere else i haven t got a cent of money you had some yesterday said maida i paid it on my dress said grace i thought she d wait till next week for the rent sniffle sniffle sob sniffle out came out it had to come maida s you blessed darling cried grace now a rainbow instead of sunset i ll pay the mean old thing and then i m going to try on my dress i think it s heavenly come up and look at it i ll pay the money back a dollar a week honest i will thanksgiving the dinner was to be at noon at a quarter to twelve grace switched into maida s room yes she looked charming red was her color maida sat by the window in her old cheviot skirt and blue waist darning a st oh doing fancy work why goodness me ain t you dressed yet shrilled the red one how does it fit in the back don t you think these velvet tabs look awful swell why ain t you dressed maida my dress didn t get finished in time said maida i m not going to the dinner that s too bad why i m awfully sorry maida why don t you put on anything and come along it s just the store folks you know and they won t mind i was set on my purple said maida if i can t have it i won t go at all don t bother about me run along or you ll be late you look awful nice in red at her window maida sat through the long morning and past the time of the dinner at the store in her mind she could hear the girls shrieking over a pull bone could hear old bachman s roar over his own deeply concealed jokes could see the diamonds of fat mrs bachman who came to the store only on thanksgiving days could see mr ramsay moving about alert kindly looking to the comfort of all at four in the afternoon with an expressionless face and a lifeless air she slowly made her way to schlegel s shop and told him she could not pay the due on the dress gott cried schlegel angrily for what do you look so glum take him away he is ready pay me some time haf i not seen you pass mine shop every day in two years if i make clothes is it that i do not know how to read beoples because you will pay me some time when you can take him away he is made goot and if you look bretty in him all right so pay me when you can maida breathed a millionth part of the thanks in her heart and hurried away with her dress as she left the shop a smart dash of rain struck upon her face she smiled and did not feel it ladies who shop in carriages you do not understand girls whose wardrobes are charged to the old man s account you cannot begin to comprehend you could not understand why maida did not feel the cold dash of the thanksgiving rain at five o clock she went out upon the street wearing her purple dress the rain had increased and it beat down upon her in a steady wind blown pour people were scurrying home and to cars with close held umbrellas and tight buttoned raincoats many of them turned their heads to marvel at this beautiful serene happy eyed girl in the purple dress walking through the storm as though she were strolling in a garden under summer skies i say you do not understand it ladies of the full purse and varied wardrobe you do not know what it is to live with a perpetual longing for pretty things to starve eight months in order to bring a purple dress and a holiday together what difference if it rained hailed blew snowed cycloned maida had no umbrella nor overshoes she had her purple dress and she walked abroad let the elements do their worst a starved heart must have one crumb during a year the rain ran down and dripped from her fingers some one turned a corner and blocked her way she looked up into mr ramsay s eyes sparkling with admiration and interest why miss maida said he you look simply magnificent in your new dress i was greatly disappointed not to see you at our dinner and of all the girls i ever knew you show the greatest sense and intelligence there is nothing more healthful and invigorating than braving the weather as you are doing may i walk with you and maida blushed and sneezed the foreign policy of company john byrnes hose cart driver of engine company no was afflicted with what his comrades called japanits byrnes had a war map spread permanently upon a table in the second story of the engine house and he could explain to you at any hour of the day or night the exact positions conditions and intentions of both the russian and japanese armies he had little clusters of pins stuck in the map which represented the opposing forces and these be moved about from day to day in conformity with the war news in the daily papers wherever the japs won a victory john byrnes would shift his pins and then he would execute a war dance of delight and the other firemen would hear him yell go it you blamed little sawed off huckleberry eyed monkey faced hot tamales eat em up you little sleight o hand bow legged bull terriers give em another of them yalu looloos and you ll eat rice in st petersburg talk about your russians say wouldn t they give you a painsky when it comes to a scrapovitch not even on the fair island of nippon was there a more enthusiastic champion of the mikado s men supporters of the russian cause did well to keep clear of engine house no sometimes all thoughts of the japs left john byrnes s head that was when the alarm of fire had sounded and he was strapped in his driver s seat on the swaying cart guilding erebus and joe the finest team in the whole department according to the crew of of all the codes adopted by man for regulating his actions toward his fellow mortals the greatest are these the code of king arthur s knights of the round table the constitution of the united states and the unwritten rules of the new york fire department the round table methods are no longer practicable since the invention of street cars and breach of promise suits and our constitution is being found more and more unconstitutional every day so the code of our firemen must be considered in the lead with the golden rule and jeffries s new punch trying for place and show the constitution says that one man is as good as another but the fire department says he is better this is a too generous theory but the law will not tallow itself to be construed otherwise all of which comes perilously near to being a paradox and commends itself to the attention of the s p c a one of the transatlantic liners dumped out at ellis island a lump of protozoa which was expected to evolve into an american citizen a steward kicked him down the gangway a doctor pounced upon his eyes like a raven seeking for trachoma or ophthalmia he was hustled ashore and ejected into the city in the name of liberty perhaps theoretically thus inoculating against kingocracy with a drop of its own virus this hypodermic injection of europeanism wandered happily into the veins of the city with the broad grin of a pleased child it was not burdened with baggage cares or ambitions its body was lithely built and clothed in a sort of foreign fustian its face was brightly vacant with a small flat nose and was mostly covered by a thick ragged curling beard like the coat of a spaniel in the pocket of the imported thing were a few coins denarii sendi kopecks pfennigs pilasters whatever the financial nomenclature of his unknown country nay have been prattling to himself always broadly grinning pleased by the roar and movement of the barbarous city into which the steamship cut rates had shunted him the alien strayed away from the sea which he hated as far as the district covered by engine company no light as a cork he was kept bobbing along by the human tide the cruelest atom in all the silt of the stream that emptied into the reservoir of liberty while crossing third avenue he slowed his steps enchanted by the thunder of the elevated trains above him and the soothing crash of the wheels on the cobbles and then there was a new delightful chord in the uproar the musical clanging of a gong and a great shining juggernaut belching fire and smoke that people were hurrying to see this beautiful thing entrancing to the eye dashed past and the protoplasmic immigrant stepped into the wake of it with his broad enraptured uncomprehending grin and so stepping stepped into the path of no s flying hose cart with john byrnes gripping with arms of steel the reins over the plunging backs of erebus and joe the unwritten constitutional code of the fireman has no exceptions or amendments it is a simple thing as simple as the rule of three there was the heedless unit in the right of way there was the hose cart and the iron pillar of the elevated railroad john byrnes swung all his weight and muscle on the left rein the team and cart swerved that way and crashed like a torpedo into the pillar the men on the cart went flying like skittles the driver s strap burst the pillar rang with the shock and john byrnes fell on the car track with a broken shoulder twenty feet away while erebus beautiful raven black best loved erebus lay whickering in his harness with a broken leg in consideration for the feelings of engine company no the details will be lightly touched the company does not like to be reminded of that day there was a great crowd and hurry calls were sent in and while the ambulance gong was clearing the way the men of no heard the crack of the s p c a agent s pistol and turned their heads away not daring to look toward erebus again when the firemen got back to the engine house they found that one of them was dragging by the collar the cause of their desolation and grief they set it in the middle of the floor and gathered grimly about it through its whiskers the calamitous object chattered effervescently and waved its hands sounds like a seidlitz powder said mike dowling disgustedly and it makes me sicker than one call that a man that hoss was worth a steamer full of such two legged animals it s a immigrant that s what it is look at the doctor s chalk mark on its coat said reilly the desk man it s just landed it must be a kind of a dago or a hun or one of them finns i guess that s the kind of truck that europe unloads onto us think of a thing like that getting in the way and laying john up in hospital and spoiling the best fire team in the city groaned another fireman it ought to be taken down to the dock and drowned somebody go around and get sloviski suggested the engine driver and let s see what nation is responsible for this conglomeration of hair and head noises sloviski kept a delicatessen store around the corner on third avenue and was reputed to be a linguist one of the men fetched him a fat cringing man with a discursive eye and the odors of many kinds of meats upon him take a whirl at this importation with your jaw breakers sloviski requested mike dowling we can t quite figure out whether he s from the hackensack bottoms or hongkong on the ganges sloviski addressed the stranger in several dialects that ranged in rhythm and cadence from the sounds produced by a tonsilitis gargle to the opening of a can of tomatoes with a pair of scissors the immigrant replied in accents resembling the uncorking of a bottle of ginger ale i have you his name reported sloviski you shall not pronounce it writing of it in paper is better they gave him paper and he wrote demetre svangvsk looks like short hand said the desk man he speaks some language continued the interpreter wiping his forehead of austria and mixed with a little turkish and den he have some magyar words and a polish or two and many like the roumanian but not without talk of one tribe in bessarabia i do not him quite understand would you call him a dago or a polocker or what asked mike frowning at the polyglot description he is a answered sloviski he is a i dink he come from i dink he is a fool he concluded impatient at his linguistic failure and if you pleases i will go back at mine delicatessen whatever he is he s a bird said mike dowling and you want to watch him fly taking by the wing the alien fowl that had fluttered into the nest of liberty mike led him to the door of the engine house and bestowed upon him a kick hearty enough to convey the entire animus of company demetre svangvsk hustled away down the sidewalk turning once to show his ineradicable grin to the aggrieved firemen in three weeks john byrnes was back at his post from the hospital with great gusto he proceeded to bring his war map up to date my money on the japs every time he declared why look at them russians they re nothing but wolves wipe em out i say and the little old jiu jitsu gang are just the cherry blossoms to do the trick and don t you forget it the second day after byrnes s reappearance came demetre svangvsk the unidentified to the engine house with a broader grin than ever he managed to convey the idea that he wished to congratulate the hose cart driver on his recovery and to apologize for having caused the accident this he accomplished by so many extravagant gestures and explosive noises that the company was diverted for half an hour then they kicked him out again and on the next day he came back grinning how or where he lived no one knew and then john byrnes s nine year old son chris who brought him convalescent delicacies from home to eat took a fancy to svangvsk and they allowed him to loaf about the door of the engine house occasionally one afternoon the big drab automobile of the deputy fire commissioner buzzed up to the door of no and the deputy stepped inside for an informal inspection the men kicked svangvsk out a little harder than usual and proudly escorted the deputy around in which everything shone like my lady s mirror the deputy respected the sorrow of the company concerning the loss of erebus and he had come to promise it another mate for joe that would do him credit so they let joe out of his stall and showed the deputy how deserving he was of the finest mate that could be in horsedom while they were circling around joe confabbing chris climbed into the deputy s auto and threw the power full on the men heard a monster puffing and a shriek from the lad and sprang out too late the big auto shot away luckily taking a straight course down the street the boy knew nothing of its machinery he sat clutching the cushions and howling with the power on nothing could have stopped that auto except a brick house and there was nothing for chris to gain by such a stoppage demetre svangvsk was just coming in again with a grin for another kick when chris played his merry little prank while the others sprang for the door demetre sprang for joe he glided upon the horse s bare back like a snake and shouted something at him like the crack of a dozen whips one of the firemen afterward swore that joe answered him back in the same language ten seconds after the auto started the big horse was eating up the asphalt behind it like a strip of macaroni some people two blocks and a half away saw the rescue they said that the auto was nothing but a drab noise with a black speck in the middle of it for chris when a big bay horse with a lizard lying on its back cantered up alongside of it and the lizard reached over and picked the black speck out of the noise only fifteen minutes after svangvsk s last kicking at the hands or rather the feet of engine company no he rode joe back through the door with the boy safe but acutely conscious of the licking he was going to receive svangvsk slipped to the floor leaned his head against joe s and made a noise like a clucking hen joe nodded and whistled loudly through his nostrils putting to shame the knowledge of sloviski of the delicatessen john byrnes walked up to svangvsk who grinned expecting to be kicked byrnes gripped the outlander so strongly by the hand that demetre grinned anyhow conceiving it to be a new form of punishment the heathen rides like a cossack remarked a fireman who had seen a wild west show they re the greatest riders in the world the word seemed to electrify svangvsk he grinned wider than ever yas yas me cossack he spluttered striking his chest cossack repeated john byrnes thoughtfully ain t that a kind of a russian they re one of the russian tribes sure said the desk man who read books between fire alarms just then alderman foley who was on his way home and did not know of the runaway stopped at the door of the engine house and called to byrnes hello there jimmy me boy how s the war coming along japs still got the bear on the trot have they oh i don t know said john byrnes argumentatively them japs haven t got any walkover you wait till kuropatkin gets a good whack at em and they won t be knee high to a puddle ducksky the lost blend since the bar has been blessed by the clergy and cocktails open the dinners of the elect one may speak of the saloon teetotalers need not listen if they choose there is always the slot restaurant where a dime dropped into the cold bouillon aperture will bring forth a dry martini con lantry worked on the sober side of the bar in kenealy s cafe you and i stood one legged like geese on the other side and went into voluntary liquidation with our week s wages opposite danced con clean temperate clear headed polite white jacketed punctual trustworthy young responsible and took our money the saloon whether blessed or cursed stood in one of those little places which are parallelograms instead of streets and inhabited by laundries decayed knickerbocker families and bohemians who have nothing to do with either over the cafe lived kenealy and his family his daughter katherine had eyes of dark irish but why should you be told be content with your geraldine or your eliza ann for con dreamed of her and when she called softly at the foot of the back stairs for the pitcher of beer for dinner his heart went up and down like a milk punch in the shaker orderly and fit are the rules of romance and if you hurl the last shilling of your fortune upon the bar for whiskey the bartender shall take it and marry his boss s daughter and good will grow out of it but not so con for in the presence of woman he was tongue tied and scarlet he who would quell with his eye the sonorous youth whom the claret punch made loquacious or smash with lemon squeezer the obstreperous or hurl gutterward the cantankerous without a wrinkle coming to his white lawn tie when he stood before woman he was voiceless incoherent stuttering buried beneath a hot avalanche of bashfulness and misery what then was he before katherine a trembler with no word to say for himself a stone without blarney the dumbest lover that ever babbled of the weather in the presence of his divinity there came to kenealy s two sunburned men riley and mcquirk they had conference with kenealy and then they took possession of a back room which they filled with bottles and siphons and jugs and druggist s measuring glasses all the appurtenances and liquids of a saloon were there but they dispensed no drinks all day long the two sweltered in there pouring and mixing unknown brews and decoctions from the liquors in their store riley had the education and he figured on reams of paper reducing gallons to ounces and quarts to fluid drams mcquirk a morose man with a red eye dashed each unsuccessful completed mixture into the waste pipes with curses gentle husky and deep they labored heavily and untiringly to achieve some mysterious solution like two alchemists striving to resolve gold from the elements into this back room one evening when his watch was done sauntered con his professional curiosity had been stirred by these occult bartenders at whose bar none drank and who daily drew upon kenealy s store of liquors to follow their consuming and fruitless experiments down the back stairs came katherine with her smile like sunrise on gweebarra bay good evening mr lantry says she and what is the news to day if you please it looks like r rain stammered the shy one backing to the wall it couldn t do better said katherine i m thinking there s nothing the worse off for a little water in the back room riley and mcquirk toiled like bearded witches over their strange compounds from fifty bottles they drew liquids carefully measured after riley s figures and shook the whole together in a great glass vessel then mcquirk would dash it out with gloomy profanity and they would begin again sit down said riley to con and i ll tell you last summer me and tim concludes that an american bar in this nation of nicaragua would pay there was a town on the coast where there s nothing to eat but quinine and nothing to drink but rum the natives and foreigners lay down with chills and get up with fevers and a good mixed drink is nature s remedy for all such tropical inconveniences so we lays in a fine stock of wet goods in new york and bar fixtures and glassware and we sails for that santa palma town on a lime steamer on the way me and tim sees flying fish and plays seven up with the captain and steward and already begins to feel like the high ball kings of the tropics of capricorn when we gets in five hours of the country that we was going to introduce to long drinks and short change the captain calls us over to the starboard binnacle and recollects a few things i forgot to tell you boys says he that nicaragua slapped an import duty of per cent ad valorem on all bottled goods last month the president took a bottle of cincinnati hair tonic by mistake for tobasco sauce and he s getting even barrelled goods is free sorry you didn t mention it sooner says we and we bought two forty two gallon casks from the captain and opened every bottle we had and dumped the stuff all together in the casks that per cent would have ruined us so we took the chances on making that cocktail rather than throw the stud away well when we landed we tapped one of the barrels the mixture was something heartrending it was the color of a plate of bowery pea soup and it tasted like one of those coffee substitutes your aunt makes you take for the heart trouble you get by picking losers we gave a nigger four fingers of it to try it and he lay under a cocoanut tree three days beating the sand with his heels and refused to sign a testimonial but the other barrel say bartender did you ever put on a straw hat with a yellow band around it and go up in a balloon with a pretty girl with in your pocket all at the same time that s what thirty drops of it would make you feel like with two fingers of it inside you you would bury your face in your hands and cry because there wasn t anything more worth while around for you to lick than little jim jeffries yes sir the stuff in that second barrel was distilled elixir of battle money and high life it was the color of gold and as clear as glass and it shone after dark like the sunshine was still in it a thousand years from now you ll get a drink like that across the bar well we started up business with that one line of drinks and it was enough the piebald gentry of that country stuck to it like a hive of bees if that barrel had lasted that country would have become the greatest on earth when we opened up of mornings we had a line of generals and colonels and ex presidents and revolutionists a block long waiting to be served we started in at cents silver a drink the last ten gallons went easy at a gulp it was wonderful stuff it gave a man courage and ambition and nerve to do anything at the same time he didn t care whether his money was tainted or fresh from the ice trust when that barrel was half gone nicaragua had repudiated the national debt removed the duty on cigarettes and was about to declare war on the united states and england twas by accident we discovered this king of drinks and twill be by good luck if we strike it again for ten months we ve been trying small lots at a time we ve mixed barrels of all the harmful ingredients known to the profession of drinking ye could have stocked ten bars with the whiskies brandies cordials bitters gins and wines me and tim have wasted a glorious drink like that to be denied to the world tis a sorrow and a loss of money the united states as a nation would welcome a drink of that sort and pay for it all the while mcquirk lead been carefully measuring and pouring together small quantities of various spirits as riley called them from his latest pencilled prescription the completed mixture was of a vile mottled chocolate color mcquirk tasted it and hurled it with appropriate epithets into the waste sink tis a strange story even if true said con i ll be going now along to my supper take a drink said riley we ve all kinds except the lost blend i never drink said con anything stronger than water i am just after meeting miss katherine by the stairs she said a true word there s not anything says she but is better off for a little water when con had left them riley almost felled mcquirk by a blow on the back did ye hear that he shouted two fools are we the six dozen bottles of pollinaris we had on the slip ye opened them yourself which barrel did ye pour them in which barrel ye mudhead i mind said mcquirk slowly twas in the second barrel we opened i mind the blue piece of paper pasted on the side of it we ve got it now cried riley twas that we lacked tis the water that does the trick everything else we had right hurry man and get two bottles of pollinaris from the bar while i figure out the proportionments with me pencil an hour later con strolled down the sidewalk toward kenealy s cafe thus faithful employees haunt during their recreation hours the vicinity where they labor drawn by some mysterious attraction a police patrol wagon stood at the side door three able cops were half carrying half hustling riley and mcquirk up its rear steps the eyes and faces of each bore the bruises and cuts of sanguinary and assiduous conflict yet they whooped with strange joy and directed upon the police the feeble remnants of their pugnacious madness began fighting each other in the back room explained kenealy to con and singing that was worse smashed everything pretty much up but they re good men they ll pay for everything trying to invent some new kind of cocktail they was i ll see they come out all right in the morning con sauntered into the back room to view the battlefield as he went through the hall katherine was just coming down the stairs good evening again mr lantry said she and is there no news from the weather yet still threatens r rain said con slipping past with red in his smooth pale cheek riley and mcquirk had indeed waged a great and friendly battle broken bottles and glasses were everywhere the room was full of alcohol fumes the floor was variegated with spirituous puddles on the table stood a ounce glass graduated measure in the bottom of it were two tablespoonfuls of liquid a bright golden liquid that seemed to hold the sunshine a prisoner in its auriferous depths con smelled it he tasted it he drank it as he returned through the hall katherine was just going up the stairs no news yet mr lantry she asked with her teasing laugh con lifted her clear from the floor and held her there the news is he said that we re to be married put me down sir she cried indignantly or i will oh con where oh wherever did you get the nerve to say it a harlem tragedy harlem mrs fink had dropped into mrs cassidy s flat one flight below ain t it a beaut said mrs cassidy she turned her face proudly for her friend mrs fink to see one eye was nearly closed with a great greenish purple bruise around it her lip was cut and bleeding a little and there were red finger marks on each side of her neck my husband wouldn t ever think of doing that to me said mrs fink concealing her envy i wouldn t have a man declared mrs cassidy that didn t beat me up at least once a week shows he thinks something of you say but that last dose jack gave me wasn t no homeopathic one i can see stars yet but he ll be the sweetest man in town for the rest of the week to make up for it this eye is good for theater tickets and a silk shirt waist at the very least i should hope said mrs fink assuming complacency that mr fink is too much of a gentleman ever to raise his hand against me oh go on maggie said mrs cassidy laughing and applying witch hazel you re only jealous your old man is too frapped and slow to ever give you a punch he just sits down and practises physical culture with a newspaper when he comes home now ain t that the truth mr fink certainly peruses of the papers when he comes home acknowledged mrs fink with a toss of her head but he certainly don t ever make no steve o donnell out of me just to amuse himself that s a sure thing mrs cassidy laughed the contented laugh of the guarded and happy matron with the air of cornelia exhibiting her jewels she drew down the collar of her kimono and revealed another treasured bruise maroon colored edged with olive and orange a bruise now nearly well but still to memory dear mrs fink capitulated the formal light in her eye softened to envious admiration she and mrs cassidy had been chums in the downtown paper box factory before they had married one year before now she and her man occupied the flat above mame and her man therefore she could not put on airs with mame don t it hurt when he soaks you asked mrs fink curiously hurt mrs cassidy gave a soprano scream of delight well say did you ever have a brick house fall on you well that s just the way it feels just like when they re digging you out of the ruins jack s got a left that spells two matinees and a new pair of oxfords and his right well it takes a trip to coney and six pairs of openwork silk lisle threads to make that good but what does he beat you for inquired mrs fink with wide open eyes silly said mrs cassidy indulgently why because he s full it s generally on saturday nights but what cause do you give him persisted the seeker after knowledge why didn t i marry him jack comes in tanked up and i m here ain t i who else has he got a right to beat i d just like to catch him once beating anybody else sometimes it s because supper ain t ready and sometimes it s because it is jack ain t particular about causes he just lushes till he remembers he s married and then he makes for home and does me up saturday nights i just move the furniture with sharp corners out of the way so i won t cut my head when he gets his work in he s got a left swing that jars you sometimes i take the count in the first round but when i feel like having a good time during the week or want some new rags i come up again for more punishment that s what i done last night jack knows i ve been wanting a black silk waist for a month and i didn t think just one black eye would bring it tell you what mag i ll bet you the ice cream he brings it to night mrs fink was thinking deeply my mart she said never hit me a lick in his life it s just like you said mame he comes in grouchy and ain t got a word to say he never takes me out anywhere he s a chair warmer at home for fair he buys me things but he looks so glum about it that i never appreciate em mrs cassidy slipped an arm around her chum you poor thing she said but everybody can t have a husband like jack marriage wouldn t be no failure if they was all like him these discontented wives you hear about what they need is a man to come home and kick their slats in once a week and then make it up in kisses and chocolate creams that d give em some interest in life what i want is a masterful man that slugs you when he s jagged and hugs you when he ain t jagged preserve me from the man that ain t got the sand to do neither mrs fink sighed the hallways were suddenly filled with sound the door flew open at the kick of mr cassidy his arms were occupied with bundles mame flew and hung about his neck her sound eye sparkled with the love light that shines in the eye of the maori maid when she recovers consciousness in the hut of the wooer who has stunned and dragged her there hello old girl shouted mr cassidy he shed his bundles and lifted her off her feet in a mighty hug i got tickets for barnum bailey s and if you ll bust the string of one of them bundles i guess you ll find that silk waist why good evening mrs fink i didn t see you at first how s old mart coming along he s very well mr cassidy thanks said mrs fink i must be going along up now mart ll be home for supper soon i ll bring you down that pattern you wanted to morrow mame mrs fink went up to her flat and had a little cry it was a meaningless cry the kind of cry that only a woman knows about a cry from no particular cause altogether an absurd cry the most transient and the most hopeless cry in the repertory of grief why had martin never thrashed her he was as big and strong as jack cassidy did he not care for her at all he never quarrelled he came home and lounged about silent glum idle he was a fairly good provider but he ignored the spices of life mrs fink s ship of dreams was becalmed her captain ranged between plum duff and his hammock if only he would shiver his timbers or stamp his foot on the quarter deck now and then and she had thought to sail so merrily touching at ports in the delectable isles but now to vary the figure she was ready to throw up the sponge tired out without a scratch to show for all those tame rounds with her sparring partner for one moment she almost hated mame mame with her cuts and bruises her salve of presents and kisses her stormy voyage with her fighting brutal loving mate mr fink came home at he was permeated with the curse of domesticity beyond the portals of his cozy home he cared not to roam to roam he was the man who had caught the street car the anaconda that had swallowed its prey the tree that lay as it had fallen like the supper mart asked mrs fink who had striven over it m m m yep grunted mr fink after supper he gathered his newspapers to read he sat in his stocking feet arise some new dante and sing me the befitting corner of perdition for the man who sitteth in the house in his stockinged feet sisters of patience who by reason of ties or duty have endured it in silk yarn cotton lisle thread or woollen does not the new canto belong the next day was labor day the occupations of mr cassidy and mr fink ceased for one passage of the sun labor triumphant would parade and otherwise disport itself mrs fink took mrs cassidy s pattern down early maine had on her new silk waist even her damaged eye managed to emit a holiday gleam jack was fruitfully penitent and there was a hilarious scheme for the day afoot with parks and picnics and pilsener in it a rising indignant jealousy seized mrs fink as she returned to her flat above oh happy mame with her bruises and her quick following balm but was mame to have a monopoly of happiness surely martin fink was as good a man as jack cassidy was his wife to go always unbelabored and uncaressed a sudden brilliant breathless idea came to mrs fink she would show mame that there were husbands as able to use their fists and perhaps to be as tender afterward as any jack the holiday promised to be a nominal one with the finks mrs fink had the stationary washtubs in the kitchen filled with a two weeks wash that had been soaking overnight mr fink sat in his stockinged feet reading a newspaper thus labor day presaged to speed jealousy surged high in mrs fink s heart and higher still surged an audacious resolve if her man would not strike her if he would not so far prove his manhood his prerogative and his interest in conjugal affairs he must be prompted to his duty mr fink lit his pipe and peacefully rubbed an ankle with a stockinged toe he reposed in the state of matrimony like a lump of unblended suet in a pudding this was his level elysium to sit at ease vicariously girdling the world in print amid the wifely splashing of suds and the agreeable smells of breakfast dishes departed and dinner ones to come many ideas were far from his mind but the furthest one was the thought of beating his wife mrs fink turned on the hot water and set the washboards in the suds up from the flat below came the gay laugh of mrs cassidy it sounded like a taunt a flaunting of her own happiness in the face of the unslugged bride above now was mrs fink s time suddenly she turned like a fury upon the man reading you lazy loafer she cried must i work my arms off washing and toiling for the ugly likes of you are you a man or are you a kitchen hound mr fink dropped his paper motionless from surprise she feared that he would not strike that the provocation had been insufficient she leaped at him and struck him fiercely in the face with her clenched hand in that instant she felt a thrill of love for hire such as she had not felt for many a day rise up martin fink and come into your kingdom oh she must feel the weight of his hand now just to show that he cared just to show that he cared mr fink sprang to his feet maggie caught him again on the jaw with a wide swing of her other hand she closed her eyes in that fearful blissful moment before his blow should come she whispered his name to herself she leaned to the expected shock hungry for it in the flat below mr cassidy with a shamed and contrite face was powdering mame s eye in preparation for their junket from the flat above came the sound of a woman s voice high raised a bumping a stumbling and a shufing a chair overturned unmistakable sounds of domestic conflict mart and mag scrapping postulated mr cassidy didn t know they ever indulged shall i trot up and see if they need a sponge holder one of mrs cassidy s eyes sparkled like a diamond the other twinkled at least like paste oh oh she said softly and without apparent meaning in the feminine ejaculatory manner i wonder if wonder if wait jack till i go up and see up the stairs she sped as her foot struck the hallway above out from the kitchen door of her flat wildly flounced mrs fink oh maggie cried mrs cassidy in a delighted whisper did he oh did he mrs fink ran and laid her face upon her chum s shoulder and sobbed hopelessly mrs cassidy took maggie s face between her hands and lifted it gently tear stained it was flushing and paling but its velvety pink and white becomingly freckled surface was unscratched unbruised unmarred by the recreant fist of mr fink tell me maggie pleaded mame or i ll go in there and find out what was it did he hurt you what did he do mrs fink s face went down again despairingly on the bosom of her friend for god s sake don t open that door mame she sobbed and don t ever tell nobody keep it under your hat he he never touched me and he s oh gawd he s washin the clothes he s washin the clothes the guilty party a red haired unshaven untidy man sat in a rocking chair by a window he had just lighted a pipe and was puffing blue clouds with great satisfaction he had removed his shoes and donned a pair of blue faded carpet slippers with the morbid thirst of the confirmed daily news drinker he awkwardly folded back the pages of an evening paper eagerly gulping down the strong black headlines to be followed as a chaser by the milder details of the smaller type in an adjoining room a woman was cooking supper odors from strong bacon and boiling coffee contended against the cut plug fumes from the vespertine pipe outside was one of those crowded streets of the east side in which as twilight falls satan sets up his recruiting office a mighty host of children danced and ran and played in the street some in rags some in clean white and beribboned some wild and restless as young hawks some gentle faced and shrinking some shrieking rude and sinful words some listening awed but soon grown familiar to embrace here were the children playing in the corridors of the house of sin above the playground forever hovered a great bird the bird was known to humorists as the stork but the people of chrystie street were better ornithologists they called it a vulture a little girl of twelve came up timidly to the man reading and resting by the window and said papa won t you play a game of checkers with me if you aren t too tired the red haired unshaven untidy man sitting shoeless by the window answered with a frown checkers no i won t can t a man who works hard all day have a little rest when he comes home why don t you go out and play with the other kids on the sidewalk the woman who was cooking came to the door john she said i don t like for lizzie to play in the street they learn too much there that ain t good for em she s been in the house all day long it seems that you might give up a little of your time to amuse her when you come home let her go out and play like the rest of em if she wants to be amused said the red haired unshaven untidy man and don t bother me you re on said kid mullaly fifty dollars to i take annie to the dance put up the kid s black eyes were snapping with the fire of the baited and challenged he drew out his roll and slapped five tens upon the bar the three or four young fellows who were thus taken more slowly produced their stake the bartender ex officio stakeholder took the money laboriously wrapped it recorded the bet with an inch long pencil and stuffed the whole into a corner of the cash register and oh what ll be done to you ll be a plenty said a bettor with anticipatory glee that s my lookout said the kid sternly fill em up all around mike after the round burke the kid s sponge sponge holder pal mentor and grand vizier drew him out to the bootblack stand at the saloon corner where all the official and important matters of the small hours social club were settled as tony polished the light tan shoes of the club s president and secretary for the fifth time that day burke spake words of wisdom to his chief cut that blond out kid was his advice or there ll be trouble what do you want to throw down that girl of yours for you ll never find one that ll freeze to you like liz has she s worth a hallful of annies i m no annie admirer said the kid dropping a cigarette ash on his polished toe and wiping it off on tony s shoulder but i want to teach liz a lesson she thinks i belong to her she s been bragging that i daren t speak to another girl liz is all right in some ways she s drinking a little too much lately and she uses language that a lady oughtn t you re engaged ain t you asked burke sure we ll get married next year maybe i saw you make her drink her first glass of beer said burke that was two years ago when she used to came down to the corner of chrystie bare headed to meet you after supper she was a quiet sort of a kid then and couldn t speak without blushing she s a little spitfire sometimes now said the kid i hate jealousy that s why i m going to the dance with annie it ll teach her some sense well you better look a little out were burke s last words if liz was my girl and i was to sneak out to a dance coupled up with an annie i d want a suit of chain armor on under my gladsome rags all right through the land of the stork vulture wandered liz her black eyes searched the passing crowds fierily but vaguely now and then she hummed bars of foolish little songs between times she set her small white teeth together and spake crisp words that the east side has added to language liz s skirt was green silk her waist was a large brown and pink plaid well fitting and not without style she wore a cluster ring of huge imitation rubies and a locket that banged her knees at the bottom of a silver chain her shoes were run down over twisted high heels and were strangers to polish her hat would scarcely have passed into a flour barrel the family entrance of the blue jay cafe received her at a table she sat and punched the button with the air of milady ringing for her carriage the waiter came with his large chinned low voiced manner of respectful familiarity liz smoothed her silken skirt with a satisfied wriggle she made the most of it here she could order and be waited upon it was all that her world offered her of the prerogative of woman whiskey tommy she said as her sisters further uptown murmur champagne james sure miss lizzie what ll the chaser be seltzer and say tommy has the kid been around to day why no miss lizzie i haven t saw him to day fluently came the miss lizzie for the kid was known to be one who required rigid upholdment of the dignity of his fiancee i m lookin for m said liz after the chaser had sputtered under her nose it s got to me that he says he ll take annie karlson to the dance let him the pink eyed white rat i m lookin for m you know me tommy two years me and the kid s been engaged look at that ring five hundred he said it cost let him take her to the dance what ll i do i ll cut his heart out another whiskey tommy i wouldn t listen to no such reports miss lizzie said the waiter smoothly from the narrow opening above his chin kid mullaly s not the guy to throw a lady like you down seltzer on the side two years repeated liz softening a little to sentiment under the magic of the distiller s art i always used to play out on the street of evenin s cause there was nothin doin for me at home for a long time i just sat on doorsteps and looked at the lights and the people goin by and then the kid came along one evenin and sized me up and i was mashed on the spot for fair the first drink he made me take i cried all night at home and got a lickin for makin a noise and now say tommy you ever see this annie karlson if it wasn t for peroxide the chloroform limit would have put her out long ago oh i m lookin for m you tell the kid if he comes in me i ll cut his heart out leave it to me another whiskey tommy a little unsteadily but with watchful and brilliant eyes liz walked up the avenue on the doorstep of a brick tenement a curly haired child sat puzzling over the convolutions of a tangled string liz flopped down beside her with a crooked shifting smile on her flushed face but her eyes had grown clear and artless of a sudden let me show you how to make a cat s cradle kid she said tucking her green silk skirt under her rusty shoes and while they sat there the lights were being turned on for the dance in the hall of the small hours social club it was the bi monthly dance a dress affair in which the members took great pride and bestirred themselves huskily to further and adorn at o clock the president kid mullaly paced upon the floor with a lady on his arm as the loreley s was her hair golden her yes was softened to a yah but its quality of assent was patent to the most milesian ears she stepped upon her own train and blushed and she smiled into the eyes of kid mullaly and then as the two stood in the middle of the waxed floor the thing happened to prevent which many lamps are burning nightly in many studies and libraries out from the circle of spectators in the hall leaped fate in a green silk skirt under the nom de guerre of liz her eyes were hard and blacker than jet she did not scream or waver most unwomanly she cried out one oath the kid s own favorite oath and in his own deep voice and then while the small hours social club went frantically to pieces she made good her boast to tommy the waiter made good as far as the length of her knife blade and the strength of her arm permitted and next came the primal instinct of self preservation or was it self annihilation the instinct that society has grafted on the natural branch liz ran out and down the street swift and true as a woodcock flying through a grove of saplings at dusk and then followed the big city s biggest shame its most ancient and rotten surviving canker its pollution and disgrace its blight and perversion its forever infamy and guilt fostered unreproved and cherished handed down from a long ago century of the basest barbarity the hue and cry nowhere but in the big cities does it survive and here most of all where the ultimate perfection of culture citizenship and alleged superiority joins bawling in the chase they pursued a shrieking mob of fathers mothers lovers and maidens howling yelling calling whistling crying for blood well may the wolf in the big city stand outside the door well may his heart the gentler falter at the siege knowing her way and hungry for her surcease she darted down the familiar ways until at last her feet struck the dull solidity of the rotting pier and then it was but a few more panting steps and good mother east river took liz to her bosom soothed her muddily taut quickly and settled in five minutes the problem that keeps lights burning o nights in thousands of pastorates and colleges it s mighty funny what kind of dreams one has sometimes poets call them visions but a vision is only a dream in blank verse i dreamed the rest of this story i thought i was in the next world i don t know how i got there i suppose i had been riding on the ninth avenue elevated or taking patent medicine or trying to pull jim jeffries s nose or doing some such little injudicious stunt but anyhow there i was and there was a great crowd of us outside the courtroom where the judgments were going on and every now and then a very beautiful and imposing court officer angel would come outside the door and call another case while i was considering my own worldly sins and wondering whether there would be any use of my trying to prove an alibi by claiming that i lived in new jersey the bailiff angel came to the door and sang out case no up stepped a plain clothes man there were lots of em there dressed exactly like preachers and hustling us spirits around just like cops do on earth and by the arm he dragged whom do you think why liz the court officer took her inside and closed the door i went up to mr fly cop and inquired about the case a very sad one says he laying the points of his manicured fingers together an utterly incorrigible girl i am special terrestrial officer the reverend jones the case was assigned to me the girl murdered her fiance and committed suicide she had no defense my report to the court relates the facts in detail all of which are substantiated by reliable witnesses the wages of sin is death praise the lord the court officer opened the door and stepped out poor girl said special terrestrial officer the reverend jones with a tear in his eye it was one of the saddest cases that i ever met with of course she was discharged said the court officer come here jonesy first thing you know you ll be switched to the pot pie squad how would you like to be on the missionary force in the south sea islands hey now you quit making these false arrests or you ll be transferred see the guilty party you ve not to look for in this case is a red haired unshaven untidy man sitting by the window reading in his stocking feet while his children play in the streets get a move on you now wasn t that a silly dream according to their lights somewhere in the depths of the big city where the unquiet dregs are forever being shaken together young murray and the captain had met and become friends both were at the lowest ebb possible to their fortunes both had fallen from at least an intermediate heaven of respectability and importance and both were typical products of the monstrous and peculiar social curriculum of their overweening and bumptious civic alma mater the captain was no longer a captain one of those sudden moral cataclysms that sometimes sweep the city had hurled him from a high and profitable position in the police department ripping off his badge and buttons and washing into the hands of his lawyers the solid pieces of real estate that his frugality had enabled him to accumulate the passing of the flood left him low and dry one month after his dishabilitation a saloon keeper plucked him by the neck from his free lunch counter as a tabby plucks a strange kitten from her nest and cast him asphaltward this seems low enough but after that he acquired a pair of cloth top button congress gaiters and wrote complaining letters to the newspapers and then he fought the attendant at the municipal lodging house who tried to give him a bath when murray first saw him he was holding the hand of an italian woman who sold apples and garlic on essex street and quoting the words of a song book ballad murray s fall had been more luciferian if less spectacular all the pretty tiny little kickshaws of gotham had once been his the megaphone man roars out at you to observe the house of his uncle on a grand and revered avenue but there had been an awful row about something and the prince had been escorted to the door by the butler which in said avenue is equivalent to the impact of the avuncular shoe a weak prince hal without inheritance or sword he drifted downward to meet his humorless falstaff and to pick the crusts of the streets with him one evening they sat on a bench in a little downtown park the great bulk of the captain which starvation seemed to increase drawing irony instead of pity to his petitions for aid was heaped against the arm of the bench in a shapeless mass his red face spotted by tufts of vermilion week old whiskers and topped by a sagging white straw hat looked in the gloom like one of those structures that you may observe in a dark third avenue window challenging your imagination to say whether it be something recent in the way of ladies hats or a strawberry shortcake a tight drawn belt last relic of his official spruceness made a deep furrow in his circumference the captain s shoes were buttonless in a smothered bass he cursed his star of ill luck murray at his side was shrunk into his dingy and ragged suit of blue serge his hat was pulled low he sat quiet and a little indistinct like some ghost that had been dispossessed i m hungry growled the captain by the top sirloin of the bull of bashan i m starving to death right now i could eat a bowery restaurant clear through to the stovepipe in the alley can t you think of nothing murray you sit there with your shoulders scrunched up giving an irritation of reginald vanderbilt driving his coach what good are them airs doing you now think of some place we can get something to chew you forget my dear captain said murray without moving that our last attempt at dining was at my suggestion you bet it was groaned the captain you bet your life it was have you got any more like that to make hey i admit we failed sighed murray i was sure malone would be good for one more free lunch after the way he talked baseball with me the last time i spent a nickel in his establishment i had this hand said the captain extending the unfortunate member i had this hand on the drum stick of a turkey and two sardine sandwiches when them waiters grabbed us i was within two inches of the olives said murray stuffed olives i haven t tasted one in a year what ll we do grumbled the captain we can t starve can t we said murray quietly i m glad to hear that i was afraid we could you wait here said the captain rising heavily and puffily to his feet i m going to try to make one more turn you stay here till i come back murray i won t be over half an hour if i turn the trick i ll come back flush he made some elephantine attempts at smartening his appearance he gave his fiery mustache a heavenward twist he dragged into sight a pair of black edged cuffs deepened the crease in his middle by tightening his belt another hole and set off jaunty as a zoo rhinoceros across the south end of the park when he was out of sight murray also left the park hurrying swiftly eastward he stopped at a building whose steps were flanked by two green lights a police captain named maroney he said to the desk sergeant was dismissed from the force after being tried under charges three years ago i believe sentence was suspended is this man wanted now by the police why are ye asking inquired the sergeant with a frown i thought there might be a reward standing explained murray easily i know the man well he seems to be keeping himself pretty shady at present i could lay my hands on him at any time if there should be a reward there s no reward interrupted the sergeant shortly the man s not wanted and neither are ye so get out ye are frindly with um and ye would be selling um out with ye quick or i ll give ye a start murray gazed at the officer with serene and virtuous dignity i would be simply doing my duty as a citizen and gentleman he said severely if i could assist the law in laying hold of one of its ofenders murray hurried back to the bench in the park he folded his arms and shrank within his clothes to his ghost like presentment ten minutes afterward the captain arrived at the rendezvous windy and thunderous as a clog day in kansas his collar had been torn away his straw hat had been twisted and battered his shirt with ox blood stripes split to the waist and from head to knee he was drenched with some vile and ignoble greasy fluid that loudly proclaimed to the nose its component leaven of garlic and kitchen stuff for heaven s sake captain sniffed murray i doubt that i would have waited for you if i had suspected you were so desperate as to resort to swill barrels i cheese it said the captain harshly i m not hogging it yet it s all on the outside i went around on essex and proposed marriage to that catrina that s got the fruit shop there now that business could be built up she s a peach as far as a dago could be i thought i had that senoreena mashed sure last week but look what she done to me i guess i got too fresh well there s another scheme queered you don t mean to say said murray with infinite contempt that you would have married that woman to help yourself out of your disgraceful troubles me said the captain i d marry the empress of china for one bowl of chop suey i d commit murder for a plate of beef stew i d steal a wafer from a waif i d be a mormon for a bowl of chowder i think said murray resting his head on his hands that i would play judas for the price of one drink of whiskey for thirty pieces of silver i would oh come now exclaimed the captain in dismay you wouldn t do that murray i always thought that kike s squeal on his boss was about the lowest down play that ever happened a man that gives his friend away is worse than a pirate through the park stepped a large man scanning the benches where the electric light fell is that you mac he said halting before the derelicts his diamond stickpin dazzled his diamond studded fob chain assisted he was big and smooth and well fed yes i see it s you he continued they told me at mike s that i might find you over here let me see you a few minutes mac the captain lifted himself with a grunt of alacrity if charlie finnegan had come down in the bottomless pit to seek him there must be something doing charlie guided him by an arm into a patch of shadow you know mac he said they re trying inspector pickering on graft charges he was my inspector said the captain o shea wants the job went on finnegan he must have it it s for the good of the organization pickering must go under your testimony will do it he was your man higher up when you were on the force his share of the boodle passed through your hands you must go on the stand and testify against him he was began the captain wait a minute said finnegan a bundle of yellowish stuff came out of his inside pocket five hundred dollars in it for you two fifty on the spot and the rest he was my friend i say finished the captain i ll see you and the gang and the city and the party in the flames of hades before i ll take the stand against dan pickering i m down and out but i m no traitor to a man that s been my friend the captain s voice rose and boomed like a split trombone get out of this park charlie finnegan where us thieves and tramps and boozers are your betters and take your dirty money with you finnegan drifted out by another walk the captain turned to his seat i couldn t avoid hearing said murray drearily i think you are the biggest fool i ever saw what would you have done asked the captain nailed pickering to the cross said murray sonny said the captain huskily and without heat you and me are different new york is divided into two parts above forty second street and below fourteenth you come from the other part we both act according to our lights an illuminated clock above the trees retailed the information that it lacked the half hour of twelve both men rose from the bench and moved away together as if seized by the same idea they left the park struck through a narrow cross street and came into broadway at this hour as dark echoing and de peopled as a byway in pompeii northward they turned and a policeman who glanced at their unkempt and slinking figures withheld the attention and suspicion that he would have granted them at any other hour and place for on every street in that part of the city other unkempt and slinking figures were shuffling and hurrying toward a converging point a point that is marked by no monument save that groove on the pavement worn by tens of thousands of waiting feet at ninth street a tall man wearing an opera hat alighted from a broadway car and turned his face westward but he saw murray pounced upon him and dragged him under a street light the captain lumbered slowly to the corner like a wounded bear and waited growling jerry cried the hatted one how fortunate i was to begin a search for you to morrow the old gentleman has capitulated you re to be restored to favor congratulate you come to the office in the morning and get all the money you want i ve liberal instructions in that respect and the little matrimonial arrangement said murray with his head turned sidewise why er well of course your uncle under stands expects that the engagement between you and miss vanderhurst shall be good night said murray moving away you madman cried the other catching his arm would you give up two millions on account of did you ever see her nose old man asked murray solemnly but listen to reason jerry miss vanderhurst is an heiress and did you ever see it yes i admit that her nose isn t good night said murray my friend is waiting for me i am quoting him when i authorize you to report that there is nothing doing good night a wriggling line of waiting men extended from a door in tenth street far up broadway on the outer edge of the pavement the captain and murray fell in at the tail of the quivering millipede twenty feet longer than it was last night said murray looking up at his measuring angle of grace church half an hour growled the captain before we get our punk the city clocks began to strike the bread line moved forward slowly its leathern feet sliding on the stones with the sound of a hissing serpent as they who had lived according to their lights closed up in the rear a midsummer knight s dream the knights are dead their swords are rust except a few who haze to hust le all the time to raise the dust dear reader it was summertime the sun glared down upon the city with pitiless ferocity it is difficult for the sun to be ferocious and exhibit compunction simultaneously the heat was oh bother thermometers who cares for standard measures anyhow it was so hot that the roof gardens put on so many extra waiters that you could hope to get your gin fizz now as soon as all the other people got theirs the hospitals were putting in extra cots for bystanders for when little woolly dogs loll their tongues out and say woof woof at the fleas that bite em and nervous old black bombazine ladies screech mad dog and policemen begin to shoot somebody is going to get hurt the man from pompton n j who always wears an overcoat in july had turned up in a broadway hotel drinking hot scotches and enjoying his annual ray from the calcium philanthropists were petitioning the legislature to pass a bill requiring builders to make tenement fire escapes more commodious so that families might die all together of the heat instead of one or two at a time so many men were telling you about the number of baths they took each day that you wondered how they got along after the real lessee of the apartment came back to town and thanked em for taking such good care of it the young man who called loudly for cold beef and beer in the restaurant protesting that roast pullet and burgundy was really too heavy for such weather blushed when he met your eye for you had heard him all winter calling in modest tones for the same ascetic viands soup pocketbooks shirt waists actors and baseball excuses grew thinner yes it was summertime a man stood at thirty fourth street waiting for a downtown car a man of forty gray haired pink faced keen nervous plainly dressed with a harassed look around the eyes he wiped his forehead and laughed loudly when a fat man with an outing look stopped and spoke with him no siree he shouted with defiance and scorn none of your old mosquito haunted swamps and skyscraper mountains without elevators for me when i want to get away from hot weather i know how to do it new york sir is the finest summer resort in the country keep in the shade and watch your diet and don t get too far away from an electric fan talk about your adirondacks and your catskills there s more solid comfort in the borough of manhattan than in all the rest of the country together no siree no tramping up perpendicular cliffs and being waked up at in the morning by a million flies and eating canned goods straight from the city for me little old new york will take a few select summer boarders comforts and conveniences of homes that s the ad that i answer every time you need a vacation said the fat man looking closely at the other you haven t been away from town in years better come with me for two weeks anyhow the trout in the beaverkill are jumping at anything now that looks like a fly harding writes me that he landed a three pound brown last week nonsense cried the other man go ahead if you like and boggle around in rubber boots wearing yourself out trying to catch fish when i want one i go to a cool restaurant and order it i laugh at you fellows whenever i think of you hustling around in the heat in the country thinking you are having a good time for me father knickerbocker s little improved farm with the big shady lane running through the middle of it the fat man sighed over his friend and went his way the man who thought new york was the greatest summer resort in the country boarded a car and went buzzing down to his office on the way he threw away his newspaper and looked up at a ragged patch of sky above the housetops three pounds he muttered absently and harding isn t a liar i believe if i could but it s impossible they ve got to have another month another month at least in his office the upholder of urban midsummer joys dived headforemost into the swimming pool of business adkins his clerk came and added a spray of letters memoranda and telegrams at o clock in the afternoon the busy man leaned back in his office chair put his feet on the desk and mused aloud i wonder what kind of bait harding used she was all in white that day and thereby compton lost a bet to gaines compton had wagered she would wear light blue for she knew that was his favorite color and compton was a millionaire s son and that almost laid him open to the charge of betting on a sure thing but white was her choice and gaines held up his head with twenty five s lordly air the little summer hotel in the mountains had a lively crowd that year there were two or three young college men and a couple of artists and a young naval officer on one side on the other there were enough beauties among the young ladies for the correspondent of a society paper to refer to them as a bevy but the moon among the stars was mary sewell each one of the young men greatly desired to arrange matters so that he could pay her millinery bills and fix the furnace and have her do away with the sewell part of her name forever those who could stay only a week or two went away hinting at pistols and blighted hearts but compton stayed like the mountains themselves for he could afford it and gaines stayed because he was a fighter and wasn t afraid of millionaire s sons and well he adored the country what do you think miss mary he said once i knew a duffer in new york who claimed to like it in the summer time said you could keep cooler there than you could in the woods wasn t he an awful silly i don t think i could breathe on broadway after the st of june mamma was thinking of going back week after next said miss mary with a lovely frown but when you think of it said gaines there are lots of jolly places in town in the summer the roof gardens you know and the er the roof gardens deepest blue was the lake that day the day when they had the mock tournament and the men rode clumsy farm horses around in a glade in the woods and caught curtain rings on the end of a lance such fun cool and dry as the finest wine came the breath of the shadowed forest the valley below was a vision seen through an opal haze a white mist from hidden falls blurred the green of a hand s breadth of tree tops half way down the gorge youth made merry hand in hand with young summer nothing on broadway like that the villagers gathered to see the city folks pursue their mad drollery the woods rang with the laughter of pixies and naiads and sprites gaines caught most of the rings his was the privilege to crown the queen of the tournament he was the conquering knight as far as the rings went on his arm he wore a white scarf compton wore light blue she had declared her preference for blue but she wore white that day gaines looked about for the queen to crown her he heard her merry laugh as if from the clouds she had slipped away and climbed chimney rock a little granite bluff and stood there a white fairy among the laurels fifty feet above their heads instantly he and compton accepted the implied challenge the bluff was easily mounted at the rear but the front offered small hold to hand or foot each man quickly selected his route and began to climb a crevice a bush a slight projection a vine or tree branch all of these were aids that counted in the race it was all foolery there was no stake but there was youth in it cross reader and light hearts and something else that miss clay writes so charmingly about gaines gave a great tug at the root of a laurel and pulled himself to miss mary s feet on his arm he carried the wreath of roses and while the villagers and summer boarders screamed and applauded below he placed it on the queen s brow you are a gallant knight said miss mary if i could be your true knight always began gaines but miss mary laughed him dumb for compton scrambled over the edge of the rock one minute behind time what a twilight that was when they drove back to the hotel the opal of the valley turned slowly to purple the dark woods framed the lake as a mirror the tonic air stirred the very soul in one the first pale stars came out over the mountain tops where yet a faint glow of i beg your pardon mr gaines said adkins the man who believed new york to be the finest summer resort in the world opened his eyes and kicked over the mucilage bottle on his desk i i believe i was asleep he said it s the heat said adkins it s something awful in the city these nonsense said the other the city beats the country ten to one in summer fools go out tramping in muddy brooks and wear themselves out trying to catch little fish as long as your finger stay in town and keep comfortable that s my idea some letters just came said adkins i thought you might like to glance at them before you go let us look over his shoulder and read just a few lines of one of them my dear dear husband just received your letter ordering us to stay another month rita s cough is almost gone johnny has simply gone wild like a little indian will be the making of both children work so hard and i know that your business can hardly afford to keep us here so long best man that ever you always pretend that you like the city in summer trout fishing that you used to be so fond of and all to keep us well and happy come to you if it were not doing the babies so much good i stood last evening on chimney rock in exactly the same spot where i was when you put the wreath of roses on my head through all the world when you said you would be my true knight fifteen years ago dear just think have always been that to me ever and ever mary the man who said he thought new york the finest summer resort in the country dropped into a cafe on his way home and had a glass of beer under an electric fan wonder what kind of a fly old harding used he said to himself the last leaf in a little district west of washington square the streets have run crazy and broken themselves into small strips called places these places make strange angles and curves one street crosses itself a time or two an artist once discovered a valuable possibility in this street suppose a collector with a bill for paints paper and canvas should in traversing this route suddenly meet himself coming back without a cent having been paid on account so to quaint old greenwich village the art people soon came prowling hunting for north windows and eighteenth century gables and dutch attics and low rents then they imported some pewter mugs and a chafing dish or two from sixth avenue and became a colony at the top of a squatty three story brick sue and johnsy had their studio johnsy was familiar for joanna one was from maine the other from california they had met at the table d hote of an eighth street delmonico s and found their tastes in art chicory salad and bishop sleeves so congenial that the joint studio resulted that was in may in november a cold unseen stranger whom the doctors called pneumonia stalked about the colony touching one here and there with his icy fingers over on the east side this ravager strode boldly smiting his victims by scores but his feet trod slowly through the maze of the narrow and moss grown places mr pneumonia was not what you would call a chivalric old gentleman a mite of a little woman with blood thinned by california zephyrs was hardly fair game for the red fisted short breathed old duffer but johnsy he smote and she lay scarcely moving on her painted iron bedstead looking through the small dutch window panes at the blank side of the next brick house one morning the busy doctor invited sue into the hallway with a shaggy gray eyebrow she has one chance in let us say ten he said as he shook down the mercury in his clinical thermometer and that chance is for her to want to live this way people have of lining up on the side of the undertaker makes the entire pharmacopeia look silly your little lady has made up her mind that she s not going to get well has she anything on her mind she she wanted to paint the bay of naples some day said sue paint bosh has she anything on her mind worth thinking about twice a man for instance a man said sue with a jew s harp twang in her voice is a man worth but no doctor there is nothing of the kind well it is the weakness then said the doctor i will do all that science so far as it may filter through my efforts can accomplish but whenever my patient begins to count the carriages in her funeral procession i subtract per cent from the curative power of medicines if you will get her to ask one question about the new winter styles in cloak sleeves i will promise you a one in five chance for her instead of one in ten after the doctor had gone sue went into the workroom and cried a japanese napkin to a pulp then she swaggered into johnsy s room with her drawing board whistling ragtime johnsy lay scarcely making a ripple under the bedclothes with her face toward the window sue stopped whistling thinking she was asleep she arranged her board and began a pen and ink drawing to illustrate a magazine story young artists must pave their way to art by drawing pictures for magazine stories that young authors write to pave their way to literature as sue was sketching a pair of elegant horseshow riding trousers and a monocle on the figure of the hero an idaho cowboy she heard a low sound several times repeated she went quickly to the bedside johnsy s eyes were open wide she was looking out the window and counting counting backward twelve she said and a little later eleven and then ten and nine and then eight and seven almost together sue looked solicitously out the window what was there to count there was only a bare dreary yard to be seen and the blank side of the brick house twenty feet away an old old ivy vine gnarled and decayed at the roots climbed half way up the brick wall the cold breath of autumn had stricken its leaves from the vine until its skeleton branches clung almost bare to the crumbling bricks what is it dear asked sue six said johnsy in almost a whisper they re falling faster now three days ago there were almost a hundred it made my head ache to count them but now it s easy there goes another one there are only five left now five what dear tell your sudie leaves on the ivy vine when the last one falls i must go too i ve known that for three days didn t the doctor tell you oh i never heard of such nonsense complained sue with magnificent scorn what have old ivy leaves to do with your getting well and you used to love that vine so you naughty girl don t be a goosey why the doctor told me this morning that your chances for getting well real soon were let s see exactly what he said he said the chances were ten to one why that s almost as good a chance as we have in new york when we ride on the street cars or walk past a new building try to take some broth now and let sudie go back to her drawing so she can sell the editor man with it and buy port wine for her sick child and pork chops for her greedy self you needn t get any more wine said johnsy keeping her eyes fixed out the window there goes another no i don t want any broth that leaves just four i want to see the last one fall before it gets dark then i ll go too johnsy dear said sue bending over her will you promise me to keep your eyes closed and not look out the window until i am done working i must hand those drawings in by to morrow i need the light or i would draw the shade down couldn t you draw in the other room asked johnsy coldly i d rather be here by you said sue besides i don t want you to keep looking at those silly ivy leaves tell me as soon as you have finished said johnsy closing her eyes and lying white and still as a fallen statue because i want to see the last one fall i m tired of waiting i m tired of thinking i went to turn loose my hold on everything and go sailing down down just like one of those poor tired leaves try to sleep said sue i must call behrman up to be my model for the old hermit miner i ll not be gone a minute don t try to move till i come back old behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor beneath them he was past sixty and had a michael angelo s moses beard curling down from the head of a satyr along the body of an imp behrman was a failure in art forty years he had wielded the brush without getting near enough to touch the hem of his mistress s robe he had been always about to paint a masterpiece but had never yet begun it for several years he had painted nothing except now and then a daub in the line of commerce or advertising he earned a little by serving as a model to those young artists in the colony who could not pay the price of a professional he drank gin to excess and still talked of his coming masterpiece for the rest he was a fierce little old man who scoffed terribly at softness in any one and who regarded himself as especial mastiff in waiting to protect the two young artists in the studio above sue found behrman smelling strongly of juniper berries in his dimly lighted den below in one corner was a blank canvas on an easel that had been waiting there for twenty five years to receive the first line of the masterpiece she told him of johnsy s fancy and how she feared she would indeed light and fragile as a leaf herself float away when her slight hold upon the world grew weaker old behrman with his red eyes plainly streaming shouted his contempt and derision for such idiotic imaginings vass he cried is dere people in de world mit der foolishness to die because leafs dey drop off from a confounded vine i haf not heard of such a thing no i will not bose as a model for your fool hermit dunderhead vy do you allow dot silly pusiness to come in der prain of her ach dot poor lettle miss johnsy she is very ill and weak said sue and the fever has left her mind morbid and full of strange fancies very well mr behrman if you do not care to pose for me you needn t but i think you are a horrid old old flibbertigibbet you are just like a woman yelled behrman who said i will not bose go on i come mit you for half an hour i haf peen trying to say dot i am ready to bose gott dis is not any blace in which one so goot as miss yohnsy shall lie sick some day i vill baint a masterpiece and ve shall all go away gott yes johnsy was sleeping when they went upstairs sue pulled the shade down to the window sill and motioned behrman into the other room in there they peered out the window fearfully at the ivy vine then they looked at each other for a moment without speaking a persistent cold rain was falling mingled with snow behrman in his old blue shirt took his seat as the hermit miner on an upturned kettle for a rock when sue awoke from an hour s sleep the next morning she found johnsy with dull wide open eyes staring at the drawn green shade pull it up i want to see she ordered in a whisper wearily sue obeyed but lo after the beating rain and fierce gusts of wind that had endured through the livelong night there yet stood out against the brick wall one ivy leaf it was the last on the vine still dark green near its stem but with its serrated edges tinted with the yellow of dissolution and decay it hung bravely from a branch some twenty feet above the ground it is the last one said johnsy i thought it would surely fall during the night i heard the wind it will fall to day and i shall die at the same time dear dear said sue leaning her worn face down to the pillow think of me if you won t think of yourself what would i do but johnsy did not answer the lonesomest thing in all the world is a soul when it is making ready to go on its mysterious far journey the fancy seemed to possess her more strongly as one by one the ties that bound her to friendship and to earth were loosed the day wore away and even through the twilight they could see the lone ivy leaf clinging to its stem against the wall and then with the coming of the night the north wind was again loosed while the rain still beat against the windows and pattered down from the low dutch eaves when it was light enough johnsy the merciless commanded that the shade be raised the ivy leaf was still there johnsy lay for a long time looking at it and then she called to sue who was stirring her chicken broth over the gas stove i ve been a bad girl sudie said johnsy something has made that last leaf stay there to show me how wicked i was it is a sin to want to die you may bring me a little broth now and some milk with a little port in it and no bring me a hand mirror first and then pack some pillows about me and i will sit up and watch you cook an hour later she said sudie some day i hope to paint the bay of naples the doctor came in the afternoon and sue had an excuse to go into the hallway as he left even chances said the doctor taking sue s thin shaking hand in his with good nursing you ll win and now i must see another case i have downstairs behrman his name is some kind of an artist i believe pneumonia too he is an old weak man and the attack is acute there is no hope for him but he goes to the hospital to day to be made more comfortable the next day the doctor said to sue she s out of danger you ve won nutrition and care now that s all and that afternoon sue came to the bed where johnsy lay contentedly knitting a very blue and very useless woolen shoulder scarf and put one arm around her pillows and all i have something to tell you white mouse she said mr behrman died of pneumonia to day in the hospital he was ill only two days the janitor found him on the morning of the first day in his room downstairs helpless with pain his shoes and clothing were wet through and icy cold they couldn t imagine where he had been on such a dreadful night and then they found a lantern still lighted and a ladder that had been dragged from its place and some scattered brushes and a palette with green and yellow colors mixed on it and look out the window dear at the last ivy leaf on the wall didn t you wonder why it never fluttered or moved when the wind blew ah darling it s behrman s masterpiece he painted it there the night that the last leaf fell the count and the wedding guest one evening when andy donovan went to dinner at his second avenue boarding house mrs scott introduced him to a new boarder a young lady miss conway miss conway was small and unobtrusive she wore a plain snuffy brown dress and bestowed her interest which seemed languid upon her plate she lifted her diffident eyelids and shot one perspicuous judicial glance at mr donovan politely murmured his name and returned to her mutton mr donovan bowed with the grace and beaming smile that were rapidly winning for him social business and political advancement and erased the snuffy brown one from the tablets of his consideration two weeks later andy was sitting on the front steps enjoying his cigar there was a soft rustle behind and above him and andy turned his head and had his head turned just coming out the door was miss conway she wore a night black dress of crepe de crepe de oh this thin black goods her hat was black and from it drooped and fluttered an ebon veil filmy as a spider s web she stood on the top step and drew on black silk gloves not a speck of white or a spot of color about her dress anywhere her rich golden hair was drawn with scarcely a ripple into a shining smooth knot low on her neck her face was plain rather than pretty but it was now illuminated and made almost beautiful by her large gray eyes that gazed above the houses across the street into the sky with an expression of the most appealing sadness and melancholy gather the idea girls all black you know with the preference for crepe de oh crepe de chine that s it all black and that sad faraway look and the hair shining under the black veil you have to be a blonde of course and try to look as if although your young life had been blighted just as it was about to give a hop skip and a jump over the threshold of life a walk in the park might do you good and be sure to happen out the door at the right moment and oh it ll fetch em every time but it s fierce now how cynical i am ain t it to talk about mourning costumes this way mr donovan suddenly reinscribed miss conway upon the tablets of his consideration he threw away the remaining inch and a quarter of his cigar that would have been good for eight minutes yet and quickly shifted his center of gravity to his low cut patent leathers it s a fine clear evening miss conway he said and if the weather bureau could have heard the confident emphasis of his tones it would have hoisted the square white signal and nailed it to the mast to them that has the heart to enjoy it it is mr donovan said miss conway with a sigh mr donovan in his heart cursed fair weather heartless weather it should hail and blow and snow to be consonant with the mood of miss conway i hope none of your relatives i hope you haven t sustained a loss ventured mr donovan death has claimed said miss conway hesitating not a relative but one who but i will not intrude my brief upon you mr donovan intrude protested mr donovan why say miss conway i d be delighted that is i d be sorry i mean i m sure nobody could sympathize with you truer than i would miss conway smiled a little smile and oh it was sadder than her expression in repose laugh and the world laughs with you weep and they give you the laugh she quoted i have learned that mr donovan i have no friends or acquaintances in this city but you have been kind to me i appreciate it highly he had passed her the pepper twice at the table it s tough to be alone in new york that s a cinch said mr donovan but say whenever this little old town does loosen up and get friendly it goes the limit say you took a little stroll in the park miss conway don t you think it might chase away some of your mullygrubs and if you d allow me thanks mr donovan i d be pleased to accept of your escort if you think the company of one whose heart is filled with gloom could be anyways agreeable to you through the open gates of the iron railed old downtown park where the elect once took the air they strolled and found a quiet bench there is this difference between the grief of youth and that of old age youth s burden is lightened by as much of it as another shares old age may give and give but the sorrow remains the same he was my fiance confided miss conway at the end of an hour we were going to be married next spring i don t want you to think that i am stringing you mr donovan but he was a real count he had an estate and a castle in italy count fernando mazzini was his name i never saw the beat of him for elegance papa objected of course and once we eloped but papa overtook us and took us back i thought sure papa and fernando would fight a duel papa has a livery business in p kipsee you know finally papa came round all right and said we might be married next spring fernando showed him proofs of his title and wealth and then went over to italy to get the castle fixed up for us papa s very proud and when fernando wanted to give me several thousand dollars for my trousseau he called him down something awful he wouldn t even let me take a ring or any presents from him and when fernando sailed i came to the city and got a position as cashier in a candy store three days ago i got a letter from italy forwarded from p kipsee saying that fernando had been killed in a gondola accident that is why i am in mourning my heart mr donovan will remain forever in his grave i guess i am poor company mr donovan but i cannot take any interest in no one i should not care to keep you from gayety and your friends who can smile and entertain you perhaps you would prefer to walk back to the house now girls if you want to observe a young man hustle out after a pick and shovel just tell him that your heart is in some other fellow s grave young men are grave robbers by nature ask any widow something must be done to restore that missing organ to weeping angels in crepe de chine dead men certainly get the worst of it from all sides i m awfully sorry said mr donovan gently no we won t walk back to the house just yet and don t say you haven t no friends in this city miss conway i m awful sorry and i want you to believe i m your friend and that i m awful sorry i ve got his picture here in my locket said miss conway after wiping her eyes with her handkerchief i never showed it to anybody but i will to you mr donovan because i believe you to be a true friend mr donovan gazed long and with much interest at the photograph in the locket that miss conway opened for him the face of count mazzini was one to command interest it was a smooth intelligent bright almost a handsome face the face of a strong cheerful man who might well be a leader among his fellows i have a larger one framed in my room said miss conway when we return i will show you that they are all i have to remind me of fernando but he ever will be present in my heart that s a sure thing a subtle task confronted mr donovan that of supplanting the unfortunate count in the heart of miss conway this his admiration for her determined him to do but the magnitude or the undertaking did not seem to weigh upon his spirits the sympathetic but cheerful friend was the role he essayed and he played it so successfully that the next half hour found them conversing pensively across two plates of ice cream though yet there wars no diminution of the sadness in miss conway s large gray eyes before they parted in the hall that evening she ran upstairs and brought down the framed photograph wrapped lovingly in a white silk scarf mr donovan surveyed it with inscrutable eyes he gave me this the night he left for italy said miss conway i had the one for the locket made from this a fine looking man said mr donovan heartily how would it suit you miss conway to give me the pleasure of your company to coney next sunday afternoon a month later they announced their engagement to mrs scott and the other boarders miss conway continued to wear black a week after the announcement the two sat on the same bench in the downtown park while the fluttering leaves of the trees made a dim kinetoscopic picture of them in the moonlight but donovan had worn a look of abstracted gloom all day he was so silent to night that love s lips could not keep back any longer the questions that love s heart propounded what s the matter andy you are so solemn and grouchy to night nothing maggie i know better can t i tell you never acted this way before what is it it s nothing much maggie yes it is and i want to know i ll bet it s some other girl you are thinking about all right why don t you go get her if you want her take your arm away if you please i ll tell you then said andy wisely but i guess you won t understand it exactly you ve heard of mike sullivan haven t you big mike sullivan everybody calls him no i haven t said maggie and i don t want to if he makes you act like this who is he he s the biggest man in new york said andy almost reverently he can about do anything he wants to with tammany or any other old thing in the political line he s a mile high and as broad as east river you say anything against big mike and you ll have a million men on your collarbone in about two seconds why he made a visit over to the old country awhile back and the kings took to their holes like rabbits well big mike s a friend of mine i ain t more than deuce high in the district as far as influence goes but mike s as good a friend to a little man or a poor man as he is to a big one i met him to day on the bowery and what do you think he does comes up and shakes hands andy says he i ve been keeping cases on you you ve been putting in some good licks over on your side of the street and i m proud of you what ll you take to drink he takes a cigar and i take a highball i told him i was going to get married in two weeks andy says he send me an invitation so i ll keep in mind of it and i ll come to the wedding that s what big mike says to me and he always does what he says you don t understand it maggie but i d have one of my hands cut off to have big mike sullivan at our wedding it would be the proudest day of my life when he goes to a man s wedding there s a guy being married that s made for life now that s why i m maybe looking sore to night why don t you invite him then if he s so much to the mustard said maggie lightly there s a reason why i can t said andy sadly there s a reason why he mustn t be there don t ask me what it is for i can t tell you oh i don t care said maggie it s something about politics of course but it s no reason why you can t smile at me maggie said andy presently do you think as much of me as you did of your as you did of the count mazzini he waited a long time but maggie did not reply and then suddenly she leaned against his shoulder and began to cry to cry and shake with sobs holding his arm tightly and wetting the crepe de chine with tears there there there soothed andy putting aside his own trouble and what is it now andy sobbed maggie i ve lied to you and you ll never marry me or love me any more but i feel that i ve got to tell andy there never was so much as the little finger of a count i never had a beau in my life but all the other girls had and they talked about em and that seemed to make the fellows like em more and andy i look swell in black you know i do so i went out to a photograph store and bought that picture and had a little one made for my locket and made up all that story about the count and about his being killed so i could wear black and nobody can love a liar and you ll shake me andy and i ll die for shame oh there never was anybody i liked but you and that s all but instead of being pushed away she found andy s arm folding her closer she looked up and saw his face cleared and smiling could you could you forgive me andy sure said andy it s all right about that back to the cemetery for the count you ve straightened everything out maggie i was in hopes you would before the wedding day bully girl andy said maggie with a somewhat shy smile after she had been thoroughly assured of forgiveness did you believe all that story about the count well not to any large extent said andy reaching for his cigar case because it s big mike sullivan s picture you ve got in that locket of yours the country of elusion the cunning writer will choose an indefinable subject for he can then set down his theory of what it is and next at length his conception of what it is not and lo his paper is covered therefore let us follow the prolix and unmapable trail into that mooted country bohemia grainger sub editor of doc s magazine closed his roll top desk put on his hat walked into the hall punched the down button and waited for the elevator grainger s day had been trying the chief had tried to ruin the magazine a dozen times by going against grainger s ideas for running it a lady whose grandfather had fought with mcclellan had brought a portfolio of poems in person grainger was curator of the lion s house of the magazine that day he had lunched an arctic explorer a short story writer and the famous conductor of a slaughter house expose consequently his mind was in a whirl of icebergs maupassant and trichinosis but there was a surcease and a recourse there was bohemia he would seek distraction there and let s see he would call by for mary adrian half an hour later he threaded his way like a brazilian orchid hunter through the palm forest in the tiled entrance hall of the idealia apartment house one day the christeners of apartment houses and the cognominators of sleeping cars will meet and there will be some jealous and sanguinary knifing the clerk breathed grainger s name so languidly into the house telephone that it seemed it must surely drop from sheer inertia down to the janitor s regions but at length it soared dilatorily up to miss adrian s ear certainly mr grainger was to come up immediately a colored maid with an eliza crossing the ice expression opened the door of the apartment for him grainger walked sideways down the narrow hall a bunch of burnt umber hair and a sea green eye appeared in the crack of a door a long white undraped arm came out barring the way so glad you came ricky instead of any of the others said the eye light a cigarette and give it to me going to take me to dinner fine go into the front room till i finish dressing but don t sit in your usual chair there s pie in it meringue kappelman threw it at reeves last evening while he was reciting sophy has just come to straighten up is it lit thanks there s scotch on the mantel oh no it isn t that s chartreuse ask sophy to find you some i won t be long grainger escaped the meringue as he waited his spirits sank still lower the atmosphere of the room was as vapid as a zephyr wandering over a vesuvian lava bed relics of some feast lay about the room scattered in places where even a prowling cat would have been surprised to find them a straggling cluster of deep red roses in a marmalade jar bowed their heads over tobacco ashes and unwashed goblets a chafing dish stood on the piano a leaf of sheet music supported a stack of sandwiches in a chair mary came in dressed and radiant her gown was of that thin black fabric whose name through the change of a single vowel seems to summon visions ranging between the extremes of man s experience spelled with an e it belongs to gallic witchery and diaphanous dreams with an e it drapes lamentation and woe that evening they went to the cafe andre and as people would confide to you in a whisper that andre s was the only truly bohemian restaurant in town it may be well to follow them andre began his professional career as a waiter in a bowery ten cent eating house had you seen him there you would have called him tough to yourself not aloud for he would have soaked you as quickly as he would have soaked his thumb in your coffee he saved money and started a basement table d hote in eighth or ninth street one afternoon andre drank too much absinthe he announced to his startled family that he was the grand llama of thibet therefore requiring an empty audience hall in which to be worshiped he moved all the tables and chairs from the restaurant into the back yard wrapped a red table cloth around himself and sat on a step ladder for a throne when the diners began to arrive madame in a flurry of despair laid cloths and ushered them trembling outside between the tables clothes lines were stretched bearing the family wash a party of bohemia hunters greeted the artistic innovation with shrieks and acclamations of delight that week s washing was not taken in for two years when andre came to his senses he had the menu printed on stiffly starched cuffs and served the ices in little wooden tubs next he took down his sign and darkened the front of the house when you went there to dine you fumbled for an electric button and pressed it a lookout slid open a panel in the door looked at you suspiciously and asked if you were acquainted with senator herodotus q mcmilligan of the chickasaw nation if you were you were admitted and allowed to dine if you were not you were admitted and allowed to dine there you have one of the abiding principles of bohemia when andre had accumulated he moved up town near broadway in the fierce light that beats upon the thrown down there we find him and leave him with customers in pearls and automobile veils striving to catch his excellently graduated nod of recognition there is a large round table in the northeast corner of andre s at which six can sit to this table grainger and mary adrian made their way kappelman and reeves were already there and miss tooker who designed the may cover for the ladies notathome magazine and mrs pothunter who never drank anything but black and white highballs being in mourning for her husband who oh i ve forgotten what he did died like as not spaghetti weary reader wouldst take one penny in the slot peep into the fair land of bohemia then look and when you think you have seen it you have not and it is neither thimbleriggery nor astigmatism the walls of the cafe andre were covered with original sketches by the artists who furnished much of the color and sound of the place fair woman furnished the theme for the bulk of the drawings when you say sirens and siphons you come near to estimating the alliterative atmosphere of andre s first i want you to meet my friend miss adrian miss tooker and mrs pothunter you already know while she tucks in the fingers of her elbow gloves you shall have her daguerreotype so faint and uncertain shall the portrait be age somewhere between twenty seven and highneck evening dresses camaraderie in large bunches whatever the fearful word may mean habitat anywhere from seattle to terra del fuego temperament uncharted she let reeves squeeze her hand after he recited one of his poems but she counted the change after sending him out with a dollar to buy some pickled pig s feet deportment out of a possible morals mary was one of the princesses of bohemia in the first place it was a royal and a daring thing to have been named mary there are twenty fifines and heloises to one mary in the country of elusion now her gloves are tucked in miss tooker has assumed a june poster pose mrs pothunter has bitten her lips to make the red show reeves has several times felt his coat to make sure that his latest poem is in the pocket it had been neatly typewritten but he has copied it on the backs of letters with a pencil kappelman is underhandedly watching the clock it is ten minutes to nine when the hour comes it is to remind him of a story synopsis a french girl says to her suitor did you ask my father for my hand at nine o clock this morning as you said you would i did not he replies at nine o clock i was fighting a duel with swords in the bois de boulogne coward she hisses the dinner was ordered you know how the bohemian feast of reason keeps up with the courses humor with the oysters wit with the soup repartee with the entree brag with the roast knocks for whistler and kipling with the salad songs with the coffee the slapsticks with the cordials between miss adrian s eyebrows was the pucker that shows the intense strain it requires to be at ease in bohemia pat must come each sally mot and epigram every second of deliberation upon a reply costs you a bay leaf fine as a hair a line began to curve from her nostrils to her mouth to hold her own not a chance must be missed a sentence addressed to her must be as a piccolo each word of it a stop which she must be prepared to seize upon and play and she must always be quicker than a micmac indian to paddle the light canoe of conversation away from the rocks in the rapids that flow from the pierian spring for plodding reader the handwriting on the wall in the banquet hall of bohemia is laisser faire the gray ghost that sometimes peeps through the rings of smoke is that of slain old king convention freedom is the tyrant that holds them in slavery as the dinner waned hands reached for the pepper eruct rather than for the shaker of attic salt miss tooker with an elbow to business leaned across the table toward grainger upsetting her glass of wine now while you are fed and in good humor she said i want to make a suggestion to you about a new cover a good idea said grainger mopping the tablecloth with his napkin i ll speak to the waiter about it kappelman the painter was the cut up as a piece of delicate athenian wit he got up from his chair and waltzed down the room with a waiter that dependent no doubt an honest pachydermatous worthy tax paying art despising biped released himself from the unequal encounter carried his professional smile back to the dumb waiter and dropped it down the shaft to eternal oblivion reeves began to make keats turn in his grave mrs pothunter told the story of the man who met the widow on the train miss adrian hummed what is still called a chanson in the cafes of bridgeport grainger edited each individual effort with his assistant editor s smile which meant great but you ll have to send them in through the regular channels if i were the chief now but you know how it is and soon the head waiter bowed before them desolated to relate that the closing hour had already become chronologically historical so out all trooped into the starry midnight falling the street with gay laughter to be barked at by hopeful cabmen and enviously eyed by the dull inhabitants of an uninspired world grainger left mary at the elevator in the trackless palm forest of the idealia after he had gone she came down again carrying a small hand bag phoned for a cab drove to the grand central station boarded a commuter s train rode four hours with her burnt umber head bobbing against the red plush back of the seat and landed during a fresh stinging glorious sunrise at a deserted station the size of a peach crate called crocusville she walked a mile and clicked the latch of a gate a bare brown cottage stood twenty yards back an old man with a pearl white calvinistic face and clothes dyed blacker than a raven in a coal mine was washing his hands in a tin basin on the front porch how are you father said mary timidly i am as well as providence permits mary ann you will find your mother in the kitchen in the kitchen a cryptic gray woman kissed her glacially on the forehead and pointed out the potatoes which were not yet peeled for breakfast mary sat in a wooden chair and decorticated spuds with a thrill in her heart for breakfast there were grace cold bread potatoes bacon and tea you are pursuing the same avocation in the city concerning which you have advised us from time to time by letter i trust said her father yes said mary i am still reviewing books for the same publication after breakfast she helped wash the dishes and then all three sat in straigh back chairs in the bare floored parlor it is my custom said the old man on the sabbath day to read aloud from the great work entitled the apology for authorized and set forms of liturgy by the ecclesiastical philosopher and revered theologian jeremy taylor i know it said mary blissfully folding her hands for two hours the numbers of the great jeremy rolled forth like the notes of an oratorio played on the violoncello mary sat gloating in the new sensation of racking physical discomfort that the wooden chair brought her perhaps there is no happiness in life so perfect as the martyr s jeremy s minor chords soothed her like the music of a tom tom why oh why she said to herself does some one not write words to it at eleven they went to church in crocusville the back of the pine bench on which she sat had a penitential forward tilt that would have brought st simeon down in jealousy from his pillar the preacher singled her out and thundered upon her vicarious head the damnation of the world at each side of her an adamant parent held her rigidly to the bar of judgment an ant crawled upon her neck but she dared not move she lowered her eyes before the congregation a hundred eyed cerberus that watched the gates through which her sins were fast thrusting her her soul was filled with a delirious almost a fanatic joy for she was out of the clutch of the tyrant freedom dogma and creed pinioned her with beneficent cruelty as steel braces bind the feet of a crippled child she was hedged adjured shackled shored up strait jacketed silenced ordered when they came out the minister stopped to greet them mary could only hang her head and answer yes sir and no sir to his questions when she saw that the other women carried their hymn books at their waists with their left hands she blushed and moved hers there too from her right she took the three o clock train back to the city at nine she sat at the round table for dinner in the cafe andre nearly the same crowd was there where have you been to day asked mrs pothunter i phoned to you at twelve i have been away in bohemia answered mary with a mystic smile there mary has given it away she has spoiled my climax for i was to have told you that bohemia is nothing more than the little country in which you do not live if you try to obtain citizenship in it at once the court and retinue pack the royal archives and treasure and move away beyond the hills it is a hillside that you turn your head to peer at from the windows of the through express at exactly half past eleven kappelman deceived by a new softness and slowness of riposte and parry in mary adrian tried to kiss her instantly she slapped his face with such strength and cold fury that he shrank down sobered with the flaming red print of a hand across his leering features and all sounds ceased as when the shadows of great wings come upon a flock of chattering sparrows one had broken the paramount law of sham bohemia the law of laisser faire the shock came not from the blow delivered but from the blow received with the effect of a schoolmaster entering the play room of his pupils was that blow administered women pulled down their sleeves and laid prim hands against their ruffled side locks men looked at their watches there was nothing of the effect of a brawl about it it was purely the still panic produced by the sound of the ax of the fly cop conscience hammering at the gambling house doors of the heart with their punctilious putting on of cloaks with their exaggerated pretense of not having seen or heard with their stammering exchange of unaccustomed formalities with their false show of a light hearted exit i must take leave of my bohemian party mary has robbed me of my climax and she may go but i am not defeated somewhere there exists a great vault miles broad and miles long more capacious than the champagne caves of france in that vault are stored the anticlimaxes that should have been tagged to all the stories that have been told in the world i shall cheat that vault of one deposit minnie brown with her aunt came from crocusville down to the city to see the sights and because she had escorted me to fishless trout streams and exhibited to me open plumbed waterfalls and broken my camera while i julyed in her village i must escort her to the hives containing the synthetic clover honey of town especially did the custom made bohemia charm her the spaghetti wound its tendrils about her heart the free red wine drowned her belief in the existence of commercialism in the world she was dared and enchanted by the rugose wit that can be churned out of california claret but one evening i got her away from the smell of halibut and linoleum long enough to read to her the manuscript of this story which then ended before her entrance into it i read it to her because i knew that all the printing presses in the world were running to try to please her and some others and i asked her about it i didn t quite catch the trains said she how long was mary in crocusville ten hours and five minutes i replied well then the story may do said minnie but if she had stayed there a week kappelman would have got his kiss the ferry of unfulfilment at the street corner as solid as granite in the rush hour tide of humanity stood the man from nome the arctic winds and sun had stained him berry brown his eye still held the azure glint of the glaciers he was as alert as a fox as tough as a caribou cutlet and as broad gauged as the aurora borealis he stood sprayed by a niagara of sound the crash of the elevated trains clanging cars pounding of rubberless tires and the antiphony of the cab and truck drivers indulging in scarifying repartee and so with his gold dust cashed in to the merry air of a hundred thousand and with the cakes and ale of one week in gotham turning bitter on his tongue the man from nome sighed to set foot again in chilkoot the exit from the land of street noises and dead sea apple pies up sixth avenue with the tripping scurrying chattering bright eyed homing tide came the girl from sieber mason s the man from nome looked and saw first that she was supremely beautiful after his own conception of beauty and next that she moved with exactly the steady grace of a dog sled on a level crust of snow his third sensation was an instantaneous conviction that he desired her greatly for his own this quickly do men from nome make up their minds besides he was going back to the north in a short time and to act quickly was no less necessary a thousand girls from the great department store of sieber mason flowed along the sidewalk making navigation dangerous to men whose feminine field of vision for three years has been chiefly limited to siwash and chilkat squaws but the man from nome loyal to her who had resurrected his long cached heart plunged into the stream of pulchritude and followed her down twenty third street she glided swiftly looking to neither side no more flirtatious than the bronze diana above the garden her fine brown hair was neatly braided her neat waist and unwrinkled black skirt were eloquent of the double virtues taste and economy ten yards behind followed the smitten man from nome miss claribel colby the girl from sieber mason s belonged to that sad company of mariners known as jersey commuters she walked into the waiting room of the ferry and up the stairs and by a marvellous swift little run caught the ferry boat that was just going out the man from nome closed up his ten yards in three jumps and gained the deck close beside her miss colby chose a rather lonely seat on the outside of the upper cabin the night was not cold and she desired to be away from the curious eyes and tedious voices of the passengers besides she was extremely weary and drooping from lack of sleep on the previous night she had graced the annual ball and oyster fry of the west side wholesale fish dealers assistants social club no thus reducing her usual time of sleep to only three hours and the day had been uncommonly troublous customers had been inordinately trying the buyer in her department had scolded her roundly for letting her stock run down her best friend mamie tuthill had snubbed her by going to lunch with that dockery girl the girl from sieber mason s was in that relaxed softened mood that often comes to the independent feminine wage earner it is a mood most propitious for the man who would woo her then she has yearnings to be set in some home and heart to be comforted and to hide behind some strong arm and rest rest but miss claribel colby was also very sleepy there came to her side a strong man browned and dressed carelessly in the best of clothes with his hat in his hand lady said the man from nome respectfully excuse me for speaking to you but i i i saw you on the street and and oh gee remarked the girl from sieber mason s glancing up with the most capable coolness ain t there any way to ever get rid of you mashers i ve tried everything from eating onions to using hatpins be on your way freddie i m not one of that kind lady said the man from nome honest i m not as i say i saw you on the street and i wanted to know you so bad i couldn t help followin after you i was afraid i wouldn t ever see you again in this big town unless i spoke and that s why i done so miss colby looked once shrewdly at him in the dim light on the ferry boat no he did not have the perfidious smirk or the brazen swagger of the lady killer sincerity and modesty shone through his boreal tan it seemed to her that it might be good to hear a little of what he had to say you may sit down she said laying her hand over a yawn with ostentatious politness and mind don t get fresh or i ll call the steward the man from nome sat by her side he admired her greatly he more than admired her she had exactly the looks he had tried so long in vain to find in a woman could she ever come to like him well that was to be seen he must do all in his power to stake his claim anyhow my name s blayden said he henry blayden are you real sure it ain t jones asked the girl leaning toward him with delicious knowing raillery i m down from nome he went on with anxious seriousness i scraped together a pretty good lot of dust up there and brought it down with me oh say she rippled pursuing persiflage with engaging lightness then you must be on the white wings force i thought i d seen you somewhere you didn t see me on the street to day when i saw you i never look at fellows on the street well i looked at you and i never looked at anything before that i thought was half as pretty shall i keep the change yes i reckon so i reckon you could keep anything i ve got i reckon i m what you would call a rough man but i could be awful good to anybody i liked i ve had a rough time of it up yonder but i beat the game nearly ounces of dust was what i cleaned um while i was there goodness exclaimed miss colby obligingly sympathetic it must be an awful dirty place wherever it is and then her eyes closed the voice of the man from nome had a monotony in its very earnestness besides what dull talk was this of brooms and sweeping and dust she leaned her head back against the wall miss said the man from nome with deeper earnestness and monotony i never saw anybody i liked as well as i do you i know you can t think that way of me right yet but can t you give me a chance won t you let me know you and see if i can t make you like me the head of the girl from sieber mason s slid over gently and rested upon his shoulder sweet sleep had won her and she was dreaming rapturously of the wholesale fish dealers assistants ball the gentleman from nome kept his arms to himself he did not suspect sleep and yet he was too wise to attribute the movement to surrender he was greatly and blissfully thrilled but he ended by regarding the head upon his shoulder as an encouraging preliminary merely advanced as a harbinger of his success and not to be taken advantage of one small speck of alloy discounted the gold of his satisfaction had he spoken too freely of his wealth he wanted to be liked for himself i want to say miss he said that you can count on me they know me in the klondike from juneau to circle city and down the whole length of the yukon many a night i ve laid in the snow up there where i worked like a slave for three years and wondered if i d ever have anybody to like me i didn t want all that dust just myself i thought i d meet just the right one some tine and i done it to day money s a mighty good thing to have but to have the love of the one you like best is better still if you was ever to marry a man miss which would you rather he d have cash the word came sharply and loudly from miss colby s lips giving evidence that in her dreams she was now behind her counter in the great department store of sieber mason her head suddenly bobbed over sideways she awoke sat straight and rubbed her eyes the man from nome was gone gee i believe i ve been asleep said miss colby wonder what became of the white wings the tale of a tainted tenner money talks but you may think that the conversation of a little old ten dollar bill in new york would be nothing more than a whisper oh very well pass up this sotto voce autobiography of an x if you like if you are one of the kind that prefers to listen to john d s checkbook roar at you through a megaphone as it passes by all right but don t forget that small change can say a word to the point now and then the next time you tip your grocer s clerk a silver quarter to give you extra weight of his boss s goods read the four words above the lady s head how are they for repartee i am a ten dollar treasury note series of you may have seen one in a friend s hand on my face in the centre is a picture of the bison americanus miscalled a buffalo by fifty or sixty millions of americans the heads of capt lewis and capt clark adorn the ends on my back is the graceful figure of liberty or ceres or maxine elliot standing in the centre of the stage on a conservatory plant my references is or are section revised statutes ten cold hard dollars i don t say whether silver gold lead or iron uncle sam will hand you over his counter if you want to cash me in i beg you will excuse any conversational breaks that i make thanks i knew you would got that sneaking little respect and agreeable feeling toward even an x haven t you you see a tainted bill doesn t have much chance to acquire a correct form of expression i never knew a really cultured and educated person that could afford to hold a ten spot any longer than it would take to do an arthur duffy to the nearest that s all sign or delicatessen store for a six year old i ve had a lively and gorgeous circulation i guess i ve paid as many debts as the man who dies i ve been owned by a good many kinds of people but a little old ragged damp dingy five dollar silver certificate gave me a jar one day i was next to it in the fat and bad smelling purse of a butcher hey you sitting bull says i don t scrouge so anyhow don t you think it s about time you went in on a customs payment and got reissued for a series of you re a sight oh don t get crackly just because you re a buffalo bill says the fiver you d be limp too if you d been stuffed down in a thick cotton and lisle thread under an elastic all day and the thermometer not a degree under in the store i never heard of a pocketbook like that says i who carried you a shopgirl says the five spot what s that i had to ask you ll never know till their millennium comes says the fiver just then a two dollar bill behind me with a george washington head spoke up to the fiver aw cut out yer kicks ain t lisle thread good enough for yer if you was under all cotton like i ve been to day and choked up with factory dust till the lady with the cornucopia on me sneezed half a dozen times you d have some reason to complain that was the next day after i arrived in new york i came in a package of tens to a brooklyn bank from one of its pennsylvania correspondents and i haven t made the acquaintance of any of the five and two spot s friends pocketbooks yet silk for mine every time i was lucky money i kept on the move sometimes i changed hands twenty times a day i saw the inside of every business i fought for my owner s every pleasure it seemed that on saturday nights i never missed being slapped down on a bar tens were always slapped down while ones and twos were slid over to the bartenders folded i got in the habit of looking for mine and i managed to soak in a little straight or some spilled martini or manhattan whenever i could once i got tied up in a great greasy roll of bills in a pushcart peddler s jeans i thought i never would get in circulation again for the future department store owner lived on eight cents worth of dog meat and onions a day but this peddler got into trouble one day on account of having his cart too near a crossing and i was rescued i always will feel grateful to the cop that got me he changed me at a cigar store near the bowery that was running a crap game in the back room so it was the captain of the precinct after all that did me the best turn when he got his he blew me for wine the next evening in a broadway restaurant and i really felt as glad to get back again as an astor does when he sees the lights of charing cross a tainted ten certainly does get action on broadway i was alimony once and got folded in a little dogskin purse among a lot of dimes they were bragging about the busy times there were in ossining whenever three girls got hold of one of them during the ice cream season but it s slow moving vehicles keep to the right for the little bok tips when you think of the way we bison plasters refuse to stick to anything during the rush lobster hour the first i ever heard of tainted money was one night when a good thing with a van to his name threw me over with some other bills to buy a stack of blues about midnight a big easy going man with a fat face like a monk s and the eye of a janitor with his wages raised tooks me and a lot of other notes and rolled us into what is termed a wad among the money tainters ticket me for five hundred said he to the banker and look out for everything charlie i m going out for a stroll in the glen before the moonlight fades from the brow of the cliff if anybody finds the roof in their way there s wrapped in a comic supplement in the upper left hand corner of the safe be bold everywhere be bold but be not bowled over night i found myself between two gold certificates one of em says to me well old shorthorn you re in luck to night you ll see something of life old jack s going to make the tenderloin look like a hamburg steak explain says i i m used to joints but i don t care for filet mignon with the kind of sauce you serve xcuse me said the twenty old jack is the proprietor of this gambling house he s going on a whiz to night because he offered to a church and it refused to accept it because they said his money was tainted what is a church i asked oh i forgot says the twenty that i was talking to a tenner of course

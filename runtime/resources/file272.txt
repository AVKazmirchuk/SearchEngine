on which white sailed had cleared away from the horizon he had but to speak a word to geddie to find his credit negotiable for whatever goods he wanted from the store of brannigan company on the same day on which white arrived in new york keogh at the rear of a train of five pack mules loaded with hardware and cutlery set his face toward the grim interior mountains there the indian tribes wash gold dust from the auriferous streams and when a market is brought to them trading is brisk and muy bueno in the cordilleras in coralio time folded his wings and paced wearily along his drowsy path they who had most cheered the torpid hours were gone clancy had sailed on a spanish barque for colon contemplating a cut across the isthmus and then a further voyage to end at callao where the fighting was said to be on geddie whose quiet and genial nature had once served to mitigate the frequent dull reaction of lotus eating was now a home man happy with his bright orchid paula and never even dreaming of or regretting the unsolved sealed and monogramed bottle whose contents now inconsiderable were held safely in the keeping of the sea well may the walrus most discerning and eclectic of beasts place sealing wax midway on his program of topics that fall pertinent and diverting upon the ear atwood was gone he of the hospitable back porch and ingenuous cunning doctor gregg with his trepanning story smoldering within him was a whiskered volcano always showing signs of imminent eruption and was not to be considered in the ranks of those who might contribute to the amelioration of ennui the new consul s note chimed with the sad sea waves and the violent tropical greens he had not a bar of scheherezade or of the round table in his lute goodwin was employed with large projects what time he was loosed from them found him at his home where he loved to be therefore it will be seen that there was a dearth of fellowship and entertainment among the foreign contingent of coralio and then dicky maloney dropped down from the clouds upon the town and amused it nobody knew where dicky maloney hailed from or how he reached coralio he appeared there one day and that was all he afterward said that he came on the fruit steamer thor but an inspection of the thor s passenger list of that date was found to be maloneyless curiosity however soon perished and dicky took his place among the odd fish cast up by the caribbean he was an active devil may care rollicking fellow with an engaging gray eye the most irresistible grin a rather dark or much sunburned complexion and a head of the fieriest red hair ever seen in that country speaking the spanish language as well as he spoke english and seeming always to have plenty of silver in his pockets it was not long before he was a welcome companion whithersoever he went he had an extreme fondness for vino blanco and gained the reputation of being able to drink more of it than any three men in town everybody called him dicky everybody cheered up at the sight of him especially the natives to whom his marvellous red hair and his free and easy style were a constant delight and envy wherever you went in the town you would soon see dicky or hear his genial laugh and find around him a group of admirers who appreciated him both for his good nature and the white wine he was always so ready to buy a considerable amount of speculation was had concerning the object of his sojourn there until one day he silenced this by opening a small shop for the sale of tobacco dulces and the handiwork of the interior indians fibre and silk woven goods deerskin zapatos and basketwork of tule reeds even then he did not change his habits for he was drinking and playing cards half the day and night with the comandante the collector of customs the jefe politico and other gay dogs among the native officials one day dicky saw pasa the daughter of madama ortiz sitting in the side door of the hotel de los extranjeros he stopped in his tracks still for the first time in coralio and then he sped swift as a deer to find vasquez a gilded native youth to present him the young men had named pasa la santita naranjadita naranjadita is a spanish word for a certain color that you must go to more trouble to describe in english by saying the little saint tinted the most beautiful delicate slightly orange golden you will approximate the description of madama ortiz s daughter la madama ortiz sold rum in addition to other liquors now you must know that the rum expiates whatever opprobrium attends upon the other commodities for rum making mind you is a government monopoly and to keep a government dispensary assures respectability if not preeminence moreover the saddest of precisians could find no fault with the conduct of the shop customers drank there in the lowest of spirits and fearsomely as in the shadow of the dead for madama s ancient and vaunted lineage counteracted even the rum s behest to be merry for was she not of the iglesias who landed with pizarro and had not her deceased husband been comisionado de caminos y puentes for the district in the evenings pasa sat by the window in the room next to the one where they drank and strummed dreamily upon her guitar and then by twos and threes would come visiting young caballeros and occupy the prim line of chairs set against the wall of this room they were there to besiege the heart of la santita their method which is not proof against intelligent competition consisted of expanding the chest looking valorous and consuming a gross or two of cigarettes even saints delicately oranged prefer to be wooed differently dona pasa would tide over the vast chasms of nicotinized silence with music from her guitar while she wondered if the romances she had read about gallant and more more contiguous cavaliers were all lies at somewhat regular intervals madama would glide in from the dispensary with a sort of drought suggesting gleam in her eye and there would be a rustling of stiffly starched white trousers as one of the caballeros would propose an adjournment to the bar that dicky maloney would sooner or later explore this field was a thing to be foreseen there were few doors in coralio into which his red head had not been poked in an incredibly short space of time after his first sight of her he was there seated close beside her rocking chair there was no back against the wall poses in dicky s theory of wooing his plan of subjection was an attack at close range to carry the fortress with one concentrated ardent eloquent irresistible escalade that was dicky s way pasa was descended from the proudest spanish families in the country moreover she had had unusual advantages two years in a new orleans school had elevated her ambitions and fitted her for a fate above the ordinary maidens of her native land and yet here she succumbed to the first red haired scamp with a glib tongue and a charming smile that came along and courted her properly very soon dicky took her to the little church on the corner of the plaza and mrs maloney was added to her string of distinguished names and it was her fate to sit with her patient saintly eyes and figure like a bisque psyche behind the sequestered counter of the little shop while dicky drank and philandered with is frivolous acquaintances the women with their naturally fine instinct saw a chance for vivisection and delicately taunted her with his habits she turned upon them in a beautiful steady blaze of sorrowful contempt you meat cows she said in her level crystal clear tones you know nothing of a man your men are maromeros they are fit only to roll cigarettes in the shade until the sun strikes and shrivels them up they drone in your hammocks and you comb their hair and feed them with fresh fruit my man is of no such blood let him drink of the wine when he has taken sufficient of it to drown one of your flaccitos he will come home to me more of a man than one thousand of your pobrecitos my hair he smooths and braids to me he sings he himself removes my zapatos and there there upon each instep leaves a kiss he holds oh you will never understand blind ones who have never known a man sometimes mysterious things happened at night about dicky s shop while the front of it was dark in the little room back of it dicky and a few of his friends would sit about a table carrying on some kind of very quiet negocios until quite late finally he would let them out the front door very carefully and go upstairs to his little saint these visitors were generally conspirator like men with dark clothes and hats of course these dark things were noticed after a while and talked about dicky seemed to care nothing at all for the society of the alien residents of the town he avoided goodwin and his skilful escape from the trepanning story of doctor gregg is still referred to in coralio as a masterpiece of lightning diplomacy many letters arrived addressed to mr dicky maloney or senor dickee maloney to the considerable pride of pasa that so many people should desire to write to him only confirmed her own suspicion that the light from his red head shone around the world as to their contents she never felt curiosity there was a wife to you the one mistake dicky made in coralio was to run out of money at the wrong time where his money came from was a puzzle for the sales of his shop were next to nothing but that source failed and at a peculiarly unfortunate time it was when the comandante don senor el coronel encarnacion rios looked upon the little saint seated in the shop and felt his heart go pitapat the comandante who was versed in all the intricate art of gallantry first delicately hinted at his sentiments by donning his dress uniform and strutting up and down fiercely before her window pasa glancing demurely with her saintly eyes instantly perceived his resemblance to her parrot chichi and was diverted to the extent of smile the comandante saw the smile which was not intended for him convinced of an impression made he entered the shop confidently and advanced to open compliment pasa froze he pranced she flamed royally he was charmed to injudicious persistence she commanded him to leave the shop he tried to capture her hand and dicky entered smiling broadly full of white wine and the devil he spent five minutes in punishing the comandante scientifically and carefully so that the pain might be prolonged as far as possible at the end of that time he pitched the rash wooer out the door upon the stones of the street senseless a barefooted policeman who had been watching the affair from across the street blew a whistle a squad of four soldiers came running from the cuartel around the corner when they saw that the offender was dicky they stopped and blew more whistles which brought out reinforcements of eight deeming the odds against them sufficiently reduced the military advanced upon the disturber dicky being thoroughly imbued with the martial spirit stooped and drew the comandante s sword which was girded about him and charged his foe he chased the standing army four squares playfully prodding its squealing rear and hacking at its ginger colored heels but he was not so successful with the civic authorities six muscular nimble policemen overpowered him and conveyed him triumphantly but warily to jail el diablo colorado they dubbed him and derided the military for its defeat dicky with the rest of the prisoners could look out through the barred door at the grass of the little plaza at a row of orange trees and the red tile roofs and dobe walls of a line of insignificant stores at sunset along a path across this plaza came a melancholy procession of sad faced women bearing plantains cassava bread and fruit each coming with food to some wretch behind those bars to whom she still clung and furnished the means of life twice a day morning and evening they were permitted to come water was furnished to her compulsory guests by the republic but no food that evening dicky s name was called by the sentry and he stepped before the bars of the door there stood his little saint a black mantilla draped about her head and shoulders her face like glorified melancholy her clear eyes gazing longingly at him as if they might draw him between the bars to her she brought a chicken some oranges dulces and a loaf of white bread a soldier inspected the food and passed it in to dicky pasa spoke calmly as she always did briefly in her thrilling flute like tones angel of my life she said let it not be long that thou art away from me thou knowest that life is not a thing to be endured with thou not at my side tell me if i can do aught in this matter if not i will wait a little while i come again in the morning dicky with his shoes removed so as not to disturb his fellow prisoners tramped the floor of the jail half the night condemning his lack of money and the cause of it whatever that might have been he knew very well that money would have brought his release at once for two days succeeding pasa came at the appointed times and brought him food he eagerly inquired each time if a letter or package had come for him and she mournfully shook her head on the morning of the third day she brought only a small loaf of bread there were dark circles under her eyes she seemed as calm as ever by jingo said dicky who seemed to speak in english or spanish as the whim seized him this is dry provender muchachita is this the best you can dig up for a fellow pasa looked at him as a mother looks at a beloved but capricious babe think better of it she said in a low voice since for the next meal there will be nothing the last centavo is spent she pressed closer against the grating sell the goods in the shop take anything for them have i not tried did i not offer them for one tenth their cost not even one peso would any one give there is not one real in this town to assist dickee malonee dick clenched his teeth grimly that s the comandante he growled he s responsible for that sentiment wait oh wait till the cards are all out pasa lowered her voice to almost a whisper and listen heart of my heart she said i have endeavored to be brave but i cannot live without thee three days now dicky caught a faint gleam of steel from the folds of her mantilla for once she looked in his face and saw it without a smile stern menacing and purposeful then he suddenly raised his hand and his smile came back like a gleam of sunshine the hoarse signal of an incoming steamer s siren sounded in the harbor dicky called to the sentry who was pacing before the door what steamer comes the catarina of the vesuvius line without doubt of that line go you picarilla said dicky joyously to pasa to the american consul tell him i wish to speak with him see that he comes at once and look you let me see a different look in those eyes for i promise your head shall rest upon this arm tonight it was an hour before the consul came he held his green umbrella under his arm and mopped his forehead impatiently now see here maloney he began captiously you fellows seem to think you can cut up any kind of row and expect me to pull you out of it i m neither the war department nor a gold mine this country has its laws you know and there s one against pounding the senses out of the regular army you irish are forever getting into trouble i don t see what i can do anything like tobacco now to make you comfortable or newspapers son of eli interrupted dicky gravely you haven t changed an iota that is almost a duplicate of the speech you made when old koen s donkeys and geese got into the chapel loft and the culprits wanted to hide in your room oh heavens exclaimed the consul hurriedly adjusting his spectacles are you a yale man too were you in that crowd i don t seem to remember any one with red any one named maloney such a lot of college men seem to have misused their advantages one of the best mathematicians of the class of is selling lottery tickets in belize a cornell man dropped off here last month he was second steward on a guano boat i ll write to the department if you like maloney or if there s any tobacco or newspa there s nothing interrupted dicky shortly but this you go tell the captain of the catarina that dicky maloney wants to see him as soon as he can conveniently come tell him where i am hurry that s all the consul glad to be let off so easily hurried away the captain of the catarina a stout man sicilian born soon appeared shoving with little ceremony through the guards to the jail door the vesuvius fruit company had a habit of doing things that way in anchuria i am exceeding sorry exceeding sorry said the captain to see this occur i place myself at your service mr maloney what you need shall be furnished whatever you say shall be done dicky looked at him unsmilingly his red hair could not detract from his attitude of severe dignity as he stood tall and calm with his now grim mouth forming a horizontal line captain de lucco i believe i still have funds in the hands of your company ample and personal funds i ordered a remittance last week the money has not arrived you know what is needed in this game money and money and more money why has it not been sent by the cristobal replied de lucco gesticulating it was despatched where is the cristobal off cape antonio i spoke her with a broken shaft a tramp coaster was towing her back to new orleans i brought money ashore thinking your need for it might not withstand delay in this envelope is one thousand dollars there is more if you need it mr maloney for the present it will suffice said dicky softening as he crinkled the envelope and looked down at the half inch thickness of smooth dingy bills the long green he said gently with a new reverence in his gaze is there anything it will not buy captain i had three friends replied de lucco who was a bit of a philosopher who had money one of them speculated in stocks and made ten million another is in heaven and the third married a poor girl whom he loved the answer then said dicky is held by the almighty wall street and cupid so the question remains this queried the captain including dicky s surroundings in a significant gesture of his hand is it it is notiit is not connected with the business of your little shop there is no failure in your plans no no said dicky this is merely the result of a little private affair of mine a digression from the regular line of business they say for a complete life a man must know poverty love and war but they don t go well together capitan mio no there is no failure in my business the little shop is doing very well when the captain had departed dicky called the sergeant of the jail squad and asked am i preso by the military or by the civil authority surely there is no martial law in effect now senor bueno now go or send to the alcalde the juez de la paz and the jefe de los policios tell them i am prepared at once to satisfy the demands of justice a folded bill of the long green slid into the sergeant s hand then dicky s smile came back again for he knew that the hours of his captivity were numbered and he hummed in time with the sentry s tread they re hanging men and women now for lacking of the green so that night dicky sat by the window of the room over his shop an his little saint sat close by working at something silken and dainty dicky was thoughtful and grave his red hair was in an unusual state of disorder pasa s fingers often ached to smooth and arrange it but dicky would never allow it he was poring tonight over a great litter of maps and books and papers on his table until that perpendicular line came between his brows that always distressed pasa presently she went and brought his hat and stood with it until he looked up inquiringly it is sad for you here she explained go out and drink vino blanco come back when you get that smile you used to wear that is what i wish to see dicky laughed and threw down his papers the vino blanco stage is past it has served its turn perhaps after all there was less entered my mouth and more my ears than people thought but there will be no more maps or frowns tonight i promise you that come they sat upon a reed silleta at the window and watched the quivering gleams from the lights of the catarina reflected in the harbor presently pasa rippled out one of her infrequent chirrups of audible laughter i was thinking she began anticipating dicky s question of the foolish things girls have in their minds because i went to school in the states i used to have ambitions nothing less than to be the president s wife would satisfy me and look thou red picaroon to what obscure fate thou hast stolen me don t give up hope said dicky smiling more than one irishman has been the ruler of a south american country there was a dictator of chili named o higgins why not a president maloney of anchuria say the word santita mia and we ll make the race no no no thou red haired reckless one sighed pasa i am content she laid her head against his arm here xvi rouge et noir it has been indicated that disaffection followed the elevation of losada to the presidency this feeling continued to grow throughout the entire republic there seemed to be a spirit of silent sullen discontent even the old liberal party to which goodwin zavalla and other patriots had lent their aid was disappointed losada had failed to become a popular idol fresh taxes fresh import duties and more than all his tolerance of the outrageous oppression of citizens by the military had rendered him the most obnoxious president since the despicable alforan the majority of his own cabinet were out of sympathy with him the army which he had courted by giving it license to tyrannize had been his main and thus far adequate support but the most impolitic of the administration s moves had been when it antagonized the vesuvius fruit company an organization plying twelve steamers with a cash capital somewhat larger than anchuria s surplus and debt combined reasonably an established concern like the vesuvius would become irritated at having a small retail republic with no rating at all attempt to squeeze it so when the government proxies applied for a subsidy they encountered a polite refusal the president at once retaliated by clapping an export duty of one real per bunch on bananas a thing unprecedented in fruit growing countries the vesuvius company had invested large sums in wharves and plantations along the anchurian coast their agents had erected fine homes in the towns where they had their headquarters and heretofore had worked with the republic in good will and with advantage to both it would lose an immense sum if compelled to move out the selling price of bananas from vera cruz to trinidad was three reales per bunch this new duty of one real would have ruined the fruit growers in anchuria and have seriously discommoded the vesuvius company had it declined to pay it but for some reason the vesuvius continued to buy anchurian fruit paying four reals for it and not suffering the growers to bear the loss this apparent victory deceived his excellency and he began to hunger for more of it he sent an emissary to request a conference with a representative of the fruit company the vesuvius sent mr franzoni a little stout cheerful man always cool and whistling airs from verdi s operas senor espirition of the office of the minister of finance attempted the sandbagging in behalf of anchuria the meeting took place in the cabin of the salvador of the vesuvius line senor espirition opened negotiations by announcing that the government contemplated the building of a railroad to skirt the alluvial coast lands after touching upon the benefits such a road would confer upon the interests of the vesuvius he reached the definite suggestion that a contribution to the road s expenses of say fifty thousand pesos would not be more than an equivalent to benefits received mr franzoni denied that his company would receive any benefits from a contemplated road as its representative he must decline to contribute fifty thousand pesos but he would assume the responsibility of offering twenty five did senor espirition understand senor franzoni to mean twenty five thousand pesos by no means twenty five pesos and in silver not in gold your offer insults my government cried senor espirition rising with indignation then said mr franzoni in warning tone we will change it the offer was never changed could mr franzoni have meant the government this was the state of affairs in anchuria when the winter season opened at coralio at the end of the second year of losada s administration so when the government and society made its annual exodus to the seashore it was evident that the presidential advent would not be celebrated by unlimited rejoicing the tenth of november was the day set for the entrance into coralio of the gay company from the capital a narrow gauge railroad runs twenty miles into the interior from solitas the government party travels by carriage from san mateo to this road s terminal point and proceeds by train to solitas from here they march in grand procession to coralio where on the day of their coming festivities and ceremonies abound but this season saw an ominous dawning of the tenth of november although the rainy season was over the day seemed to hark back to reeking june a fine drizzle of rain fell all during the forenoon the procession entered coralio amid a strange silence president losada was an elderly man grizzly bearded with a considerable ratio of indian blood revealed in his cinnamon complexion his carriage headed the procession surrounded and guarded by captain cruz and his famous troop of one hundred light horse el ciento huilando colonel rocas followed with a regiment of the regular army the president s sharp beady eyes glanced about him for the expected demonstration of welcome but he faced a stolid indifferent array of citizens sightseers the anchurians are by birth and habit and they turned out to their last able bodied unit to witness the scene but they maintained an accusive silence they crowded the streets to the very wheel ruts they covered the red tile roofs to the eaves but there was never a viva from them no wreaths of palm and lemon branches or gorgeous strings of paper roses hung from the windows and balconies as was the custom there was an apathy a dull dissenting disapprobation that was the more ominous because it puzzled no one feared an outburst a revolt of the discontents for they had no leader the president and those loyal to him had never even heard whispered a name among them capable of crystallizing the dissatisfaction into opposition no there could be no danger the people always procured a new idol before they destroyed an old one at length after a prodigious galloping and curvetting of red sashed majors gold laced colonels and epauletted generals the procession formed for its annual progress down the calle grande to the casa morena where the ceremony of welcome to the visiting president always took place the swiss band led the line of march after it pranced the local comandante mounted and a detachment of his troops next came a carriage with four members of the cabinet conspicuous among them the minister of war old general pilar with his white moustache and his soldierly bearing then the president s vehicle containing also the ministers of finance and state and surrounded by captain cruz s light horse formed in a close double file of fours following them the rest of the officials of state the judges and distinguished military and social ornaments of public and private life as the band struck up and the movement began like a bird of ill omen the valhalla the swiftest steamship of the vesuvius line glided into the harbor in plain view of the president and his train of course there was nothing menacing about its arrival a business firm does not go to war with a nation but it reminded senor espirition and others in those carriages that the vesuvius fruit company was undoubtedly carrying something up its sleeve for them by the time the van of the procession had reached the government building captain cronin of the valhalla and mr vincenti member of the vesuvius company had landed and were pushing their way bluff hearty and nonchalant through the crowd on the narrow sidewalk clad in white linen big debonair with an air of good humored authority they made conspicuous figures among the dark mass of unimposing anchurians as they penetrated to within a few yards of the steps of the casa morena looking easily above the heads of the crowd they perceived another that towered above the undersized natives it was the fiery poll of dicky maloney against the wall close by the lower step and his broad seductive grin showed that he recognized their presence dicky had attired himself becomingly for the festive occasion in a well fitting black suit pasa was close by his side her head covered with the ubiquitous black mantilla mr vincenti looked at her attentively botticelli s madonna he remarked gravely i wonder when she got into the game i don t like his getting tangled with the women i hoped he would keep away from them captain cronin s laugh almost drew attention from the parade with that head of hair keep away from the women and a maloney hasn t he got a license but nonsense aside what do you think of the prospects it s a species of filibustering out of my line vincenti glanced again at dicky s head and smiled rouge et noir he said there you have it make your play gentlemen our money is on the red the lad s game said cronin with a commending look at the tall easy figure by the steps but tis all like fly by night theatricals to me the talk s bigger than the stage there s a smell of gasoline in the air and they re their own audience and scene shifters they ceased talking for general pilar had descended from the first carriage and had taken his stand upon the top step of casa morena as the oldest member of the cabinet custom had decreed that he should make the address of welcome presenting the keys of the official residence to the president at its close general pilar was one of the most distinguished citizens of the republic hero of three wars and innumerable revolutions he was an honored guest at european courts and camps an eloquent speaker and a friend to the people he represented the highest type of the anchurians holding in his hand the gilt keys of casa morena he began his address in a historical form touching upon each administration and the advance of civilization and prosperity from the first dim striving after liberty down to present times arriving at the regime of president losada at which point according to precedent he should have delivered a eulogy upon its wise conduct and the happiness of the people general pilar paused then he silently held up the bunch of keys high above his head with his eyes closely regarding it the ribbon with which they were bound fluttered in the breeze it still blows cried the speaker exultantly citizens of anchuria give thanks to the saints this night that our air is still free thus disposing of losada s administration he abruptly reverted to that of olivarra anchuria s most popular ruler olivarra had been assassinated nine years before while in the prime of life and usefulness a faction of the liberal party led by losada himself had been accused of the deed whether guilty or not it was eight years before the ambitious and scheming losada had gained his goal upon this theme general pilar s eloquence was loosed he drew the picture of the beneficent olivarra with a loving hand he reminded the people of the peace the security and the happiness they had enjoyed during that period he recalled in vivid detail and with significant contrast the last winter sojourn of president olivarra in coralio when his appearance at their fiestas was the signal for thundering vivas of love and approbation the first public expression of sentiment from the people that day followed a low sustained murmur went among them like the surf rolling along the shore ten dollars to a dinner at the saint charles remarked mr vincenti that rouge wins i never bet against my own interests said captain cronin lighting a cigar long winded old boy for his age what s he talking about my spanish replied vincenti runs about ten words to the minute his is something around two hundred whatever he s saying he s getting them warmed up friends and brothers general pilar was saying could i reach out my hand this day across the lamentable silence of the grave to olivarra the good to the ruler who was one of you whose tears fell when you sorrowed and whose smile followed your joy i would bring him back to you but olivarra is dead dead at the hands of a craven assassin the speaker turned and gazed boldly into the carriage of the president his arm remained extended aloft as if to sustain his peroration the president was listening aghast at this remarkable address of welcome he was sunk back upon his seat trembling with rage and dumb surprise his dark hands tightly gripping the carriage cushions half rising he extended one arm toward the speaker and shouted a harsh command at captain cruz the leader of the flying hundred sat his horse immovable with folded arms giving no sign of having heard losada sank back again his dark features distinctly paling who says that olivarra is dead suddenly cried the speaker his voice old as he was sounding like a battle trumpet his body lies in the grave but to the people he loved he has bequeathed his spirit yes more his learning his courage his kindness yes more his youth his image people of anchuria have you forgotten ramon the son of olivarra cronin and vincenti watching closely saw dicky maloney suddenly raise his hat tear off his shock of red hair leap up the steps and stand at the side of general pilar the minister of war laid his arm across the young man s shoulders all who had known president olivarra saw again his same lion like pose the same frank undaunted expression the same high forehead with the peculiar line of the clustering crisp black hair general pilar was an experienced orator he seized the moment of breathless silence that preceded the storm citizens of anchuria he trumpeted holding aloft the keys of casa morena i am here to deliver these keys the keys to your homes and liberty to your chosen president shall i deliver them to enrico olivarra s assassin or to his son olivarra olivarra the crowd shrieked and howled all vociferated the magic name men women children and the parrots and the enthusiasm was not confined to the blood of the plebs colonel rocas ascended the steps and laid his sword theatrically at young ramon olivarra s feet four members of the cabinet embraced him captain cruz gave a command and twenty of el ciento huilando dismounted and arranged themselves in a cordon about the steps of casa morena but ramon olivarra seized that moment to prove himself a born genius and politician he waved those soldiers aside and descended the steps to the street there without losing his dignity or the distinguished elegance that the loss of his red hair brought him betook the proletariat to his bosom the barefooted the dirty indians caribs babies beggars old young saints soldiers and sinners he missed none of them while this act of the drama was being presented the scene shifters had been busy at the duties that had been assigned to them two of cruz s dragoons had seized the bridle reins of losada s horses others formed a close guard around the carriage and they galloped off with the tyrant and his two unpopular ministers no doubt a place had been prepared for them there are a number of well barred stone apartments in coralio rouge wins said mr vincenti calmly lighting another cigar captain cronin had been intently watching the vicinity of the stone steps for some time good boy he exclaimed suddenly as if relieved i wondered if he was going to forget his kathleen mavourneen young olivarra had reascended the steps and spoken a few words to general pilar then that distinguished veteran descended to the ground and approached pasa who still stood wonder eyed where dicky had left her with his plumed hat in his hand and his medals and decorations shining on his breast the general spoke to her and gave her his arm and they went up the stone steps of the casa morena together and then ramon olivarra stepped forward and took both her hands before all the people and while the cheering was breaking out afresh everywhere captain cronin and mr vincenti turned and walked back toward the shore where the gig was waiting for them there ll be another presidente proclamada in the morning said mr vincenti musingly as a rule they are not as reliable as the elected ones but this youngster seems to have some good stuff in him he planned and maneuvered the entire campaign olivarra s widow you know was wealthy after her husband was assassinated she went to the states and educated her son at yale the vesuvius company hunted him up and backed him in the little game it s a glorious thing said cronin half jestingly to be able to discharge a government and insert one of your own choosing in these days oh it is only amatter of business said vincenti stopping and offering the stump of his cigar to a monkey that swung down from a lime tree and that is what moves the world of today that extra real on the price of bananas had to go we took the shortest way of removing it xvii two recalls there remains three duties to be performed before the curtain falls upon the patched comedy two have been promised the third is no less obligatory it was set forth in the program of this tropic vaudeville that it would be made known why shorty day of the columbia detective agency lost his position also that smith should come again to tell us what mystery he followed that night on the shores of anchuria when he strewed so many cigar stumps around the coconut palm during his lonely night vigil on the beach these things were promised but a bigger thing yet remains to be accomplished the clearing up of a seeming wrong that has been done according to the array of chronicled facts truthfully set forth that have been presented and one voice speaking shall do these three things two men sat on a stringer of a north river pier in the city of new york a steamer from the tropics had begun to unload bananas and oranges on the pier now and then a banana or two would fall from an overripe bunch and one of the two men would shamble forward seize the fruit and return to share it with his companion one of the men was in the ultimate stage of deterioration as far as rain and wind and sun could wreck the garments he wore it had been done in his person the ravages of drink were as plainly visible and yet upon his high bridged rubicund nose was jauntily perched a pair of shining and flawless gold rimmed glasses the other man was not so far gone upon the descending highway of the incompetents truly the flower of his manhood had gone to seed seed that perhaps no soil might sprout but there were still cross cuts along where he travelled through which he might yet regain the pathway of usefulness without disturbing the slumbering miracles this man was short and compactly built he had an oblique dead eye like that of a sting ray and the moustache of a cocktail mixer we know the eye and the moustache we know that smith of the luxurious yacht the gorgeous raiment the mysterious mission the magic disappearance has come again though shorn of the accessories of his former state at his third banana the man with the nose glasses spat it from him with a shudder deuce take all fruit he remarked in a patrician tone of disgust i lived for two years where these things grow the memory of their taste lingers with you the oranges are not so bad just see if you can gather a couple of them o day when the next broken crate comes up did you live down with the monkeys asked the other made tepidly garrulous by the sunshine and the alleviating meal of juicy fruit i was down there once myself but only for a few hours that was when i was with the columbia detective agency the monkey people did me up i d have my job yet if it hadn t been for them i ll tell you about it one day the chief sent a note around to the office that read send o day here at once for a big piece of business i was the crack detective of the agency at that time they always handed me the big jobs the address the chief wrote from was down in the wall street district when i got there i found him in a private office with a lot of directors who were looking pretty fuzzy they stated the case the president of the republic insurance company had skipped with about a tenth of a million dollars in cash the directors wanted him back pretty bad but they wanted the money worse they said they needed it they had traced the old gent s movements to where he boarded a tramp fruit steamer bound for south america that same morning with his daughter and a big gripsack all the family he had one of the directors had his steam yacht coaled and with steam up ready for a trip and he turned her over to me cart blongsh in four hours i was on board of her and hot on the trail of the fruit tub i had a pretty good idea where old wahrfield that was his name j churchill wahrfield would head for at that time we had a treaty with about every foreign country except belgium and that banana republic anchuria there wasn t a photo of old wahrfield to be had in new york he had been foxy there but i had his description and besides the lady with him would be a dead give away anywhere she was one of the high flyers in society not the kind that have their pictures in the sunday papers but the real sort that open chrysanthemum shows and christen battleships well sir we never got a sight of that fruit tub on the road the ocean is a pretty big place and i guess we took different paths across it but we kept going toward this anchuria where the fruiter was bound for we struck the monkey coast one afternoon about four there was a ratty looking steamer off shore taking on bananas the monkeys were loading her up with big barges it might be the one the old man had taken and it might not i went ashore to look around the scenery was pretty good i never saw any finer on the new york stage i struck an american on shore a big cool chap standing around with the monkeys he showed me the consul s office the consul was a nice young fellow he said the fruiter was the karlsefin running generally to new orleans but took her last cargo to new york then i was sure my people were on board although everybody told me that no passengers had landed i didn t think they would land until after dark for they might have been shy about it on account of seeing that yacht of mine hanging around so all i had to do was to wait and nab em when they came ashore i couldn t arrest old wahrfield without extradition papers but my play was to get the cash they generally give up if you strike em when they re tired and rattled and short on nerve after dark i sat under a coconut tree on the beach for a while and then i walked around and investigated that town some and it was enough to give you the lions if a man could stay in new york and be honest he d better do it than to hit that monkey town with a million dinky little mud houses grass over your shoe tops in the streets ladies in low neck and short sleeves walking around smoking cigars tree frogs rattling like a hose cart going to a ten blow big mountains dropping gravel in the back yards and the sea licking the paint off in front no sir a man had better be in god s country living on free lunch than there the main street ran along the beach and i walked down it and then turned up a kind of lane where the houses were made of poles and straw i wanted to see what the monkeys did when they weren t climbing coconut trees the very first shack i looked in i saw my people they must have come ashore while i was promenading a man about fifty smooth face heavy eyebrows dressed in black broadcloth looking like he was just about to say can any little boy in the sunday school answer that he was freezing on to a grip that weighed like a dozen gold bricks and a swell girl a regular peach with a fifth avenue cut was sitting on a wooden chair an old black woman was fixing some coffee and beans on a table the light they had come from a lantern hung on a nail i went and stood in the door and they looked at me and i said mr wahrfield you are my prisoner i hope for the lady s sake you will take the matter sensibly you know why i want you who are you says the old gent o day says i of the columbia detective agency and now sir let me give you a piece of good advice you go back and take your medicine like a man hand em back the boodle and maybe they ll let you off light go back easy and i ll put in a word for you i ll give you five minutes to decide i pulled out my watch and waited then the young lady chipped in she was one of the genuine high steppers you could tell by the way her clothes fit and the style she had that fifth avenue was made for her come inside she says don t stand in the door and disturb the whole street with that suit of clothes now what is it you want three minutes gone i said i ll tell you again while the other two tick off you ll admit being the president of the republic won t you i am says he well then says i it ought to be plain to you wanted in new york j churchill wahrfield president of the republic insurance company also the funds belonging to said company now in that grip in the unlawful possession of said j churchill wahrfield oh h h h says the young lady as if she was thinking you want to take us back to new york to take mr wahrfield there s no charge against you miss there ll be no objection of course to your returning with your father of a sudden the girl gave a tiny scream and grabbed the old boy around the neck oh father father she says kind of contralto can this be true have you taken money that is not yours speak father it made you shiver to hear the tremolo stop she put on her voice the old boy looked pretty bughouse when she first grappled him but she went on whispering in his ear and patting his offshoulder till he stood still but sweating a little she got him to one side and they talked together a minute and then he put on some gold eyeglasses and walked up and handed me the grip mr detective he says talking a little broken i conclude to return with you i have finished to discover that life on this desolate and displeased coast would be worse than to die itself i will go back and hurl myself upon the mercy of the republic company have you brought a sheep sheep says i i haven t a single ship cut in the young lady don t get funny father is of german birth and doesn t speak perfect english how did you come up the girl was all broke up she had a handkerchief to her face and kept saying every little bit h father father she walked up to me and laid her lily white hand on the clothes that had pained her at first i smelt a million violets she was a lulu i told her i came in a private yacht mr o day she says oh take us away from this horrid country at once can you will you say you will i ll try i said concealing the fact that i was dying to get them on salt water before they could change their mind one thing they both kicked against was going through the town to the boat landing said they dreaded publicity and now that they were going to return they had a hope that the thing might yet be kept out of the papers they swore they wouldn t go unless i got them out to the yacht without any one knowing it so i agreed to humor them the sailors who rowed me ashore were playing billiards in a bar room near the water waiting for orders and i proposed to have them take the boat down the beach half a mile or so and take us up there how to get them word was the question for i couldn t leave the grip with the prisoner and i couldn t take it with me not knowing but what the monkeys might stick me up the young lady says the old colored woman would take them a note i sat down and wrote it and gave it to the dame with plain directions what to do and she grins like a baboon and shakes her head then mr wahrfield handed her a string of foreign dialect and she nods her head and says see senor maybe fifty times and lights out with the note ld augusta only understands german said miss wahrfield smiling at me we stopped in her house to ask where we could find lodging and she insisted upon our having coffee she tells us she was raised in a german family in san domingo very likely i said but you can search me for german words except nix verstay and noch einst i would have called that see senor french though on a gamble well we three made a sneak around the edge of town so as not to be seen we got tangled in vines and ferns and the banana bushes and tropical scenery a good deal the monkey suburbs was as wild as places in central park we came out on the beach a good half mile below a brown chap was lying asleep under a coconut tree with a ten foot musket beside him mr wahrfield takes up the gun and pitches it into the sea the coast is guarded he says rebellion and plots ripen like fruit he pointed to the sleeping man who never stirred thus he says they perform trusts children i saw our boat coming and i struck a match and lit a piece of newspaper to show them where we were in thirty minutes we were on board the yacht the first thing mr wahrfield and his daughter and i took the grip into the owner s cabin opened it up and took an inventory there was one hundred and five thousand dollars united states treasury notes in it besides a lot of diamond jewelry and a couple of hundred havana cigars i gave the old man the cigars and a receipt for the rest of the lot as agent for the company and locked the stuff up in my private quarters i never had a pleasanter trip than that one after we got to sea the young lady turned out to be the jolliest ever the very first time we sat down to dinner and the steward filled her glass with champagne that director s yacht was a regular floating waldorf astoria she winks at me and says what s the use to borrow trouble mr fly cop here s hoping you may live to eat the hen that scratches on your grave there was a piano on board and she sat down to it and sung better than you give up two cases to hear plenty times she knew about nine operas clean through she was sure enough bon ton and swell she wasn t one of the among others present kind she belonged on the special mention list the old man too perked up amazingly on the way he passed the cigars and says to me once quite chipper out of a cloud of smoke mr o day somehow i think the republic company will not give me the much trouble guard well the gripvalise of the money mr o day for that it must be returned to them that it belongs when we finish to arrive when we landed in new york i phoned to the chief to meet us in that director s office we got in a cab and went there i carried the grip and we walked in and i was pleased to see that the chief had got together that same old crowd of moneybugs with pink faces and white vests to see us march in i set the grip on the table there s the money i said and your prisoner said the chief i pointed to mr wahrfield and he stepped forward and says the honor of a word with you sir to explain he and the chief went into another room and stayed ten minutes when they came back the chief looked as black as a ton of coal did this gentleman he says to me have this valise in his possession when you first saw him he did said i the chief took up the grip and handed it to the prisoner with a bow and says to the director crowd do any of you recognize this gentleman they all shook their pink faces allow me to present he goes on senor miraflores president of the republic of anchuria the senor has generously consented to overlook this outrageous blunder on condition that we undertake to secure him against the annoyance of public comment it is a concession on his part to overlook an insult for which he might claim international redress i think we can gratefully promise him secrecy in the matter they gave him a pink nod all round o day he says to me as a private detective you re wasted in a war where kidnapping governments is in the rules you d be invaluable come down to the office at eleven i knew what that meant so that s the president of the monkeys says i well why couldn t he have said so wouldn t it jar you xviii the vitagraphoscope vaudeville is intrinsically episodic and discontinuous its audiences do not demand denouements sufficient unto each turn is the evil thereof no one cares how many romances the singing comedienne may have had if she can capably sustain the limelight and a high note or two the audiences reck not if the performing dogs get to the pound the moment they have jumped through their last hoop they do not desire bulletins about the possible injuries received by the comic cyclist who retires head first from the stage in a crash of property china ware neither do they consider that their seat coupons entitle them to be instructed whether or no there is a sentiment between the lady solo banjoist and the irish monologist therefore let us have no lifting of the curtain upon a tableau of the united lovers backgrounded by defeated villainy and derogated by the comic osculating maid and butler thrown in as a sop to the cerberi of the fifty cent seats but our program ends with a brief turn or two and then to the exits whoever sits the show out may find if he will the slender thread that binds together though ever so slightly

yours lucius e applegate first vice president the republic insurance company the vitagraphoscope moving pictures the last sausage scene an artist s studio the artist a young man of prepossessing appearance sits in a dejected attitude amid a litter of sketches with his head resting upon his hand an oil stove stands on a pine box in the center of the studio the artist rises tightens his waist belt to another hole and lights the stove he goes to a tin bread box half hidden by a screen takes out a solitary link of sausage turns the box upside down to show that there is no more and chucks the sausage into a frying pan which he sets upon the stove the flame of the stove goes out showing that there is no more oil the artist in evident despair seizes the sausage in a sudden access of rage and hurls it violently from him at the same time a door opens and a man who enters receives the sausage forcibly against his nose he seems to cry out and is observed to make a dance step or two vigorously the newcomer is a ruddy faced active keen looking man apparently of irish ancestry next he is observed to laugh immoderately he kicks over the stove he claps the artist who is vainly striving to grasp his hand vehemently upon the back then he goes through a pantomime which to the sufficiently intelligent spectator reveals that he has acquired large sums of money by trading pot metal hatchets and razors to the indians of the cordillera mountains for gold dust he draws a roll of money as large as a small loaf of bread from his pocket and waves it above his head while at the same time he makes pantomime of drinking from a glass the artist hurriedly secures his hat and the two leave the studio together the writing on the sands scene the beach at nice a woman beautiful still young exquisitely clothed complacent poised reclines near the water idly scrawling letters in the sand with the staff of her silken parasol the beauty of her face is audacious her languid pose is one that you feel to be impermanent you wait expectant for her to spring or glide or crawl like a panther that has unaccountably become stock still she idly scrawls in the sand and the word that she always writes is isabel a man sits a few yards away you can see that they are companions ever if no longer comrades his face is dark and smooth and almost inscrutable but not quite the two speak little together the man also scratches on the sand with his cane and the word that he writes is anchuria and then he looks out where the mediterranean and the sky intermingle with death in his gaze the wilderness and thou scene the borders of a gentleman s estate in a tropical land an old indian with a mahogany colored face is trimming the grass on a grave by a mangrove swamp presently he rises to his feet and walks slowly toward a grove that is shaded by the gathering brief twilight in the edge of the grove stands a man who is stalwart with a kind and courteous air and a woman of a serene and clear cut loveliness when the old indian comes up to them the man drops money in his hand the grave tender with the stolid pride of his race takes it as his due and goes his way the two in the edge of the grove turn back along the dim pathway and walk close close for after all what is the world at its best but a little round field of the moving pictures with two walking together in it curtain the four million not very long ago some one invented the assertion that there were only four hundred people in new york city who were really worth noticing but a wiser man has arisen the census taker and his larger estimate of human interest has been preferred in marking out the field of these little stories of the four million tobin s palm tobin and me the two of us went down to coney one day for there was four dollars between us and tobin had need of distractions for there was katie mahorner his sweetheart of county sligo lost since she started for america three months before with two hundred dollars her own savings and one hundred dollars from the sale of tobin s inherited estate a fine cottage and pig on the bog shannaugh and since the letter that tobin got saying that she had started to come to him not a bit of news had he heard or seen of katie mahorner tobin advertised in the papers but nothing could be found of the colleen so to coney me and tobin went thinking that a turn at the chutes and the smell of the popcorn might raise the heart in his bosom but tobin was a hardheaded man and the sadness stuck in his skin he ground his teeth at the crying balloons he cursed the moving pictures and though he would drink whenever asked he scorned punch and judy and was for licking the tintype men as they came so i gets him down a side way on a board walk where the attractions were some less violent at a little six by eight stall tobin halts with a more human look in his eye tis here says he i will be diverted i ll have the palm of me hand investigated by the wonderful palmist of the nile and see if what is to be will be tobin was a believer in signs and the unnatural in nature he possessed illegal convictions in his mind along the subjects of black cats lucky numbers and the weather predictions in the papers we went into the enchanted chicken coop which was fixed mysterious with red cloth and pictures of hands with lines crossing em like a railroad centre the sign over the door says it is madame zozo the egyptian palmist there was a fat woman inside in a red jumper with pothooks and beasties embroidered upon it tobin gives her ten cents and extends one of his hands she lifts tohin s hand which is own brother to the hoof of a drayhorse and examines it to see whether tis a stone in the frog or a cast shoe he has come for man says this madame zozo the line of your fate shows tis not me foot at all says tobin interrupting sure tis no beauty but ye hold the palm of me hand the line shows says the madame that ye ve not arrived at your time of life without bad luck and there s more to come the mound of venus or is that a stone bruise shows that ye ve been in love there s been trouble in your life on account of your sweetheart tis katie mahorner she has references with whispers tobin to me in a loud voice to one side i see says the palmist a great deal of sorrow and tribulation with one whom ye cannot forget i see the lines of designation point to the letter k and the letter m in her name whist says tobin to me do ye hear that look out goes on the palmist for a dark man and a light woman for they ll both bring ye trouble ye ll make a voyage upon the water very soon and have a financial loss i see one line that brings good luck there s a man coming into your life who will fetch ye good fortune ye ll know him when ye see him by his crooked nose is his name set down asks tobin twill be convenient in the way of greeting when he backs up to dump off the good luck his name says the palmist thoughtful looking is not spelled out by the lines but they indicate tis a long one and the letter o should be in it there s no more to tell good evening don t block up the door tis wonderful how she knows says tobin as we walk to the pier as we squeezed through the gates a nigger man sticks his lighted segar against tobin s ear and there is trouble tobin hammers his neck and the women squeal and by presence of mind i drag the little man out of the way before the police comes tobin is always in an ugly mood when enjoying himself on the boat going back when the man calls who wants the good looking waiter tobin tried to plead guilty feeling the desire to blow the foam off a crock of suds but when he felt in his pocket he found himself discharged for lack of evidence somebody had disturbed his change during the commotion so we sat dry upon the stools listening to the dagoes fiddling on deck if anything tobin was lower in spirits and less congenial with his misfortunes than when we started on a seat against the railing was a young woman dressed suitable for red automobiles with hair the colour of an unsmoked meerschaum in passing by tobin kicks her foot without intentions and being polite to ladies when in drink he tries to give his hat a twist while apologising but he knocks it off and the wind carries it overboard tobin came back and sat down and i began to look out for him for the man s adversities were becoming frequent he was apt when pushed so close by hard luck to kick the best dressed man he could see and try to take command of the boat presently tobin grabs my arm and says excited jawn says he do ye know what we re doing we re taking a voyage upon the water there now says i subdue yeself the boat l land in ten minutes more look says he at the light lady upon the bench and have ye forgotten the nigger man that burned me ear and isn t the money i had gone a dollar sixty five it was i thought he was no more than summing up his catastrophes so as to get violent with good excuse as men will do and i tried to make him understand such things was trifles listen says tobin ye ve no ear for the gift of prophecy or the miracles of the inspired what did the palmist lady tell ye out of me hand tis coming true before your eyes look out says she for a dark man and a light woman they ll bring ye trouble have ye forgot the nigger man though be got some of it back from me fist can ye show me a lighter woman than the blonde lady that was the cause of me hat falling in the water and where s the dollar sixty five i had in me vest when we left the shooting gallery the way tobin put it it did seem to corroborate the art of prediction though it looked to me that these accidents could happen to any one at coney without the implication of palmistry tobin got up and walked around on deck looking close at the passengers out of his little red eyes i asked him the interpretation of his movements ye never know what tobin has in his mind until he begins to carry it out ye should know says he i m working out the salvation promised by the lines in me palm i m looking for the crooked nose man that s to bring the good luck tis all that will save us jawn did ye ever see a straighter nosed gang of hellions in the days of your life twas the nine thirty boat and we landed and walked up town through twenty second street tobin being without his hat on a street corner standing under a gas light and looking over the elevated road at the moon was a man a long man he was dressed decent with a segar between his teeth and i saw that his nose made two twists from bridge to end like the wriggle of a snake tobin saw it at the same time and i heard him breathe hard like a horse when you take the saddle off he went straight up to the man and i went with him good night to ye tobin says to the man the man takes out his segar and passes the compliments sociable would ye hand us your name asks tobin and let us look at the size of it it may be our duty to become acquainted with ye my name says the man polite is friedenhausman maximus g friedenhausman tis the right length says tobin do you spell it with an o anywhere down the stretch of it i do not says the man can ye spell it with an o inquires tobin turning anxious if your conscience says the man with the nose is indisposed toward foreign idioms ye might to please yourself smuggle the letter into the penultimate syllable tis well says tobin ye re in the presence of jawn malone and daniel tobin tis highly appreciated says the man with a bow and now since i cannot conceive that ye would hold a spelling bee upon the street corner will ye name some reasonable excuse for being at large by the two signs answers tobin trying to explain which ye display according to the reading of the egyptian palmist from the sole of me hand ye ve been nominated to offset with good luck the lines of trouble leading to the nigger man and the blonde lady with her feet crossed in the boat besides the financial loss of a dollar sixty five all so far fulfilled according to hoyle the man stopped smoking and looked at me have ye any amendments he asks to offer to that statement or are ye one too i thought by the looks of ye ye might have him in charge none says i to him except that as one horseshoe resembles another so are ye the picture of good luck as predicted by the hand of me friend if not then the lines of danny s hand may have been crossed i don t know there s two of ye says the man with the nose looking up and down for the sight of a policeman i ve enjoyed your company immense good night with that he shoves his segar in his mouth and moves across the street stepping fast but tobin sticks close to one side of him and me at the other what says he stopping on the opposite sidewalk and pushing back his hat do ye follow me i tell ye he says very loud i m proud to have met ye but it is my desire to be rid of ye i am off to me home do says tobin leaning against his sleeve do be off to your home and i will sit at the door of it till ye come out in the morning for the dependence is upon ye to obviate the curse of the nigger man and the blonde lady and the financial loss of the one sixty five tis a strange hallucination says the man turning to me as a more reasonable lunatic hadn t ye better get him home listen man says i to him daniel tobin is as sensible as he ever was maybe he is a bit deranged on account of having drink enough to disturb but not enough to settle his wits but he is no more than following out the legitimate path of his superstitions and predicaments which i will explain to you with that i relates the facts about the palmist lady and how the finger of suspicion points to him as an instrument of good fortune now understand i concludes my position in this riot i am the friend of me friend tobin according to me interpretations tis easy to be a friend to the prosperous for it pays tis not hard to be a friend to the poor for ye get puffed up by gratitude and have your picture printed standing in front of a tenement with a scuttle of coal and an orphan in each hand but it strains the art of friendship to be true friend to a born fool and that s what i m doing says i for in my opinion there s no fortune to be read from the palm of me hand that wasn t printed there with the handle of a pick and though ye ve got the crookedest nose in new york city i misdoubt that all the fortune tellers doing business could milk good luck from ye but the lines of danny s hand pointed to ye fair and i ll assist him to experiment with ye until he s convinced ye re dry after that the man turns sudden to laughing he leans against a corner and laughs considerable then he claps me and tobin on the backs of us and takes us by an arm apiece tis my mistake says he how could i be expecting anything so fine and wonderful to be turning the corner upon me i came near being found unworthy hard by says he is a cafe snug and suitable for the entertainment of idiosyncrasies let us go there and have drink while we discuss the unavailability of the categorical so saying he marched me and tobin to the back room of a saloon and ordered the drinks and laid the money on the table he looks at me and tobin like brothers of his and we have the segars ye must know says the man of destiny that me walk in life is one that is called the literary i wander abroad be night seeking idiosyncrasies in the masses and truth in the heavens above when ye came upon me i was in contemplation of the elevated road in conjunction with the chief luminary of night the rapid transit is poetry and art the moon but a tedious dry body moving by rote but these are private opinions for in the business of literature the conditions are reversed tis me hope to be writing a book to explain the strange things i have discovered in life ye will put me in a book says tobin disgusted will ye put me in a book i will not says the man for the covers will not hold ye not yet the best i can do is to enjoy ye meself for the time is not ripe for destroying the limitations of print ye would look fantastic in type all alone by meself must i drink this cup of joy but i thank ye boys i am truly grateful the talk of ye says tobin blowing through his moustache and pounding the table with his fist is an eyesore to me patience there was good luck promised out of the crook of your nose but ye bear fruit like the bang of a drum ye resemble with your noise of books the wind blowing through a crack sure now i would be thinking the palm of me hand lied but for the coming true of the nigger man and the blonde lady and whist says the long man would ye be led astray by physiognomy me nose will do what it can within bounds let us have these glasses filled again for tis good to keep idiosyncrasies well moistened they being subject to deterioration in a dry moral atmosphere so the man of literature makes good to my notion for he pays cheerful for everything the capital of me and tobin being exhausted by prediction but tobin is sore and drinks quiet with the red showing in his eye by and by we moved out for twas eleven o clock and stands a bit upon the sidewalk and then the man says he must be going home and invites me and tobin to walk that way we arrives on a side street two blocks away where there is a stretch of brick houses with high stoops and iron fences the man stops at one of them and looks up at the top windows which he finds dark tis me humble dwelling says he and i begin to perceive by the signs that me wife has retired to slumber therefore i will venture a bit in the way of hospitality tis me wish that ye enter the basement room where we dine and partake of a reasonable refreshment there will be some fine cold fowl and cheese and a bottle or two of ale ye will be welcome to enter and eat for i am indebted to ye for diversions the appetite and conscience of me and tobin was congenial to the proposition though twas sticking hard in danny s superstitions to think that a few drinks and a cold lunch should represent the good fortune promised by the palm of his hand step down the steps says the man with the crooked nose and i will enter by the door above and let ye in i will ask the new girl we have in the kitchen says he to make ye a pot of coffee to drink before ye go tis fine coffee katie mahorner makes for a green girl just landed three months step in says the man and i ll send her down to ye the gift of the magi one dollar and eighty seven cents that was all and sixty cents of it was in pennies pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied three times della counted it one dollar and eighty seven cents and the next day would be christmas there was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl so della did it which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs sniffles and smiles with sniffles predominating while the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second take a look at the home a furnished flat at per week it did not exactly beggar description but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad in the vestibule below was a letter box into which no letter would go and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name mr james dillingham young the dillingham had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid per week now when the income was shrunk to the letters of dillingham looked blurred as though they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming d but whenever mr james dillingham young came home and reached his flat above he was called jim and greatly hugged by mrs james dillingham young already introduced to you as della which is all very good della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag she stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat walking a grey fence in a grey backyard tomorrow would be christmas day and she had only with which to buy jim a present she had been saving every penny she could for months with this result twenty dollars a week doesn t go far expenses had been greater than she had calculated they always are only to buy a present for jim her jim many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him something fine and rare and sterling something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of being owned by jim there was a pier glass between the windows of the room perhaps you have seen a pier glass in an flat a very thin and very agile person may by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks della being slender had mastered the art suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass her eyes were shining brilliantly but her face had lost its colour within twenty seconds rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length now there were two possessions of the james dillingham youngs in which they both took a mighty pride one was jim s gold watch that had been his father s and his grandfather s the other was della s hair had the queen of sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate her majesty s jewels and gifts had king solomon been the janitor with all his treasures piled up in the basement jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed just to see him pluck at his beard from envy so now della s beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters it reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her and then she did it up again nervously and quickly once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet on went her old brown jacket on went her old brown hat with a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street where she stopped the sign read mme sofronie hair goods of all kinds one flight up della ran and collected herself panting madame large too white chilly hardly looked the sofronie will you buy my hair asked della i buy hair said madame take yer hat off and let s have a sight at the looks of it down rippled the brown cascade twenty dollars said madame lifting the mass with a practised hand give it to me quick said della oh and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings forget the hashed metaphor she was ransacking the stores for jim s present she found it at last it surely had been made for jim and no one else there was no other like it in any of the stores and she had turned all of them inside out it was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation as all good things should do it was even worthy of the watch as soon as she saw it she that it must be jim s it was like him quietness and value the description applied to both twenty one dollars they took from her for it and she hurried home with the cents with that chain on his watch jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company grand as the watch was he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain when della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason she got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love which is always a tremendous task dear friends a mammoth task within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny close lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy she looked at her reflection in the mirror long carefully and critically if jim doesn t kill me she said to herself before he takes a second look at me he ll say i look like a coney island chorus girl but what could i do oh what could i do with a dollar and eighty seven cents at o clock the coffee was made and the frying pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops jim was never late della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight and she turned white for just a moment she had a habit for saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things and now she whispered please god make him think i am still pretty the door opened and jim stepped in and closed it he looked thin and very serious poor fellow he was only twenty two and to be burdened with a family he needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves jim stopped inside the door as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail his eyes were fixed upon della and there was an expression in them that she could not read and it terrified her it was not anger nor surprise nor disapproval nor horror nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for he simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face della wriggled off the table and went for him jim darling she cried don t look at me that way i had my hair cut off and sold because i couldn t have lived through christmas without giving you a present it ll grow out again you won t mind will you i just had to do it my hair grows awfully fast say merry christmas jim and let s be happy you don t know what a nice what a beautiful nice gift i ve got for you you ve cut off your hair asked jim laboriously as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor cut it off and sold it said della don t you like me just as well anyhow i m me without my hair ain t i jim looked about the room curiously you say your hair is gone he said with an air almost of idiocy you needn t look for it said della it s sold i tell you sold and gone too it s christmas eve boy be good to me for it went for you maybe the hairs of my head were numbered she went on with sudden serious sweetness but nobody could ever count my love for you shall i put the chops on jim out of his trance jim seemed quickly to wake he enfolded his della for ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction eight dollars a week or a million a year what is the difference a mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer the magi brought valuable gifts but that was not among them this dark assertion will be illuminated later on jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table don t make any mistake dell he said about me i don t think there s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less but if you ll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first white fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper and then an ecstatic scream of joy and then alas a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat for there lay the combs the set of combs side and back that della had worshipped long in a broadway window beautiful combs pure tortoise shell with jewelled rims just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair they were expensive combs she knew and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession and now they were hers but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone but she hugged them to her bosom and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say my hair grows so fast jim and them della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried oh oh jim had not yet seen his beautiful present she held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm the dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit isn t it a dandy jim i hunted all over town to find it you ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now give me your watch i want to see how it looks on it instead of obeying jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled dell said he let s put our christmas presents away and keep em a while they re too nice to use just at present i sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs and now suppose you put the chops on the magi as you know were wise men wonderfully wise men who brought gifts to the babe in the manger they invented the art of giving christmas presents being wise their gifts were no doubt wise ones possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication and here i have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house but in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest of all who give and receive gifts such as they are wisest everywhere they are wisest they are the magi a cosmopolite in a cafe at midnight the cafe was crowded by some chance the little table at which i sat had escaped the eye of incomers and two vacant chairs at it extended their arms with venal hospitality to the influx of patrons and then a cosmopolite sat in one of them and i was glad for i held a theory that since adam no true citizen of the world has existed we hear of them and we see foreign labels on much luggage but we find travellers instead of cosmopolites i invoke your consideration of the scene the marble topped tables the range of leather upholstered wall seats the gay company the ladies dressed in demi state toilets speaking in an exquisite visible chorus of taste economy opulence or art the sedulous and largess loving garcons the music wisely catering to all with its raids upon the composers the melange of talk and laughter and if you will the wurzburger in the tall glass cones that bend to your lips as a ripe cherry sways on its branch to the beak of a robber jay i was told by a sculptor from mauch chunk that the scene was truly parisian my cosmopolite was named e rushmore coglan and he will be heard from next summer at coney island he is to establish a new attraction there he informed me offering kingly diversion and then his conversation rang along parallels of latitude and longitude he took the great round world in his hand so to speak familiarly contemptuously and it seemed no larger than the seed of a maraschino cherry in a table d hote grape fruit he spoke disrespectfully of the equator he skipped from continent to continent he derided the zones he mopped up the high seas with his napkin with a wave of his hand he would speak of a certain bazaar in hyderabad whiff he would have you on skis in lapland zip now you rode the breakers with the kanakas at kealaikahiki presto he dragged you through an arkansas post oak swamp let you dry for a moment on the alkali plains of his idaho ranch then whirled you into the society of viennese archdukes anon he would be telling you of a cold he acquired in a chicago lake breeze and how old escamila cured it in buenos ayres with a hot infusion of the chuchula weed you would have addressed a letter to e rushmore coglan esq the earth solar system the universe and have mailed it feeling confident that it would be delivered to him i was sure that i had found at last the one true cosmopolite since adam and i listened to his worldwide discourse fearful lest i should discover in it the local note of the mere globe trotter but his opinions never fluttered or drooped he was as impartial to cities countries and continents as the winds or gravitation and as e rushmore coglan prattled of this little planet i thought with glee of a great almost cosmopolite who wrote for the whole world and dedicated himself to bombay in a poem he has to say that there is pride and rivalry between the cities of the earth and that the men that breed from them they traffic up and down but cling to their cities hem as a child to the mother s gown and whenever they walk by roaring streets unknown they remember their native city most faithful foolish fond making her mere breathed name their bond upon their bond and my glee was roused because i had caught mr kipling napping here i had found a man not made from dust one who had no narrow boasts of birthplace or country one who if he bragged at all would brag of his whole round globe against the martians and the inhabitants of the moon expression on these subjects was precipitated from e rushmore coglan by the third corner to our table while coglan was describing to me the topography along the siberian railway the orchestra glided into a medley the concluding air was dixie and as the exhilarating notes tumbled forth they were almost overpowered by a great clapping of hands from almost every table it is worth a paragraph to say that this remarkable scene can be witnessed every evening in numerous cafes in the city of new york tons of brew have been consumed over theories to account for it some have conjectured hastily that all southerners in town hie themselves to cafes at nightfall this applause of the rebel air in a northern city does puzzle a little but it is not insolvable the war with spain many years generous mint and watermelon crops a few long shot winners at the new orleans race track and the brilliant banquets given by the indiana and kansas citizens who compose the north carolina society have made the south rather a fad in manhattan your manicure will lisp softly that your left forefinger reminds her so much of a gentleman s in richmond va oh certainly but many a lady has to work now the war you know when dixie was being played a dark haired young man sprang up from somewhere with a mosby guerrilla yell and waved frantically his soft brimmed hat then he strayed through the smoke dropped into the vacant chair at our table and pulled out cigarettes the evening was at the period when reserve is thawed one of us mentioned three wurzburgers to the waiter the dark haired young man acknowledged his inclusion in the order by a smile and a nod i hastened to ask him a question because i wanted to try out a theory i had would you mind telling me i began whether you are from the fist of e rushmore coglan banged the table and i was jarred into silence excuse me said he but that s a question i never like to hear asked what does it matter where a man is from is it fair to judge a man by his post office address why i ve seen kentuckians who hated whiskey virginians who weren t descended from pocahontas indianians who hadn t written a novel mexicans who didn t wear velvet trousers with silver dollars sewed along the seams funny englishmen spendthrift yankees cold blooded southerners narrow minded westerners and new yorkers who were too busy to stop for an hour on the street to watch a one armed grocer s clerk do up cranberries in paper bags let a man be a man and don t handicap him with the label of any section pardon me i said but my curiosity was not altogether an idle one i know the south and when the band plays dixie i like to observe i have formed the belief that the man who applauds that air with special violence and ostensible sectional loyalty is invariably a native of either secaucus n j or the district between murray hill lyceum and the harlem river this city i was about to put my opinion to the test by inquiring of this gentleman when you interrupted with your own larger theory i must confess and now the dark haired young man spoke to me and it became evident that his mind also moved along its own set of grooves i should like to be a periwinkle said he mysteriously on the top of a valley and sing tooralloo ralloo this was clearly too obscure so i turned again to coglan i ve been around the world twelve times said he i know an esquimau in upernavik who sends to cincinnati for his neckties and i saw a goatherder in uruguay who won a prize in a battle creek breakfast food puzzle competition i pay rent on a room in cairo egypt and another in yokohama all the year around i ve got slippers waiting for me in a tea house in shanghai and i don t have to tell em how to cook my eggs in rio de janeiro or seattle it s a mighty little old world what s the use of bragging about being from the north or the south or the old manor house in the dale or euclid avenue cleveland or pike s peak or fairfax county va or hooligan s flats or any place it ll be a better world when we quit being fools about some mildewed town or ten acres of swampland just because we happened to be born there you seem to be a genuine cosmopolite i said admiringly but it also seems that you would decry patriotism a relic of the stone age declared coglan warmly we are all brothers chinamen englishmen zulus patagonians and the people in the bend of the kaw river some day all this petty pride in one s city or state or section or country will be wiped out and we ll all be citizens of the world as we ought to be but while you are wandering in foreign lands i persisted do not your thoughts revert to some spo some dear and nary a spot interrupted e r coglan flippantly the terrestrial globular planetary hunk of matter slightly flattened at the poles and known as the earth is my abode i ve met a good many object bound citizens of this country abroad i ve seen men from chicago sit in a gondola in venice on a moonlight night and brag about their drainage canal i ve seen a southerner on being introduced to the king of england hand that monarch without batting his eyes the information that his grandaunt on his mother s side was related by marriage to the perkinses of charleston i knew a new yorker who was kidnapped for ransom by some afghanistan bandits his people sent over the money and he came back to kabul with the agent afghanistan the natives said to him through an interpreter well not so slow do you think oh i don t know says he and he begins to tell them about a cab driver at sixth avenue and broadway those ideas don t suit me i m not tied down to anything that isn t miles in diameter just put me down as e rushmore coglan citizen of the terrestrial sphere my cosmopolite made a large adieu and left me for he thought he saw some one through the chatter and smoke whom he knew so i was left with the would be periwinkle who was reduced to wurzburger without further ability to voice his aspirations to perch melodious upon the summit of a valley i sat reflecting upon my evident cosmopolite and wondering how the poet had managed to miss him he was my discovery and i believed in him how was it the men that breed from them they traffic up and down but cling to their cities hem as a child to the mother s gown not so e rushmore coglan with the whole world for his my meditations were interrupted by a tremendous noise and conflict in another part of the cafe i saw above the heads of the seated patrons e rushmore coglan and a stranger to me engaged in terrific battle they fought between the tables like titans and glasses crashed and men caught their hats up and were knocked down and a brunette screamed and a blonde began to sing teasing my cosmopolite was sustaining the pride and reputation of the earth when the waiters closed in on both combatants with their famous flying wedge formation and bore them outside still resisting i called mccarthy one of the french garcons and asked him the cause of the conflict the man with the red tie that was my cosmopolite said he got hot on account of things said about the bum sidewalks and water supply of the place he come from by the other guy why said i bewildered that man is a citizen of the world a cosmopolite he originally from mattawamkeag maine he said continued mccarthy and he wouldn t stand for no knockin the place between rounds the may moon shone bright upon the private boarding house of mrs murphy by reference to the almanac a large amount of territory will be discovered upon which its rays also fell spring was in its heydey with hay fever soon to follow the parks were green with new leaves and buyers for the western and southern trade flowers and summer resort agents were blowing the air and answers to lawson were growing milder handorgans fountains and pinochle were playing everywhere the windows of mrs murphy s boarding house were open a group of boarders were seated on the high stoop upon round flat mats like german pancakes in one of the second floor front windows mrs mccaskey awaited her husband supper was cooling on the table its heat went into mrs mccaskey at nine mr mccaskey came he carried his coat on his arm and his pipe in his teeth and he apologised for disturbing the boarders on the steps as he selected spots of stone between them on which to set his size width ds as he opened the door of his room he received a surprise instead of the usual stove lid or potato masher for him to dodge came only words mr mccaskey reckoned that the benign may moon had softened the breast of his spouse i heard ye came the oral substitutes for kitchenware ye can apollygise to riff raff of the streets for settin yer unhandy feet on the tails of their frocks but ye d walk on the neck of yer wife the length of a clothes line without so much as a kiss me fut and i m sure it s that long from rubberin out the windy for ye and the victuals cold such as there s money to buy after drinkin up yer wages at gallegher s every saturday evenin and the gas man here twice to day for his woman said mr mccaskey dashing his coat and hat upon a chair the noise of ye is an insult to me appetite when ye run down politeness ye take the mortar from between the bricks of the foundations of society tis no more than exercisin the acrimony of a gentleman when ye ask the dissent of ladies blockin the way for steppin between them will ye bring the pig s face of ye out of the windy and see to the food mrs mccaskey arose heavily and went to the stove there was something in her manner that warned mr mccaskey when the corners of her mouth went down suddenly like a barometer it usually foretold a fall of crockery and tinware pig s face is it said mrs mecaskey and hurled a stewpan full of bacon and turnips at her lord mr mccaskey was no novice at repartee he knew what should follow the entree on the table was a roast sirloin of pork garnished with shamrocks he retorted with this and drew the appropriate return of a bread pudding in an earthen dish a hunk of swiss cheese accurately thrown by her husband struck mrs mccaskey below one eye when she replied with a well aimed coffee pot full of a hot black semi fragrant liquid the battle according to courses should have ended but mr mccaskey was no cent table d hoter let cheap bohemians consider coffee the end if they would let them make that faux pas he was foxier still finger bowls were not beyond the compass of his experience they were not to be had in the pension murphy but their equivalent was at hand triumphantly he sent the granite ware wash basin at the head of his matrimonial adversary mrs mccaskey dodged in time she reached for a flatiron with which as a sort of cordial she hoped to bring the gastronomical duel to a close but a loud wailing scream downstairs caused both her and mr mccaskey to pause in a sort of involuntary armistice on the sidewalk at the corner of the house policeman cleary was standing with one ear upturned listening to the crash of household utensils tis jawn mccaskey and his missis at it again meditated the policeman i wonder shall i go up and stop the row i will not married folks they are and few pleasures they have twill not last long sure they ll have to borrow more dishes to keep it up with and just then came the loud scream below stairs betokening fear or dire extremity tis probably the cat said policeman cleary and walked hastily in the other direction the boarders on the steps were fluttered mr toomey an insurance solicitor by birth and an investigator by profession went inside to analyse the scream he returned with the news that mrs murphy s little boy mike was lost following the messenger out bounced mrs murphy two hundred pounds in tears and hysterics clutching the air and howling to the sky for the loss of thirty pounds of freckles and mischief bathos truly but mr toomey sat down at the side of miss purdy millinery and their hands came together in sympathy the two old maids misses walsh who complained every day about the noise in the halls inquired immediately if anybody had looked behind the clock major grigg who sat by his fat wife on the top step arose and buttoned his coat the little one lost he exclaimed i will scour the city his wife never allowed him out after dark but now she said go ludovic in a baritone voice whoever can look upon that mother s grief without springing to her relief has a heart of stone give me some thirty or sixty cents my love said the major lost children sometimes stray far i may need carfares old man denny hall room fourth floor back who sat on the lowest step trying to read a paper by the street lamp turned over a page to follow up the article about the carpenters strike mrs murphy shrieked to the moon oh ar r mike f r gawd s sake where is me little bit av a boy when d ye see him last asked old man denny with one eye on the report of the building trades league oh wailed mrs murphy twas yisterday or maybe four hours ago i dunno but it s lost he is me little boy mike he was playin on the sidewalk only this mornin or was it wednesday i m that busy with work tis hard to keep up with dates but i ve looked the house over from top to cellar and it s gone he is oh for the love av hiven silent grim colossal the big city has ever stood against its revilers they call it hard as iron they say that no pulse of pity beats in its bosom they compare its streets with lonely forests and deserts of lava but beneath the hard crust of the lobster is found a delectable and luscious food perhaps a different simile would have been wiser still nobody should take offence we would call no one a lobster without good and sufficient claws no calamity so touches the common heart of humanity as does the straying of a little child their feet are so uncertain and feeble the ways are so steep and strange major griggs hurried down to the corner and up the avenue into billy s place gimme a rye high he said to the servitor haven t seen a bow legged dirty faced little devil of a six year old loot kid around here anywhere have you mr toomey retained miss purdy s hand on the steps think of that dear little babe said miss purdy lost from his mother s side perhaps already fallen beneath the iron hoofs of galloping steeds oh isn t it dreadful ain t that right agreed mr toomey squeezing her hand say i start out and help look for um perhaps said miss purdy you should but oh mr toomey you are so dashing so reckless suppose in your enthusiasm some accident should befall you then what old man denny read on about the arbitration agreement with one finger on the lines in the second floor front mr and mrs mccaskey came to the window to recover their second wind mr mccaskey was scooping turnips out of his vest with a crooked forefinger and his lady was wiping an eye that the salt of the roast pork had not benefited they heard the outcry below and thrust their heads out of the window tis little mike is lost said mrs mccaskey in a hushed voice the beautiful little trouble making angel of a gossoon the bit of a boy mislaid said mr mccaskey leaning out of the window why now that s bad enough entirely the childer they be different if twas a woman i d be willin for they leave peace behind em when they go disregarding the thrust mrs mccaskey caught her husband s arm jawn she said sentimentally missis murphy s little bye is lost tis a great city for losing little boys six years old he was jawn tis the same age our little bye would have been if we had had one six years ago we never did said mr mccaskey lingering with the fact but if we had jawn think what sorrow would be in our hearts this night with our little phelan run away and stolen in the city nowheres at all ye talk foolishness said mr mccaskey tis pat he would be named after me old father in cantrim ye lie said mrs mccaskey without anger me brother was worth tin dozen bog trotting mccaskeys after him would the bye be named she leaned over the window sill and looked down at the hurrying and bustle below jawn said mrs mccaskey softly i m sorry i was hasty wid ye twas hasty puddin as ye say said her husband and hurry up turnips and get a move on ye coffee twas what ye could call a quick lunch all right and tell no lie mrs mccaskey slipped her arm inside her husband s and took his rough hand in hers listen at the cryin of poor mrs murphy she said tis an awful thing for a bit of a bye to be lost in this great big city if twas our little phelan jawn i d be breakin me heart awkwardly mr mccaskey withdrew his hand but he laid it around the nearing shoulders of his wife tis foolishness of course said he roughly but i d be cut up some meself if our little pat was kidnapped or anything but there never was any childer for us sometimes i ve been ugly and hard with ye judy forget it they leaned together and looked down at the heart drama being acted below long they sat thus people surged along the sidewalk crowding questioning filling the air with rumours and inconsequent surmises mrs murphy ploughed back and forth in their midst like a soft mountain down which plunged an audible cataract of tears couriers came and went loud voices and a renewed uproar were raised in front of the boarding house what s up now judy asked mr mccaskey tis missis murphy s voice said mrs mccaskey harking she says she s after finding little mike asleep behind the roll of old linoleum under the bed in her room mr mccaskey laughed loudly that s yer phelan he shouted sardonically divil a bit would a pat have done that trick if the bye we never had is strayed and stole by the powers call him phelan and see him hide out under the bed like a mangy pup mrs mccaskey arose heavily and went toward the dish closet with the corners of her mouth drawn down policeman cleary came back around the corner as the crowd dispersed surprised he upturned an ear toward the mccaskey apartment where the crash of irons and chinaware and the ring of hurled kitchen utensils seemed as loud as before policeman cleary took out his timepiece by the deported snakes he exclaimed jawn mccaskey and his lady have been fightin for an hour and a quarter by the watch the missis could give him forty pounds weight strength to his arm policeman cleary strolled back around the corner old man denny folded his paper and hurried up the steps just as mrs murphy was about to lock the door for the night the skylight room first mrs parker would show you the double parlours you would not dare to interrupt her description of their advantages and of the merits of the gentleman who had occupied them for eight years then you would manage to stammer forth the confession that you were neither a doctor nor a dentist mrs parker s manner of receiving the admission was such that you could never afterward entertain the same feeling toward your parents who had neglected to train you up in one of the professions that fitted mrs parker s parlours next you ascended one flight of stairs and looked at the second floor back at convinced by her second floor manner that it was worth the that mr toosenberry always paid for it until he left to take charge of his brother s orange plantation in florida near palm beach where mrs mcintyre always spent the winters that had the double front room with private bath you managed to babble that you wanted something still cheaper if you survived mrs parker s scorn you were taken to look at mr skidder s large hall room on the third floor mr skidder s room was not vacant he wrote plays and smoked cigarettes in it all day long but every room hunter was made to visit his room to admire the lambrequins after each visit mr skidder from the fright caused by possible eviction would pay something on his rent then oh then if you still stood on one foot with your hot hand clutching the three moist dollars in your pocket and hoarsely proclaimed your hideous and culpable poverty nevermore would mrs parker be cicerone of yours she would honk loudly the word clara she would show you her back and march downstairs then clara the coloured maid would escort you up the carpeted ladder that served for the fourth flight and show you the skylight room it occupied x feet of floor space at the middle of the hall on each side of it was a dark lumber closet or storeroom in it was an iron cot a washstand and a chair a shelf was the dresser its four bare walls seemed to close in upon you like the sides of a coffin your hand crept to your throat you gasped you looked up as from a well and breathed once more through the glass of the little skylight you saw a square of blue infinity two dollars suh clara would say in her half contemptuous half tuskegeenial tones one day miss leeson came hunting for a room she carried a typewriter made to be lugged around by a much larger lady she was a very little girl with eyes and hair that had kept on growing after she had stopped and that always looked as if they were saying goodness me why didn t you keep up with us mrs parker showed her the double parlours in this closet she said one could keep a skeleton or anaesthetic or coal but i am neither a doctor nor a dentist said miss leeson with a shiver mrs parker gave her the incredulous pitying sneering icy stare that she kept for those who failed to qualify as doctors or dentists and led the way to the second floor back eight dollars said miss leeson dear me i m not hetty if i do look green i m just a poor little working girl show me something higher and lower mr skidder jumped and strewed the floor with cigarette stubs at the rap on his door excuse me mr skidder said mrs parker with her demon s smile at his pale looks i didn t know you were in i asked the lady to have a look at your lambrequins they re too lovely for anything said miss leeson smiling in exactly the way the angels do after they had gone mr skidder got very busy erasing the tall black haired heroine from his latest unproduced play and inserting a small roguish one with heavy bright hair and vivacious features anna held ll jump at it said mr skidder to himself putting his feet up against the lambrequins and disappearing in a cloud of smoke like an aerial cuttlefish presently the tocsin call of clara sounded to the world the state of miss leeson s purse a dark goblin seized her mounted a stygian stairway thrust her into a vault with a glimmer of light in its top and muttered the menacing and cabalistic words two dollars i ll take it sighed miss leeson sinking down upon the squeaky iron bed every day miss leeson went out to work at night she brought home papers with handwriting on them and made copies with her typewriter sometimes she had no work at night and then she would sit on the steps of the high stoop with the other roomers miss leeson was not intended for a sky light room when the plans were drawn for her creation she was gay hearted and full of tender whimsical fancies once she let mr skidder read to her three acts of his great unpublished comedy it s no kid or the heir of the subway there was rejoicing among the gentlemen roomers whenever miss leeson had time to sit on the steps for an hour or two but miss longnecker the tall blonde who taught in a public school and said well really to everything you said sat on the top step and sniffed and miss dorn who shot at the moving ducks at coney every sunday and worked in a department store sat on the bottom step and sniffed miss leeson sat on the middle step and the men would quickly group around her especially mr skidder who had cast her in his mind for the star part in a private romantic unspoken drama in real life and especially mr hoover who was forty five fat flush and foolish and especially very young mr evans who set up a hollow cough to induce her to ask him to leave off cigarettes the men voted her the funniest and jolliest ever but the sniffs on the top step and the lower step were implacable i pray you let the drama halt while chorus stalks to the footlights and drops an epicedian tear upon the fatness of mr hoover tune the pipes to the tragedy of tallow the bane of bulk the calamity of corpulence tried out falstaff might have rendered more romance to the ton than would have romeo s rickety ribs to the ounce a lover may sigh but he must not puff to the train of momus are the fat men remanded in vain beats the faithfullest heart above a inch belt avaunt hoover hoover forty five flush and foolish might carry off helen herself hoover forty five flush foolish and fat is meat for perdition there was never a chance for you hoover as mrs parker s roomers sat thus one summer s evening miss leeson looked up into the firmament and cried with her little gay laugh why there s billy jackson i can see him from down here too all looked up some at the windows of skyscrapers some casting about for an airship jackson guided it s that star explained miss leeson pointing with a tiny finger not the big one that twinkles the steady blue one near it i can see it every night through my skylight i named it billy jackson well really said miss longnecker i didn t know you were an astronomer miss leeson oh yes said the small star gazer i know as much as any of them about the style of sleeves they re going to wear next fall in mars well really said miss longnecker the star you refer to is gamma of the constellation cassiopeia it is nearly of the second magnitude and its meridian passage is oh said the very young mr evans i think billy jackson is a much better name for it same here said mr hoover loudly breathing defiance to miss longnecker i think miss leeson has just as much right to name stars as any of those old astrologers had well really said miss longnecker i wonder whether it s a shooting star remarked miss dorn i hit nine ducks and a rabbit out of ten in the gallery at coney sunday he doesn t show up very well from down here said miss leeson you ought to see him from my room you know you can see stars even in the daytime from the bottom of a well at night my room is like the shaft of a coal mine and it makes billy jackson look like the big diamond pin that night fastens her kimono with there came a time after that when miss leeson brought no formidable papers home to copy and when she went out in the morning instead of working she went from office to office and let her heart melt away in the drip of cold refusals transmitted through insolent office boys this went on there came an evening when she wearily climbed mrs parker s stoop at the hour when she always returned from her dinner at the restaurant but she had had no dinner as she stepped into the hall mr hoover met her and seized his chance he asked her to marry him and his fatness hovered above her like an avalanche she dodged and caught the balustrade he tried for her hand and she raised it and smote him weakly in the face step by step she went up dragging herself by the railing she passed mr skidder s door as he was red inking a stage direction for myrtle delorme miss leeson in his unaccepted comedy to pirouette across stage from l to the side of the count up the carpeted ladder she crawled at last and opened the door of the skylight room she was too weak to light the lamp or to undress she fell upon the iron cot her fragile body scarcely hollowing the worn springs and in that erebus of the skylight room she slowly raised her heavy eyelids and smiled for billy jackson was shining down on her calm and bright and constant through the skylight there was no world about her she was sunk in a pit of blackness with but that small square of pallid light framing the star that she had so whimsically and oh so ineffectually named miss longnecker must be right it was gamma of the constellation cassiopeia and not billy jackson and yet she could not let it be gamma as she lay on her back she tried twice to raise her arm the third time she got two thin fingers to her lips and blew a kiss out of the black pit to billy jackson her arm fell back limply good bye billy she murmured faintly you re millions of miles away and you won t even twinkle once but you kept where i could see you most of the time up there when there wasn t anything else but darkness to look at didn t you millions of miles good bye billy jackson clara the coloured maid found the door locked at the next day and they forced it open vinegar and the slapping of wrists and burnt feathers proving of no avail some one ran to phone for an ambulance in due time it backed up to the door with much gong clanging and the capable young medico in his white linen coat ready active confident with his smooth face half debonair half grim danced up the steps ambulance call to he said briefly what s the trouble oh yes doctor sniffed mrs parker as though her trouble that there should be trouble in the house was the greater i can t think what can be the matter with her nothing we could do would bring her to it s a young woman a miss elsie yes a miss elsie leeson never before in my house what room cried the doctor in a terrible voice to which mrs parker was a stranger the skylight room it evidently the ambulance doctor was familiar with the location of skylight rooms he was gone up the stairs four at a time mrs parker followed slowly as her dignity demanded on the first landing she met him coming back bearing the astronomer in his arms he stopped and let loose the practised scalpel of his tongue not loudly gradually mrs parker crumpled as a stiff garment that slips down from a nail ever afterward there remained crumples in her mind and body sometimes her curious roomers would ask her what the doctor said to her let that be she would answer if i can get forgiveness for having heard it i will be satisfied the ambulance physician strode with his burden through the pack of hounds that follow the curiosity chase and even they fell back along the sidewalk abashed for his face was that of one who bears his own dead they noticed that he did not lay down upon the bed prepared for it in the ambulance the form that he carried and all that he said was drive like h l wilson to the driver that is all is it a story in the next morning s paper i saw a little news item and the last sentence of it may help you as it helped me to weld the incidents together it recounted the reception into bellevue hospital of a young woman who had been removed from no east street suffering from debility induced by starvation it concluded with these words dr william jackson the ambulance physician who attended the case says the patient will recover a service of love when one loves one s art no service seems too hard that is our premise this story shall draw a conclusion from it and show at the same time that the premise is incorrect that will be a new thing in logic and a feat in story telling somewhat older than the great wall of china joe larrabee came out of the post oak flats of the middle west pulsing with a genius for pictorial art at six he drew a picture of the town pump with a prominent citizen passing it hastily this effort was framed and hung in the drug store window by the side of the ear of corn with an uneven number of rows at twenty he left for new york with a flowing necktie and a capital tied up somewhat closer delia caruthers did things in six octaves so promisingly in a pine tree village in the south that her relatives chipped in enough in her chip hat for her to go north and finish they could not see her f but that is our story joe and delia met in an atelier where a number of art and music students had gathered to discuss chiaroscuro wagner music rembrandt s works pictures waldteufel wall paper chopin and oolong joe and delia became enamoured one of the other or each of the other as you please and in a short time were married for see above when one loves one s art no service seems too hard mr and mrs larrabee began housekeeping in a flat it was a lonesome flat something like the a sharp way down at the left hand end of the keyboard and they were happy for they had their art and they had each other and my advice to the rich young man would be sell all thou hast and give it to the poor janitor for the privilege of living in a flat with your art and your delia flat dwellers shall indorse my dictum that theirs is the only true happiness if a home is happy it cannot fit too close let the dresser collapse and become a billiard table let the mantel turn to a rowing machine the escritoire to a spare bedchamber the washstand to an upright piano let the four walls come together if they will so you and your delia are between but if home be the other kind let it be wide and long enter you at the golden gate hang your hat on hatteras your cape on cape horn and go out by the labrador joe was painting in the class of the great magister you know his fame his fees are high his lessons are light his high lights have brought him renown delia was studying under rosenstock you know his repute as a disturber of the piano keys they were mighty happy as long as their money lasted so is every but i will not be cynical their aims were very clear and defined joe was to become capable very soon of turning out pictures that old gentlemen with thin side whiskers and thick pocketbooks would sandbag one another in his studio for the privilege of buying delia was to become familiar and then contemptuous with music so that when she saw the orchestra seats and boxes unsold she could have sore throat and lobster in a private dining room and refuse to go on the stage but the best in my opinion was the home life in the little flat the ardent voluble chats after the day s study the cozy dinners and fresh light breakfasts the interchange of ambitions ambitions interwoven each with the other s or else inconsiderable the mutual help and inspiration and overlook my artlessness stuffed olives and cheese sandwiches at p m but after a while art flagged it sometimes does even if some switchman doesn t flag it everything going out and nothing coming in as the vulgarians say money was lacking to pay mr magister and herr rosenstock their prices when one loves one s art no service seems too hard so delia said she must give music lessons to keep the chafing dish bubbling for two or three days she went out canvassing for pupils one evening she came home elated joe dear she said gleefully i ve a pupil and oh the loveliest people general general a b pinkney s daughter on seventy first street such a splendid house joe you ought to see the front door byzantine i think you would call it and inside oh joe i never saw anything like it before my pupil is his daughter clementina i dearly love her already she s a delicate thing dresses always in white and the sweetest simplest manners only eighteen years old i m to give three lessons a week and just think joe a lesson i don t mind it a bit for when i get two or three more pupils i can resume my lessons with herr rosenstock now smooth out that wrinkle between your brows dear and let s have a nice supper that s all right for you dele said joe attacking a can of peas with a carving knife and a hatchet but how about me do you think i m going to let you hustle for wages while i philander in the regions of high art not by the bones of benvenuto cellini i guess i can sell papers or lay cobblestones and bring in a dollar or two delia came and hung about his neck joe dear you are silly you must keep on at your studies it is not as if i had quit my music and gone to work at something else while i teach i learn i am always with my music and we can live as happily as millionaires on a week you mustn t think of leaving mr magister all right said joe reaching for the blue scalloped vegetable dish but i hate for you to be giving lessons it isn t art but you re a trump and a dear to do it when one loves one s art no service seems too hard said delia magister praised the sky in that sketch i made in the park said joe and tinkle gave me permission to hang two of them in his window i may sell one if the right kind of a moneyed idiot sees them i m sure you will said delia sweetly and now let s be thankful for gen pinkney and this veal roast during all of the next week the larrabees had an early breakfast joe was enthusiastic about some morning effect sketches he was doing in central park and delia packed him off breakfasted coddled praised and kissed at o clock art is an engaging mistress it was most times o clock when he returned in the evening at the end of the week delia sweetly proud but languid triumphantly tossed three five dollar bills on the x inches centre table of the x feet flat parlour sometimes she said a little wearily clementina tries me i m afraid she doesn t practise enough and i have to tell her the same things so often and then she always dresses entirely in white and that does get monotonous but gen pinkney is the dearest old man i wish you could know him joe he comes in sometimes when i am with clementina at the piano he is a widower you know and stands there pulling his white goatee and how are the semiquavers and the demisemiquavers progressing he always asks i wish you could see the wainscoting in that drawing room joe and those astrakhan rug portieres and clementina has such a funny little cough i hope she is stronger than she looks oh i really am getting attached to her she is so gentle and high bred gen pinkney s brother was once minister to bolivia and then joe with the air of a monte cristo drew forth a ten a five a two and a one all legal tender notes and laid them beside delia s earnings sold that watercolour of the obelisk to a man from peoria he announced overwhelmingly don t joke with me said delia not from peoria all the way i wish you could see him dele fat man with a woollen muffler and a quill toothpick he saw the sketch in tinkle s window and thought it was a windmill at first he was game though and bought it anyhow he ordered another an oil sketch of the lackawanna freight depot to take back with him music lessons oh i guess art is still in it i m so glad you ve kept on said delia heartily you re bound to win dear thirty three dollars we never had so much to spend before we ll have oysters to night and filet mignon with champignons said joe were is the olive fork on the next saturday evening joe reached home first he spread his on the parlour table and washed what seemed to be a great deal of dark paint from his hands half an hour later delia arrived her right hand tied up in a shapeless bundle of wraps and bandages how is this asked joe after the usual greetings delia laughed but not very joyously clementina she explained insisted upon a welsh rabbit after her lesson she is such a queer girl welsh rabbits at in the afternoon the general was there you should have seen him run for the chafing dish joe just as if there wasn t a servant in the house i know clementina isn t in good health she is so nervous in serving the rabbit she spilled a great lot of it boiling hot over my hand and wrist it hurt awfully joe and the dear girl was so sorry but gen pinkney joe that old man nearly went distracted he rushed downstairs and sent somebody they said the furnace man or somebody in the basement out to a drug store for some oil and things to bind it up with it doesn t hurt so much now what s this asked joe taking the hand tenderly and pulling at some white strands beneath the bandages it s something soft said delia that had oil on it oh joe did you sell another sketch she had seen the money on the table did i said joe just ask the man from peoria he got his depot to day and he isn t sure but he thinks he wants another parkscape and a view on the hudson what time this afternoon did you burn your hand dele five o clock i think said dele plaintively the iron i mean the rabbit came off the fire about that time you ought to have seen gen pinkney joe when sit down here a moment dele said joe he drew her to the couch sat beside her and put his arm across her shoulders what have you been doing for the last two weeks dele he asked she braved it for a moment or two with an eye full of love and stubbornness and murmured a phrase or two vaguely of gen pinkney but at length down went her head and out came the truth and tears i couldn t get any pupils she confessed and i couldn t bear to have you give up your lessons and i got a place ironing shirts in that big twentyfourth street laundry and i think i did very well to make up both general pinkney and clementina don t you joe and when a girl in the laundry set down a hot iron on my hand this afternoon i was all the way home making up that story about the welsh rabbit you re not angry are you joe and if i hadn t got the work you mightn t have sold your sketches to that man from peoria he wasn t from peoria said joe slowly well it doesn t matter where he was from how clever you are joe and kiss me joe and what made you ever suspect that i wasn t giving music lessons to clementina i didn t said joe until to night and i wouldn t have then only i sent up this cotton waste and oil from the engine room this afternoon for a girl upstairs who had her hand burned with a smoothing iron i ve been firing the engine in that laundry for the last two weeks and then you didn t my purchaser from peoria said joe and gen pinkney are both creations of the same art but you wouldn t call it either painting or music and then they both laughed and joe began when one loves one s art no service seems but delia stopped him with her hand on his lips no she said just when one loves the coming out of maggie eevery saturday night the clover leaf social club gave a hop in the hall of the give and take athletic association on the east side in order to attend one of these dances you must be a member of the give and take or if you belong to the division that starts off with the right foot in waltzing you must work in rhinegold s paper box factory still any clover leaf was privileged to escort or be escorted by an outsider to a single dance but mostly each give and take brought the paper box girl that he affected and few strangers could boast of having shaken a foot at the regular hops maggie toole on account of her dull eyes broad mouth and left handed style of footwork in the twostep went to the dances with anna mccarty and her fellow anna and maggie worked side by side in the factory and were the greatest chums ever so anna always made jimmy burns take her by maggie s house every saturday night so that her friend could go to the dance with them the give and take athletic association lived up to its name the hall of the association in orchard street was fitted out with muscle making inventions with the fibres thus builded up the members were wont to engage the police and rival social and athletic organisations in joyous combat between these more serious occupations the saturday night hop with the paper box factory girls came as a refining influence and as an efficient screen for sometimes the tip went round and if you were among the elect that tiptoed up the dark back stairway you might see as neat and satisfying a little welter weight affair to a finish as ever happened inside the ropes on saturdays rhinegold s paper box factory closed at p m on one such afternoon anna and maggie walked homeward together at maggie s door anna said as usual be ready at seven sharp mag and jimmy and me ll come by for you but what was this instead of the customary humble and grateful thanks from the non escorted one there was to be perceived a high poised head a prideful dimpling at the corners of a broad mouth and almost a sparkle in a dull brown eye thanks anna said maggie but you and jimmy needn t bother to night i ve a gentleman friend that s coming round to escort me to the hop the comely anna pounced upon her friend shook her chided and beseeched her maggie toole catch a fellow plain dear loyal unattractive maggie so sweet as a chum so unsought for a two step or a moonlit bench in the little park how was it when did it happen who was it you ll see to night said maggie flushed with the wine of the first grapes she had gathered in cupid s vineyard he s swell all right he s two inches taller than jimmy and an up to date dresser i ll introduce him anna just as soon as we get to the hall anna and jimmy were among the first clover leafs to arrive that evening anna s eyes were brightly fixed upon the door of the hall to catch the first glimpse of her friend s catch at miss toole swept into the hall with her escort quickly her triumphant eye discovered her chum under the wing of her faithful jimmy oh gee cried anna mag ain t made a hit oh no swell fellow well i guess style look at um go as far as you like said jimmy with sandpaper in his voice cop him out if you want him these new guys always win out with the push don t mind me he don t squeeze all the limes i guess huh shut up jimmy you know what i mean i m glad for mag first fellow she ever had oh here they come across the floor maggie sailed like a coquettish yacht convoyed by a stately cruiser and truly her companion justified the encomiums of the faithful chum he stood two inches taller than the average give and take athlete his dark hair curled his eyes and his teeth flashed whenever he bestowed his frequent smiles the young men of the clover leaf club pinned not their faith to the graces of person as much as they did to its prowess its achievements in hand to hand conflicts and its preservation from the legal duress that constantly menaced it the member of the association who would bind a paperbox maiden to his conquering chariot scorned to employ beau brummel airs they were not considered honourable methods of warfare the swelling biceps the coat straining at its buttons over the chest the air of conscious conviction of the supereminence of the male in the cosmogony of creation even a calm display of bow legs as subduing and enchanting agents in the gentle tourneys of cupid these were the approved arms and ammunition of the clover leaf gallants they viewed then genuflexions and alluring poses of this visitor with their chins at a new angle a friend of mine mr terry o sullivan was maggie s formula of introduction she led him around the room presenting him to each new arriving clover leaf almost was she pretty now with the unique luminosity in her eyes that comes to a girl with her first suitor and a kitten with its first mouse maggie toole s got a fellow at last was the word that went round among the paper box girls pipe mag s floor walker thus the give and takes expressed their indifferent contempt usually at the weekly hops maggie kept a spot on the wall warm with her back she felt and showed so much gratitude whenever a self sacrificing partner invited her to dance that his pleasure was cheapened and diminished she had even grown used to noticing anna joggle the reluctant jimmy with her elbow as a signal for him to invite her chum to walk over his feet through a two step but to night the pumpkin had turned to a coach and six terry o sullivan was a victorious prince charming and maggie toole winged her first butterfly flight and though our tropes of fairyland be mixed with those of entomology they shall not spill one drop of ambrosia from the rose crowned melody of maggie s one perfect night the girls besieged her for introductions to her fellow the clover leaf young men after two years of blindness suddenly perceived charms in miss toole they flexed their compelling muscles before her and bespoke her for the dance thus she scored but to terry o sullivan the honours of the evening fell thick and fast he shook his curls he smiled and went easily through the seven motions for acquiring grace in your own room before an open window ten minutes each day he danced like a faun he introduced manner and style and atmosphere his words came trippingly upon his tongue and he waltzed twice in succession with the paper box girl that dempsey donovan brought dempsey was the leader of the association he wore a dress suit and could chin the bar twice with one hand he was one of big mike o sullivan s lieutenants and was never troubled by trouble no cop dared to arrest him whenever be broke a pushcart man s head or shot a member of the heinrick b sweeney outing and literary association in the kneecap an officer would drop around and say the cap n d like to see ye a few minutes round to the office whin ye have time dempsey me boy but there would be sundry gentlemen there with large gold fob chains and black cigars and somebody would tell a funny story and then dempsey would go back and work half an hour with the sixpound dumbbells so doing a tight rope act on a wire stretched across niagara was a safe terpsichorean performance compared with waltzing twice with dempsey donovan s paper box girl at o clock the jolly round face of big mike o sullivan shone at the door for five minutes upon the scene he always looked in for five minutes smiled at the girls and handed out real perfectos to the delighted boys dempsey donovan was at his elbow instantly talking rapidly big mike looked carefully at the dancers smiled shook his head and departed the music stopped the dancers scattered to the chairs along the walls terry o sullivan with his entrancing bow relinquished a pretty girl in blue to her partner and started back to find maggie dempsey intercepted him in the middle of the floor some fine instinct that rome must have bequeathed to us caused nearly every one to turn and look at them there was a subtle feeling that two gladiators had met in the arena two or three give and takes with tight coat sleeves drew nearer one moment mr o sullivan said dempsey i hope you re enjoying yourself where did you say you live the two gladiators were well matched dempsey had perhaps ten pounds of weight to give away the o sullivan had breadth with quickness dempsey had a glacial eye a dominating slit of a mouth an indestructible jaw a complexion like a belle s and the coolness of a champion the visitor showed more fire in his contempt and less control over his conspicuous sneer they were enemies by the law written when the rocks were molten they were each too splendid too mighty too incomparable to divide pre eminence one only must survive i live on grand said o sullivan insolently and no trouble to find me at home where do you live dempsey ignored the question you say your name s o sullivan he went on well big mike says he never saw you before lots of things he never saw said the favourite of the hop as a rule went on dempsey huskily sweet o sullivans in this district know one another you escorted one of our lady members here and we want chance to make good if you ve got a family tree let s see a few historical o sullivan buds come out on it or do you want us to dig it out of you by the roots suppose you mind your own business suggested o sullivan blandly dempsey s eye brightened he held up an inspired forefinger as though a brilliant idea had struck him i ve got it now he said cordially it was just a little mistake you ain t no o sullivan you are a ring tailed monkey excuse us for not recognising you at first o sullivan s eye flashed he made a quick movement but andy geoghan was ready and caught his arm dempsey nodded at andy and william mcmahan the secretary of the club and walked rapidly toward a door at the rear of the hall two other members of the give and take association swiftly joined the little group terry o sullivan was now in the hands of the board of rules and social referees they spoke to him briefly and softly and conducted him out through the same door at the rear this movement on the part of the clover leaf members requires a word of elucidation back of the association hall was a smaller room rented by the club in this room personal difficulties that arose on the ballroom floor were settled man to man with the weapons of nature under the supervision of the board no lady could say that she had witnessed a fight at a clover leaf hop in several years its gentlemen members guaranteed that so easily and smoothly had dempsey and the board done their preliminary work that many in the hall had not noticed the checking of the fascinating o sullivan s social triumph among these was maggie she looked about for her escort smoke up said rose cassidy wasn t you on demps donovan picked a scrap with your lizzie boy and they ve waltzed out to the slaughter room with him how s my hair look done up this way mag maggie laid a hand on the bosom of her cheesecloth waist gone to fight with dempsey she said breathlessly they ve got to be stopped dempsey donovan can t fight him why he ll he ll kill him ah what do you care said rosa don t some of em fight every hop but maggie was off darting her zig zag way through the maze of dancers she burst through the rear door into the dark hall and then threw her solid shoulder against the door of the room of single combat it gave way and in the instant that she entered her eye caught the scene the board standing about with open watches dempsey donovan in his shirt sleeves dancing light footed with the wary grace of the modern pugilist within easy reach of his adversary terry o sullivan standing with arms folded and a murderous look in his dark eyes and without slacking the speed of her entrance she leaped forward with a scream leaped in time to catch and hang upon the arm of o sullivan that was suddenly uplifted and to whisk from it the long bright stiletto that he had drawn from his bosom the knife fell and rang upon the floor cold steel drawn in the rooms of the give and take association such a thing had never happened before every one stood motionless for a minute andy geoghan kicked the stiletto with the toe of his shoe curiously like an antiquarian who has come upon some ancient weapon unknown to his learning and then o sullivan hissed something unintelligible between his teeth dempsey and the board exchanged looks and then dempsey looked at o sullivan without anger as one looks at a stray dog and nodded his head in the direction of the door the back stairs giuseppi he said briefly somebody pitch your hat down after you maggie walked up to dempsey donovan there was a brilliant spot of red in her cheeks down which slow tears were running but she looked him bravely in the eye i knew it dempsey she said as her eyes grew dull even in their tears i knew he was a guinea his name s tony spinelli i hurried in when they told me you and him was scrappin them guineas always carries knives but you don t understand dempsey i never had a fellow in my life i got tired of comin with anna and jimmy every night so i fixed it with him to call himself o sullivan and brought him along i knew there d be nothin doin for him if he came as a dago i guess i ll resign from the club now dempsey turned to andy geoghan chuck that cheese slicer out of the window he said and tell em inside that mr o sullivan has had a telephone message to go down to tammany hall and then he turned back to maggie say mag he said i ll see you home and how about next saturday night will you come to the hop with me if i call around for you it was remarkable how quickly maggie s eyes could change from dull to a shining brown with you dempsey she stammered say will a duck swim man about town there were two or three things that i wanted to know i do not care about a mystery so i began to inquire it took me two weeks to find out what women carry in dress suit cases and then i began to ask why a mattress is made in two pieces this serious query was at first received with suspicion because it sounded like a conundrum i was at last assured that its double form of construction was designed to make lighter the burden of woman who makes up beds i was so foolish as to persist begging to know why then they were not made in two equal pieces whereupon i was shunned the third draught that i craved from the fount of knowledge was enlightenment concerning the character known as a man about town he was more vague in my mind than a type should be we must have a concrete idea of anything even if it be an imaginary idea before we can comprehend it now i have a mental picture of john doe that is as clear as a steel engraving his eyes are weak blue he wears a brown vest and a shiny black serge coat he stands always in the sunshine chewing something and he keeps half shutting his pocket knife and opening it again with his thumb and if the man higher up is ever found take my assurance for it he will be a large pale man with blue wristlets showing under his cuffs and he will be sitting to have his shoes polisbed within sound of a bowling alley and there will be somewhere about him turquoises but the canvas of my imagination when it came to limning the man about town was blank i fancied that he bad a detachable sneer like the smile of the cheshire cat and attached cuffs and that was all whereupon i asked a newspaper reporter about him why said he a man about town something between a rounder and a clubman he isn t exactly well he fits in between mrs fish s receptions and private boxing bouts he doesn t well he doesn t belong either to the lotos club or to the jerry mcgeogheghan galvanised iron workers apprentices left hook chowder association i don t exactly know how to describe him to you you ll see him everywhere there s anything doing yes i suppose he s a type dress clothes every evening knows the ropes calls every policeman and waiter in town by their first names no he never travels with the hydrogen derivatives you generally see him alone or with another man my friend the reporter left me and i wandered further afield by this time the electric lights on the rialto were alight people passed but they held me not paphian eyes rayed upon me and left me unscathed diners heimgangers shop girls confidence men panhandlers actors highwaymen millionaires and outlanders hurried skipped strolled sneaked swaggered and scurried by me but i took no note of them i knew them all i had read their hearts they had served i wanted my man about town he was a type and to drop him would be an error a typograph but no let us continue let us continue with a moral digression to see a family reading the sunday paper gratifies the sections have been separated papa is earnestly scanning the page that pictures the young lady exercising before an open window and bending but there there mamma is interested in trying to guess the missing letters in the word nw yok the oldest girls are eagerly perusing the financial reports for a certain young man remarked last sunday night that he had taken a flyer in q x z willie the eighteen year old son who attends the new york public school is absorbed in the weekly article describing how to make over an old skirt for he hopes to take a prize in sewing on graduation day grandma is holding to the comic supplement with a two hours grip and little tottie the baby is rocking along the best she can with the real estatc transfers this view is intended to be reassuring for it is desirable that a few lines of this story be skipped for it introduces strong drink i went into a cafe to and while it was being mixed i asked the man who grabs up your hot scotch spoon as soon as you lay it down what he undcrstood by the term epithet description designation characterisation or appellation viz a man about town why said he carefully it means a fly guy that s wise to the all night push see it s a hot sport that you can t bump to the rail anywhere between the flatirons see i guess that s about what it means i thanked him and departed on the sidewalk a salvation lassie shook her contribution receptacle gently against my waistcoat pocket would you mind telling me i asked her if you ever meet with the character commonly denominated as a man about town during your daily wanderings i think i know whom you mean she answered with a gentle smile we see them in the same places night after night they are the devil s body guard and if the soldiers of any army are as faithful as they are their commanders are well served we go among them diverting a few pennies from their wickedness to the lord s service she shook the box again and i dropped a dime into it in front of a glittering hotel a friend of mine a critic was climbing from a cab he seemed at leisure and i put my question to him he answered me conscientiously as i was sure he would there is a type of man about town in new york he answered the term is quite familiar to me but i don t think i was ever called upon to define the character before it would be difficult to point you out an exact specimen i would say offhand that it is a man who had a hopeless case of the peculiar new york disease of wanting to see and know at o clock each day life begins with him he follows rigidly the conventions of dress and manners but in the business of poking his nose into places where he does not belong he could give pointers to a civet cat or a jackdaw he is the man who has chased bohemia about the town from rathskeller to roof garden and from hester street to harlem until you can t find a place in the city where they don t cut their spaghetti with a knife your man about town has done that he is always on the scent of something new he is curiosity impudence and omnipresence hansoms were made for him and gold banded cigars and the curse of music at dinner there are not so many of him but his minority report is adopted everywhere i m glad you brought up the subject i ve felt the influence of this nocturnal blight upon our city but i never thought to analyse it before i can see now that your man about town should havc been classified long ago in his wake spring up wine agents and cloak models and the orchestra p ays let s all go up to maud s for him by request instead of handel he makes his rounds every evening while you and i see the elephant once a week when the cigar store is raided he winks at the officer familiar with his ground and walks away immune while you and i search among the presidents for names and among the stars for addresses to give the desk sergeant my friend the critic paused to acquire breath for fresh eloquence i seized my advantage you have classified him i cried with joy you have painted his portrait in the gallery of city types but i must meet one face to face i must study the man about town at first hand where shall i find him how shall i know him without seeming to hear me the critic went on and his cab driver was waiting for his fare too he is the sublimated essence of butt in the refined intrinsic extract of rubber the concentrated purified irrefutable unavoidable spirit of curiosity and inquisitiveness a new sensation is the breath in his nostrils when his experience is exhausted he explores new fields with the indefatigability of a excuse me i interrupted but can you produce one of this type it is a new thing to me i must study it i will search the town over until i find one its habitat must be here on broadway i am about to dine here said my friend come inside and if there is a man about town present i will point him out to you i know most of the regular patrons here i am not dining yet i said to him you will excuse me i am going to find my man about town this night if i have to rake new york from the battery to little coney island i left the hotel and walked down broadway the pursuit of my type gave a pleasant savour of life and interest to the air i breathed i was glad to be in a city so great so complex and diversified leisurely and with something of an air i strolled along with my heart expanding at the thought that i was a citizen of great gotham a sharer in its magnificence and pleasures a partaker in its glory and prestige i turned to cross the street i heard something buzz like a bee and then i took a long pleasant ride with santos dumont when i opened my eyes i remembered a smell of gasoline and i said aloud hasn t it passed yet a hospital nurse laid a hand that was not particularly soft upon my brow that was not at all fevered a young doctor came along grinned and handed me a morning newspaper want to see how it happened he asked cheerily i read the article its headlines began where i heard the buzzing leave off the night before it closed with these lines bellevue hospital where it was said that his injuries were not serious he appeared to be a typica man about town the cop and the anthem on his bench in madison square soapy moved uneasily when wild geese honk high of nights and when women without sealskin coats grow kind to their husbands and when soapy moves uneasily on his bench in the park you may know that winter is near at hand a dead leaf fell in soapy s lap that was jack frost s card jack is kind to the regular denizens of madison square and gives fair warning of his annual call at the corners of four streets he hands his pasteboard to the north wind footman of the mansion of all outdoors so that the inhabitants thereof may make ready soapy s mind became cognisant of the fact that the time had come for him to resolve himself into a singular committee of ways and means to provide against the coming rigour and therefore he moved uneasily on his bench the hibernatorial ambitions of soapy were not of the highest in them there were no considerations of mediterranean cruises of soporific southern skies drifting in the vesuvian bay three months on the island was what his soul craved three months of assured board and bed and congenial company safe from boreas and bluecoats seemed to soapy the essence of things desirable for years the hospitable blackwell s had been his winter quarters just as his more fortunate fellow new yorkers had bought their tickets to palm beach and the riviera each winter so soapy had made his humble arrangements for his annual hegira to the island and now the time was come on the previous night three sabbath newspapers distributed beneath his coat about his ankles and over his lap had failed to repulse the cold as he slept on his bench near the spurting fountain in the ancient square so the island loomed big and timely in soapy s mind he scorned the provisions made in the name of charity for the city s dependents in soapy s opinion the law was more benign than philanthropy there was an endless round of institutions municipal and eleemosynary on which he might set out and receive lodging and food accordant with the simple life but to one of soapy s proud spirit the gifts of charity are encumbered if not in coin you must pay in humiliation of spirit for every benefit received at the hands of philanthropy as caesar had his brutus every bed of charity must have its toll of a bath every loaf of bread its compensation of a private and personal inquisition wherefore it is better to be a guest of the law which though conducted by rules does not meddle unduly with a gentleman s private affairs soapy having decided to go to the island at once set about accomplishing his desire there were many easy ways of doing this the pleasantest was to dine luxuriously at some expensive restaurant and then after declaring insolvency be handed over quietly and without uproar to a policeman an accommodating magistrate would do the rest soapy left his bench and strolled out of the square and across the level sea of asphalt where broadway and fifth avenue flow together up broadway he turned and halted at a glittering cafe where are gathered together nightly the choicest products of the grape the silkworm and the protoplasm soapy had confidence in himself from the lowest button of his vest upward he was shaven and his coat was decent and his neat black ready tied four in hand had been presented to him by a lady missionary on thanksgiving day if he could reach a table in the restaurant unsuspected success would be his the portion of him that would show above the table would raise no doubt in the waiter s mind a roasted mallard duck thought soapy would be about the thing with a bottle of chablis and then camembert a demi tasse and a cigar one dollar for the cigar would be enough the total would not be so high as to call forth any supreme manifestation of revenge from the cafe management and yet the meat would leave him filled and happy for the journey to his winter refuge but as soapy set foot inside the restaurant door the head waiter s eye fell upon his frayed trousers and decadent shoes strong and ready hands turned him about and conveyed him in silence and haste to the sidewalk and averted the ignoble fate of the menaced mallard soapy turned off broadway it seemed that his route to the coveted island was not to be an epicurean one some other way of entering limbo must be thought of at a corner of sixth avenue electric lights and cunningly displayed wares behind plate glass made a shop window conspicuous soapy took a cobblestone and dashed it through the glass people came running around the corner a policeman in the lead soapy stood still with his hands in his pockets and smiled at the sight of brass buttons where s the man that done that inquired the officer excitedly don t you figure out that i might have had something to do with it said soapy not without sarcasm but friendly as one greets good fortune the policeman s mind refused to accept soapy even as a clue men who smash windows do not remain to parley with the law s minions they take to their heels the policeman saw a man half way down the block running to catch a car with drawn club he joined in the pursuit soapy with disgust in his heart loafed along twice unsuccessful on the opposite side of the street was a restaurant of no great pretensions it catered to large appetites and modest purses its crockery and atmosphere were thick its soup and napery thin into this place soapy took his accusive shoes and telltale trousers without challenge at a table he sat and consumed beefsteak flapjacks doughnuts and pie and then to the waiter be betrayed the fact that the minutest coin and himself were strangers now get busy and call a cop said soapy and don t keep a gentleman waiting no cop for youse said the waiter with a voice like butter cakes and an eye like the cherry in a manhattan cocktail hey con neatly upon his left ear on the callous pavement two waiters pitched soapy he arose joint by joint as a carpenter s rule opens and beat the dust from his clothes arrest seemed but a rosy dream the island seemed very far away a policeman who stood before a drug store two doors away laughed and walked down the street five blocks soapy travelled before his courage permitted him to woo capture again this time the opportunity presented what he fatuously termed to himself a cinch a young woman of a modest and pleasing guise was standing before a show window gazing with sprightly interest at its display of shaving mugs and inkstands and two yards from the window a large policeman of severe demeanour leaned against a water plug it was soapy s design to assume the role of the despicable and execrated masher the refined and elegant appearance of his victim and the contiguity of the conscientious cop encouraged him to believe that he would soon feel the pleasant official clutch upon his arm that would insure his winter quarters on the right little tight little isle soapy straightened the lady missionary s readymade tie dragged his shrinking cuffs into the open set his hat at a killing cant and sidled toward the young woman he made eyes at her was taken with sudden coughs and hems smiled smirked and went brazenly through the impudent and contemptible litany of the masher with half an eye soapy saw that the policeman was watching him fixedly the young woman moved away a few steps and again bestowed her absorbed attention upon the shaving mugs soapy followed boldly stepping to her side raised his hat and said ah there bedelia don t you want to come and play in my yard the policeman was still looking the persecuted young woman had but to beckon a finger and soapy would be practically en route for his insular haven already he imagined he could feel the cozy warmth of the station house the young woman faced him and stretching out a hand caught soapy s coat sleeve sure mike she said joyfully if you ll blow me to a pail of suds i d have spoke to you sooner but the cop was watching with the young woman playing the clinging ivy to his oak soapy walked past the policeman overcome with gloom he seemed doomed to liberty at the next corner he shook off his companion and ran he halted in the district where by night are found the lightest streets hearts vows and librettos women in furs and men in greatcoats moved gaily in the wintry air a sudden fear seized soapy that some dreadful enchantment had rendered him immune to arrest the thought brought a little of panic upon it and when he came upon another policeman lounging grandly in front of a transplendent theatre he caught at the immediate straw of disorderly conduct on the sidewalk soapy began to yell drunken gibberish at the top of his harsh voice he danced howled raved and otherwise disturbed the welkin the policeman twirled his club turned his back to soapy and remarked to a citizen tis one of them yale lads celebratin the goose egg they give to the hartford college noisy but no harm we ve instructions to lave them be disconsolate soapy ceased his unavailing racket would never a policeman lay hands on him in his fancy the island seemed an unattainable arcadia he buttoned his thin coat against the chilling wind in a cigar store he saw a well dressed man lighting a cigar at a swinging light his silk umbrella he had set by the door on entering soapy stepped inside secured the umbrella and sauntered off with it slowly the man at the cigar light followed hastily my umbrella he said sternly oh is it sneered soapy adding insult to petit larceny well why don t you call a policeman i took it your umbrella why don t you call a cop there stands one on the corner the umbrella owner slowed his steps soapy did likewise with a presentiment that luck would again run against him the policeman looked at the two curiously of course said the umbrella man that is well you know how these mistakes occur i if it s your umbrella i hope you ll excuse me i picked it up this morning in a restaurant if you recognise it as yours why i hope you ll of course it s mine said soapy viciously the ex umbrella man retreated the policeman hurried to assist a tall blonde in an opera cloak across the street in front of a street car that was approaching two blocks away soapy walked eastward through a street damaged by improvements he hurled the umbrella wrathfully into an excavation he muttered against the men who wear helmets and carry clubs because he wanted to fall into their clutches they seemed to regard him as a king who could do no wrong at length soapy reached one of the avenues to the east where the glitter and turmoil was but faint he set his face down this toward madison square for the homing instinct survives even when the home is a park bench but on an unusually quiet corner soapy came to a standstill here was an old church quaint and rambling and gabled through one violet stained window a soft light glowed where no doubt the organist loitered over the keys making sure of his mastery of the coming sabbath anthem for there drifted out to soapy s ears sweet music that caught and held him transfixed against the convolutions of the iron fence the moon was above lustrous and serene vehicles and pedestrians were few sparrows twittered sleepily in the eaves for a little while the scene might have been a country churchyard and the anthem that the organist played cemented soapy to the iron fence for he had known it well in the days when his life contained such things as mothers and roses and ambitions and friends and immaculate thoughts and collars the conjunction of soapy s receptive state of mind and the influences about the old church wrought a sudden and wonderful change in his soul he viewed with swift horror the pit into which he had tumbled the degraded days unworthy desires dead hopes wrecked faculties and base motives that made up his existence and also in a moment his heart responded thrillingly to this novel mood an instantaneous and strong impulse moved him to battle with his desperate fate he would pull himself out of the mire he would make a man of himself again he would conquer the evil that had taken possession of him there was time he was comparatively young yet he would resurrect his old eager ambitions and pursue them without faltering those solemn but sweet organ notes had set up a revolution in him to morrow he would go into the roaring downtown district and find work a fur importer had once offered him a place as driver he would find him to morrow and ask for the position he would be somebody in the world he would soapy felt a hand laid on his arm he looked quickly around into the broad face of a policeman what are you doin here asked the officer nothin said soapy then come along said the policeman three months on the island said the magistrate in the police court the next morning an adjustment of nature in an art exhibition the other day i saw a painting that had been sold for the painter was a young scrub out of the west named kraft who had a favourite food and a pet theory his pabulum was an unquenchable belief in the unerring artistic adjustment of nature his theory was fixed around corned beef hash with poached egg there was a story behind the picture so i went home and let it drip out of a fountain pen the idea of kraft but that is not the beginning of the story three years ago kraft bill judkins a poet and i took our meals at cypher s on eighth avenue i say took when we had money cypher got it off of us as he expressed it we had no credit we went in called for food and ate it we paid or we did not pay we had confidence in cypher s sullenness end smouldering ferocity deep down in his sunless soul he was either a prince a fool or an artist he sat at a worm eaten desk covered with files of waiters checks so old that i was sure the bottomest one was for clams that hendrik hudson had eaten and paid for cypher had the power in common with napoleon iii and the goggle eyed perch of throwing a film over his eyes rendering opaque the windows of his soul once when we left him unpaid with egregious excuses i looked back and saw him shaking with inaudible laughter behind his film now and then we paid up back scores but the chief thing at cypher s was milly milly was a waitress she was a grand example of kraft s theory of the artistic adjustment of nature she belonged largely to waiting as minerva did to the art of scrapping or venus to the science of serious flirtation pedestalled and in bronze she might have stood with the noblest of her heroic sisters as liver and bacon enlivening the world she belonged to cypher s you expected to see her colossal figure loom through that reeking blue cloud of smoke from frying fat just as you expect the palisades to appear through a drifting hudson river fog there amid the steam of vegetables and the vapours of acres of ham and the crash of crockery the clatter of steel the screaming of short orders the cries of the hungering and all the horrid tumult of feeding man surrounded by swarms of the buzzing winged beasts bequeathed us by pharaoh milly steered her magnificent way like some great liner cleaving among the canoes of howling savages our goddess of grub was built on lines so majestic that they could be followed only with awe her sleeves were always rolled above her elbows she could have taken us three musketeers in her two hands and dropped us out of the window she had seen fewer years than any of us but she was of such superb evehood and simplicity that she mothered us from the beginning cypher s store of eatables she poured out upon us with royal indifference to price and quantity as from a cornucopia that knew no exhaustion her voice rang like a great silver bell her smile was many toothed and frequent she seemed like a yellow sunrise on mountain tops i never saw her but i thought of the yosemite and yet somehow i could never think of her as existing outside of cypher s there nature had placed her and she had taken root and grown mightily she seemed happy and took her few poor dollars on saturday nights with the flushed pleasure of a child that receives an unexpected donation it was kraft who first voiced the fear that each of us must have held latently it came up apropos of course of certain questions of art at which we were hammering one of us compared the harmony existing between a haydn symphony and pistache ice cream to the exquisite congruity between milly and cypher s there is a certain fate hanging over milly said kraft and if it overtakes her she is lost to cypher s and to us she will grow fat asked judkins fearsomely she will go to night school and become refined i ventured anxiously it is this said kraft punctuating in a puddle of spilled coffee with a stiff forefinger caesar had his brutus the cotton has its boliworm the chorus girl has her pittsburger the summer boarder has his poison ivy the hero has his carnegie medal art has its morgan the rose has its speak i interrupted much perturbed you do not think that milly will begin to lace one day concluded kraft solemnly there will come to cypher s for a plate of beans a millionaire lumberman from wisconsin and he will marry milly never exclaimed judkins and t in horror a lumberman repeated kraft hoarsely and a millionaire lumberman i sighed despairingly from wisconsin groaned judkins we agreed that the awful fate seemed to menace her few things were less improbable milly like some vast virgin stretch of pine woods was made to catch the lumberman s eye and well we knew the habits of the badgers once fortune smiled upon them straight to new york they hie and lay their goods at the feet of the girl who serves them beans in a beanery why the alphabet itself connives the sunday newspaper s headliner s work is cut for him winsome waitress wins wealthy wisconsin woodsman for a while we felt that milly was on the verge of being lost to us it was our love of the unerring artistic adjustment of nature that inspired us we could not give her over to a lumberman doubly accursed by wealth and provincialism we shuddered to think of milly with her voice modulated and her elbows covered pouring tea in the marble teepee of a tree murderer no in cypher s she belonged in the bacon smoke the cabbage perfume the grand wagnerian chorus of hurled ironstone china and rattling casters our fears must have been prophetic for on that same evening the wildwood discharged upon us milly s preordained confiscator our fee to adjustment and order but alaska and not wisconsin bore the burden of the visitation we were at our supper of beef stew and dried apples when he trotted in as if on the heels of a dog team and made one of the mess at our table with the freedom of the camps he assaulted our ears and claimed the fellowship of men lost in the wilds of a hash house we embraced him as a specimen and in three minutes we had all but died for one another as friends he was rugged and bearded and wind dried he had just come off the trail he said at one of the north river ferries i fancied i could see the snow dust of chilcoot yet powdering his shoulders and then he strewed the table with the nuggets stuffed ptarmigans bead work and seal pelts of the returned kiondiker and began to prate to us of his millions bank drafts for two millions was his summing up and a thousand a day piling up from my claims and now i want some beef stew and canned peaches i never got off the train since i mushed out of seattle and i m hungry the stuff the niggers feed you on pullmans don t count you gentlemen order what you want and then milly loomed up with a thousand dishes on her bare arm loomed up big and white and pink and awful as mount saint elias with a smile like day breaking in a gulch and the kiondiker threw down his pelts and nuggets as dross and let his jaw fall half way and stared at her you could almost see the diamond tiaras on milly s brow and the hand embroidered silk paris gowns that he meant to buy for her at last the bollworm had attacked the cotton the poison ivy was reaching out its tendrils to entwine the summer boarder the millionaire lumberman thinly disguised as the alaskan miner was about to engulf our milly and upset nature s adjustment kraft was the first to act he leaped up and pounded the klondiker s back come out and drink he shouted drink first and eat afterward judkins seized one arm and i the other gaily roaringly irresistibly in jolly good fellow style we dragged him from the restaurant to a cafe stuffing his pockets with his embalmed birds and indigestible nuggets there he rumbled a roughly good humoured protest that s the girl for my money he declared she can eat out of my skillet the rest of her life why i never see such a fine girl i m going back there and ask her to marry me i guess she won t want to sling hash any more when she sees the pile of dust i ve got you ll take another whiskey and milk now kraft persuaded with satan s smile i thought you up country fellows were better sports kraft spent his puny store of coin at the bar and then gave judkins and me such an appealing look that we went down to the last dime we had in toasting our guest then when our ammunition was gone and the klondiker still somewhat sober began to babble again of milly kraft whispered into his ear such a polite barbed insult relating to people who were miserly with their funds that the miner crashed down handful after handful of silver and notes calling for all the fluids in the world to drown the imputation thus the work was accomplished with his own guns we drove him from the field and then we had him carted to a distant small hotel and put to bed with his nuggets and baby seal skins stuffed around him he will never find cypher s again said kraft he will propose to the first white apron he sees in a dairy restaurant to morrow and milly i mean the natural adjustment is saved and back to cypher s went we three and finding customers scarce we joined hands and did an indian dance with milly in the centre this i say happened three years ago and about that time a little luck descended upon us three and we were enabled to buy costlier and less wholesome food than cypher s our paths separated and i saw kraft no more and judkins seldom but as i said i saw a painting the other day that was sold for the title was boadicea and the figure seemed to fill all out of doors but of all the picture s admirers who stood before it i believe i was the only one who longed for boadicea to stalk from her frame bringing me corned beef hash with poached egg i hurried away to see kraft his satanic eyes were the same his hair was worse tangled but his clothes had been made by a tailor i didn t know i said to him we ve bought a cottage in the bronx with the money said he any evening at then said i when you led us against the lumberman the klondiker it wasn t altogether on account of the unerring artistic adjustment of nature well not altogether said kraft with a grin memoirs of a yellow dog i don t suppose it will knock any of you people off your perch to read a contribution from an animal mr kipling and a good many others have demonstrated the fact that animals can express themselves in remunerative english and no magazine goes to press nowadays without an animal story in it except the old style monthlies that are still running pictures of bryan and the mont pelee horror but you needn t look for any stuck up literature in my piece such as bearoo the bear and snakoo the snake and tammanoo the tiger talk in the jungle books a yellow dog that s spent most of his life in a cheap new york flat sleeping in a corner on an old sateen underskirt the one she spilled port wine on at the lady longshoremen s banquet mustn t be expcctcd to perform any tricks with the art of speech i was born a yellow pup date locality pedigree and weight unknown the first thing i can recollect an old woman had me in a basket at broadway and twenty third trying to sell me to a fat lady old mother hubbard was boosting me to beat the band as a genuine pomeranian hambletonian red irish cochin china stoke pogis fox terrier the fat lady chased a v around among the samples of gros grain flannelette in her shopping bag till she cornered it and gave up from that moment i was a pet a mamma s own wootsey squidlums say gentle reader did you ever have a pound woman breathing a flavour of camembert cheese and peau d espagne pick you up and wallop her nose all over you remarking all the time in an emma eames tone of voice oh oo s um oodlum doodlum woodlum toodlum bitsy witsy skoodlums from a pedigreed yellow pup i grew up to be an anonymous yellow cur looking like a cross between an angora cat and a box of lemons but my mistress never tumbled she thought that the two primeval pups that noah chased into the ark were but a collateral branch of my ancestors it took two policemen to keep her from entering me at the madison square garden for the siberian bloodhound prize i ll tell you about that flat the house was the ordinary thing in new york paved with parian marble in the entrance hall and cobblestones above the first floor our fiat was three well not flights climbs up my mistress rented it unfurnished and put in the regular things antique unholstered parlour set oil chromo of geishas in a harlem tea house rubber plant and husband by sirius there was a biped i felt sorry for he was a little man with sandy hair and whiskers a good deal like mine henpecked well toucans and flamingoes and pelicans all had their bills in him he wiped the dishes and listened to my mistress tell about the cheap ragged things the lady with the squirrel skin coat on the second floor hung out on her line to dry and every evening while she was getting supper she made him take me out on the end of a string for a walk if men knew how women pass the time when they are alone they d never marry laura lean jibbey peanut brittle a little almond cream on the neck muscles dishes unwashed half an hour s talk with the iceman reading a package of old letters a couple of pickles and two bottles of malt extract one hour peeking through a hole in the window shade into the flat across the air shaft that s about all there is to it twenty minutes before time for him to come home from work she straightens up the house fixes her rat so it won t show and gets out a lot of sewing for a ten minute bluff i led a dog s life in that flat most all day i lay there in my corner watching that fat woman kill time i slept sometimes and had pipe dreams about being out chasing cats into basements and growling at old ladies with black mittens as a dog was intended to do then she would pounce upon me with a lot of that drivelling poodle palaver and kiss me on the nose but what could i do a dog can t chew cloves i began to feel sorry for hubby dog my cats if i didn t we looked so much alike that people noticed it when we went out so we shook the streets that morgan s cab drives down and took to climbing the piles of last december s snow on the streets where cheap people live one evening when we were thus promenading and i was trying to look like a prize st bernard and the old man was trying to look like he wouldn t have murdered the first organ grinder he heard play mendelssohn s wedding march i looked up at him and said in my way what are you looking so sour about you oakum trimmed lobster she don t kiss you you don t have to sit on her lap and listen to talk that would make the book of a musical comedy sound like the maxims of epictetus you ought to be thankful you re not a dog brace up benedick and bid the blues begone the matrimonial mishap looked down at me with almost canine intelligence in his face why doggie says he good doggie you almost look like you could speak what is it doggie cats cats could speak but of course he couldn t understand humans were denied the speech of animals the only common ground of communication upon which dogs and men can get together is in fiction in the flat across the hall from us lived a lady with a black and tan terrier her husband strung it and took it out every evening but he always came home cheerful and whistling one day i touched noses with the black and tan in the hall and i struck him for an elucidation see here wiggle and skip i says you know that it ain t the nature of a real man to play dry nurse to a dog in public i never saw one leashed to a bow wow yet that didn t look like he d like to lick every other man that looked at him but your boss comes in every day as perky and set up as an amateur prestidigitator doing the egg trick how does he do it don t tell me he likes it him says the black and tan why he uses nature s own remedy he gets spifflicated at first when we go out he s as shy as the man on the steamer who would rather play pedro when they make em all jackpots by the time we ve been in eight saloons he don t care whether the thing on the end of his line is a dog or a catfish i ve lost two inches of my tail trying to sidestep those swinging doors the pointer i got from that terrier vaudeville please copy set me to thinking one evening about o clock my mistress ordered him to get busy and do the ozone act for lovey i have concealed it until now but that is what she called me the black and tan was called tweetness i consider that i have the bulge on him as far as you could chase a rabbit still lovey is something of a nomenclatural tin can on the tail of one s self respect at a quiet place on a safe street i tightened the line of my custodian in front of an attractive refined saloon i made a dead ahead scramble for the doors whining like a dog in the press despatches that lets the family know that little alice is bogged while gathering lilies in the brook why darn my eyes says the old man with a grin darn my eyes if the saffron coloured son of a seltzer lemonade ain t asking me in to take a drink lemme see how long s it been since i saved shoe leather by keeping one foot on the foot rest i believe i ll i knew i had him hot scotches he took sitting at a table for an hour he kept the campbells coming i sat by his side rapping for the waiter with my tail and eating free lunch such as mamma in her flat never equalled with her homemade truck bought at a delicatessen store eight minutes before papa comes home when the products of scotland were all exhausted except the rye bread the old man unwound me from the table leg and played me outside like a fisherman plays a salmon out there he took off my collar and threw it into the street poor doggie says he good doggie she shan t kiss you any more s a darned shame good doggie go away and get run over by a street car and be happy i refused to leave i leaped and frisked around the old man s legs happy as a pug on a rug you old flea headed woodchuck chaser i said to him you moon baying rabbit pointing eggstealing old beagle can t you see that i don t want to leave you can t you see that we re both pups in the wood and the missis is the cruel uncle after you with the dish towel and me with the flea liniment and a pink bow to tie on my tail why not cut that all out and be pards forever more maybe you ll say he didn t understand maybe he didn t but he kind of got a grip on the hot scotches and stood still for a minute thinking doggie says he finally we don t live more than a dozen lives on this earth and very few of us live to be more than if i ever see that flat any more i m a flat and if you do you re flatter and that s no flattery i m offering to that westward ho wins out by the length of a dachshund there was no string but i frolicked along with my master to the twenty third street ferry and the cats on the route saw reason to give thanks that prehensile claws had been given them on the jersey side my master said to a stranger who stood eating a currant bun me and my doggie we are bound for the rocky mountains but what pleased me most was when my old man pulled both of my ears until i howled and said you common monkey headed rat tailed sulphur coloured son of a door mat do you know what i m going to call you i thought of lovey and i whined dolefully i m going to call you pete says my master and if i d had five tails i couldn t have done enough wagging to do justice to the occasion the love philtre of ikey schoenstein the blue light drug store is downtown between the bowery and first avenue where the distance between the two streets is the shortest the blue light does not consider that pharmacy is a thing of bric a brac scent and ice cream soda if you ask it for pain killer it will not give you a bonbon the blue light scorns the labour saving arts of modern pharmacy it macerates its opium and percolates its own laudanum and paregoric to this day pills are made behind its tall prcscription desk pills rolled out on its own pill tile divided with a spatula rolled with the finger and thumb dusted with calcined magnesia and delivered in little round pasteboard pill boxes the store is on a corner about which coveys of ragged plumed hilarious children play and become candidates for the cough drops and soothing syrups that wait for them inside ikey schoenstein was the night clerk of the blue light and the friend of his customers thus it is on the east side where the heart of pharmacy is not g ace there as it should be the druggist is a counsellor a confessor an adviser an able and willing missionary and mentor whose learning is respected whose occult wisdom is venerated and whose medicine is often poured untasted into the gutter therefore ikey s corniform be spectacled nose and narrow knowledge bowed figure was well known in the vicinity of the blue light and his advice and notice were much desired ikey roomed and breakfasted at mrs riddle s two squares away mrs riddle had a daughter named rosy the circumlocution has been in vain you must have guessed it ikey adored rosy she tinctured all his thoughts she was the compound extract of all that was chemically pure and officinal the dispensatory contained nothing equal to her but ikey was timid and his hopes remained insoluble in the menstruum of his backwardness and fears behind his counter he was a superior being calmly conscious of special knowledge and worth outside he was a weak kneed purblind motorman cursed rambler with ill fitting clothes stained with chemicals and smelling of socotrine aloes and valerianate of ammonia the fly in ikey s ointment thrice welcome pat trope was chunk mcgowan mr mcgowan was also striving to catch the bright smiles tossed about by rosy but he was no outfielder as ikey was he picked them off the bat at the same time he was ikey s friend and customer and often dropped in at the blue light drug store to have a bruise painted with iodine or get a cut rubber plastered after a pleasant evening spent along the bowery one afternoon mcgowan drifted in in his silent easy way and sat comely smooth faced hard indomitable good natured upon a stool ikey said he when his friend had fetched his mortar and sat opposite grinding gum benzoin to a powder get busy with your ear it s drugs for me if you ve got the line i need ikey scanned the countenance of mr mcgowan for the usual evidences of conflict but found none take your coat off he ordered i guess already that you have been stuck in the ribs with a knife i have many times told you those dagoes would do you up mr mcgowan smiled not them he said not any dagoes but you ve located the diagnosis all right enough it s under my coat near the ribs say ikey rosy and me are goin to run away and get married to night ikey s left forefinger was doubled over the edge of the mortar holding it steady he gave it a wild rap with the pestle but felt it not meanwhile mr mcgowan s smile faded to a look of perplexed gloom that is he continued if she keeps in the notion until the time comes we ve been layin pipes for the getaway for two weeks one day she says she will the same evenin she says nixy we ve agreed on to night and rosy s stuck to the affirmative this time for two whole days but it s five hours yet till the time and i m afraid she ll stand me up when it comes to the scratch you said you wanted drugs remarked ikey mr mcgowan looked ill at ease and harassed a condition opposed to his usual line of demeanour he made a patent medicine almanac into a roll and fitted it with unprofitable carefulness about his finger i wouldn t have this double handicap make a false start to night for a million he said i ve got a little flat up in harlem all ready with chrysanthemums on the table and a kettle ready to boil and i ve engaged a pulpit pounder to be ready at his house for us at it s got to come off and if rosy don t change her mind again mr mcgowan ceased a prey to his doubts i don t see then yet said ikey shortly what makes it that you talk of drugs or what i can be doing about it old man riddle don t like me a little bit went on the uneasy suitor bent upon marshalling his arguments for a week he hasn t let rosy step outside the door with me if it wasn t for losin a boarder they d have bounced me long ago i m makin a week and she ll never regret flyin the coop with chunk mcgowan you will excuse me chunk said ikey i must make a prescription that is to be called for soon say said mcgowan looking up suddenly say ikey ain t there a drug of some kind some kind of powders that ll make a girl like you better if you give em to her ikey s lip beneath his nose curled with the scorn of superior enlightenment but before he could answer mcgowan continued tim lacy told me he got some once from a croaker uptown and fed em to his girl in soda water from the very first dose he was ace high and everybody else looked like thirty cents to her they was married in less than two weeks strong and simple was chunk mcgowan a better reader of men than ikey was could have seen that his tough frame was strung upon fine wires like a good general who was about to invade the enemy s territory he was seeking to guard every point against possible failure i thought went on chunk hopefully that if i had one of them powders to give rosy when i see her at supper to night it might brace her up and keep her from reneging on the proposition to skip i guess she don t need a mule team to drag her away but women are better at coaching than they are at running bases if the stuff ll work just for a couple of hours it ll do the trick when is this foolishness of running away to be happening asked ikey nine o clock said mr mcgowan supper s at seven at eight rosy goes to bed with a headache at nine old parvenzano lets me through to his back yard where there s a board off riddle s fence next door i go under her window and help her down the fire escape we ve got to make it early on the preacher s account it s all dead easy if rosy don t balk when the flag drops can you fix me one of them powders ikey ikey schoenstein rubbed his nose slowly chunk said he it is of drugs of that nature that pharmaceutists must have much carefulness to you alone of my acquaintance would i intrust a powder like that but for you i shall make it and you shall see how it makes rosy to think of you ikey went behind the prescription desk there he crushed to a powder two soluble tablets each containing a quarter of a grain of morphia to them he added a little sugar of milk to increase the bulk and folded the mixture neatly in a white paper taken by an adult this powder would insure several hours of heavy slumber without danger to the sleeper this he handed to chunk mcgowan telling him to administer it in a liquid if possible and received the hearty thanks of the backyard lochinvar the subtlety of ikey s action becomes apparent upon recital of his subsequent move he sent a messenger for mr riddle and disclosed the plans of mr mcgowan for eloping with rosy mr riddle was a stout man brick dusty of complexion and sudden in action much obliged he said briefly to ikey the lazy irish loafer my own room s just above rosy s i ll just go up there myself after supper and load the shot gun and wait if he comes in my back yard he ll go away in a ambulance instead of a bridal chaise with rosy held in the clutches of morpheus for a many hours deep slumber and the bloodthirsty parent waiting armed and forewarned ikey felt that his rival was close indeed upon discomfiture all night in the blue light drug store he waited at his duties for chance news of the tragedy but none came at eight o clock in the morning the day clerk arrived and ikey started hurriedly for mrs riddle s to learn the outcome and lo as he stepped out of the store who but chunk mcgowan sprang from a passing street car and grasped his hand chunk mcgowan with a victor s smile and flushed with joy pulled it off said chunk with elysium in his grin rosy bit the fire escape on time to a second and we was under the wire at the reverend s at o she s up at the flat she cooked eggs this mornin in a blue kimono lord how lucky i am you must pace up some day ikey and feed with us i ve got a job down near the bridge and that s where i m heading for now the the powder stammered ikey oh that stuff you gave me said chunk broadening his grin well it was this way i sat down at the supper table last night at riddle s and i looked at rosy and i says to myself chunk if you get the girl get her on the square don t try any hocus pocus with a thoroughbred like her and i keeps the paper you give me in my pocket and then my lamps fall on another party present who i says to myself is failin in a proper affection toward his comin son in law so i watches my chance and dumps that powder in old man riddle s coffee see mammon and the archer old anthony rockwall retired manufacturer and proprietor of rockwall s eureka soap looked out the library window of his fifth avenue mansion and grinned his neighbour to the right the aristocratic clubman g van schuylight suffolk jones came out to his waiting motor car wrinkling a contumelious nostril as usual at the italian renaissance sculpture of the soap palace s front elevation stuck up old statuette of nothing doing commented the ex soap king the eden musee ll get that old frozen nesselrode yet if he don t watch out i ll have this house painted red white and blue next summer and see if that ll make his dutch nose turn up any higher and then anthony rockwall who never cared for bells went to the door of his library and shouted mike in the same voice that had once chipped off pieces of the welkin on the kansas prairies tell my son said anthony to the answering menial to come in here before he leaves the house when young rockwall entered the library the old man laid aside his newspaper looked at him with a kindly grimness on his big smooth ruddy countenance rumpled his mop of white hair with one hand and rattled the keys in his pocket with the other richard said anthony rockwail what do you pay for the soap that you use richard only six months home from college was startled a little he had not yet taken the measure of this sire of his who was as full of unexpectednesses as a girl at her first party six dollars a dozen i think dad and your clothes i suppose about sixty dollars as a rule you re a gentleman said anthony decidedly i ve heard of these young bloods spending a dozen for soap and going over the hundred mark for clothes you ve got as much money to waste as any of em and yet you stick to what s decent and moderate now i use the old eureka not only for sentiment but it s the purest soap made whenever you pay more than cents a cake for soap you buy bad perfumes and labels but cents is doing very well for a young man in your generation position and condition as i said you re a gentleman they say it takes three generations to make one they re off money ll do it as slick as soap grease it s made you one by hokey it s almost made one of me i m nearly as impolite and disagreeable and ill mannered as these two old knickerbocker gents on each side of me that can t sleep of nights because i bought in between em there are some things that money can t accomplish remarked young rockwall rather gloomily now don t say that said old anthony shocked i bet my money on money every time i ve been through the encyclopaedia down to y looking for something you can t buy with it and i expect to have to take up the appendix next week i m for money against the field tell me something money won t buy for one thing answered richard rankling a little it won t buy one into the exclusive circles of society oho won t it thundered the champion of the root of evil you tell me where your exclusive circles would be if the first astor hadn t had the money to pay for his steerage passage over richard sighed and that s what i was coming to said the old man less boisterously that s why i asked you to come in there s something going wrong with you boy i ve been noticing it for two weeks out with it i guess i could lay my hands on eleven millions within twenty four hours besides the real estate if it s your liver there s the rambler down in the bay coaled and ready to steam down to the bahamas in two days not a bad guess dad you haven t missed it far ah said anthony keenly what s her name richard began to walk up and down the library floor there was enough comradeship and sympathy in this crude old father of his to draw his confidence why don t you ask her demanded old anthony she ll jump at you you ve got the money and the looks and you re a decent boy your hands are clean you ve got no eureka soap on em you ve been to college but she ll overlook that i haven t had a chance said richard make one said anthony take her for a walk in the park or a straw ride or walk home with her from church chance pshaw you don t know the social mill dad she s part of the stream that turns it every hour and minute of her time is arranged for days in advance i must have that girl dad or this town is a blackjack swamp forevermore and i can t write it i can t do that tut said the old man do you mean to tell me that with all the money i ve got you can t get an hour or two of a girl s time for yourself i ve put it off too late she s going to sail for europe at noon day after to morrow for a two years stay i m to see her alone to morrow evening for a few minutes she s at larchmont now at her aunt s i can t go there but i m allowed to meet her with a cab at the grand central station to morrow evening at the train we drive down broadway to wallack s at a gallop where her mother and a box party will be waiting for us in the lobby do you think she would listen to a declaration from me during that six or eight minutes under those circumstances no and what chance would i have in the theatre or afterward none no dad this is one tangle that your money can t unravel we can t buy one minute of time with cash if we could rich people would live longer there s no hope of getting a talk with miss lantry before she sails all right richard my boy said old anthony cheerfully you may run along down to your club now i m glad it ain t your liver but don t forget to burn a few punk sticks in the joss house to the great god mazuma from time to time you say money won t buy time well of course you can t order eternity wrapped up and delivered at your residence for a price but i ve seen father time get pretty bad stone bruises on his heels when he walked through the gold diggings that night came aunt ellen gentle sentimental wrinkled sighing oppressed by wealth in to brother anthony at his evening paper and began discourse on the subject of lovers woes he told me all about it said brother anthony yawning i told him my bank account was at his service and then he began to knock money said money couldn t help said the rules of society couldn t be bucked for a yard by a team of ten millionaires oh anthony sighed aunt ellen i wish you would not think so much of money wealth is nothing where a true affection is concerned love is all powerful if he only had spoken earlier she could not have refused our richard but now i fear it is too late he will have no opportunity to address her all your gold cannot bring happiness to your son at eight o clock the next evening aunt ellen took a quaint old gold ring from a moth eaten case and gave it to richard wear it to night nephew she begged your mother gave it to me good luck in love she said it brought she asked me to give it to you when you had found the one you loved young rockwall took the ring reverently and tried it on his smallest finger it slipped as far as the second joint and stopped he took it off and stuffed it into his vest pocket after the manner of man and then he phoned for his cab at the station he captured miss lantry out of the gadding mob at eight thirty two we mustn t keep mamma and the others waiting said she to wallack s theatre as fast as you can drive said richard loyally they whirled up forty second to broadway and then down the white starred lane that leads from the soft meadows of sunset to the rocky hills of morning at thirty fourth street young richard quickly thrust up the trap and ordered the cabman to stop i ve dropped a ring he apo ogised as he climbed out it was my mother s and i d hate to lose it i won t detain you a minute i saw where it fell in less than a minute he was back in the cab with the ring but within that minute a crosstown car had stopped directly in front of the cab the cabman tried to pass to the left but a heavy express wagon cut him off he tried the right and had to back away from a furniture van that had no business to be there he tried to back out but dropped his reins and swore dutifully he was blockaded in a tangled mess of vehicles and horses one of those street blockades had occurred that sometimes tie up commerce and movement quite suddenly in the big city why don t you drive on said miss lantry impatiently we ll be late richard stood up in the cab and looked around he saw a congested flood of wagons trucks cabs vans and street cars filling the vast space where broadway sixth avenue and thirly fourth street cross one another as a twenty six inch maiden fills her twenty two inch girdle and still from all the cross streets they were hurrying and rattling toward the converging point at full speed and hurling thcmselves into the struggling mass locking wheels and adding their drivers imprecations to the clamour the entire traffic of manhattan seemed to have jammed itself around them the oldest new yorker among the thousands of spectators that lined the sidewalks had not witnessed a street blockade of the proportions of this one i m very sorry said richard as he resumed his seat but it looks as if we are stuck they won t get this jumble loosened up in an hour it was my fault if i hadn t dropped the ring we let me see the ring said miss lantry now that it can t be helped i don t care i think theatres are stupid anyway at o clock that night somebody tapped lightly on anthony rockwall s door come in shouted anthony who was in a red dressing gown reading a book of piratical adventures somebody was aunt ellen looking like a grey haired angel that had been left on earth by mistake they re engaged anthony she said softly she has promised to marry our richard on their way to the theatre there was a street blockade and it was two hours before their cab could get out of it and oh brother anthony don t ever boast of the power of money again a little emblem of true love a little ring that symbolised unending and unmercenary affection was the cause of our richard finding his happiness he dropped it in the street and got out to recover it and before they could continue the blockade occurred he spoke to his love and won her there while the cab was hemmed in money is dross compared with true love anthony all right said old anthony i m glad the boy has got what he wanted i told him i wouldn t spare any expense in the matter if but brother anthony what good could your money have done sister said anthony rockwall i ve got my pirate in a devil of a scrape his ship has just been scuttled and he s too good a judge of the value of money to let drown i wish you would let me go on with this chapter the story should end here i wish it would as heartily as you who read it wish it did but we must go to the bottom of the well for truth the next day a person with red hands and a blue polka dot necktie who called himself kelly called at anthony rockwall s house and was at once received in the library well said anthony reaching for his chequebook it was a good bilin of soap let s see you had in cash i paid out oo more of my own said kelly i had to go a little above the estimate i got the express wagons and cabs mostly for but the trucks and two horse teams mostly raised me to the motormen wanted and some of the loaded teams the cops struck me hardest i paid two and the rest and but didn t it work beautiful mr rockwall i m glad william a brady wasn t onto that little outdoor vehicle mob scene i wouldn t want william to break his heart with jealousy and never a rehearsal either the boys was on time to the fraction of a second it was two hours before a snake could get below greeley s statue thirteen hundred there you are kelly said anthony tearing off a check your thousand and the you were out you don t despise money do you kelly me said kelly i can lick the man that invented poverty anthony called kelly when he was at the door you didn t notice said he anywhere in the tie up a kind of a fat boy without any clothes on shooting arrows around with a bow did you why no said kelly mystified i didn t if he was like you say maybe the cops pinched him before i got there i thought the little rascal wouldn t be on hand chuckled anthony good by kelly springtime a la carte it was a day in march never never begin a story this way when you write one no opening could possibly be worse it is unimaginative flat dry and likely to consist of mere wind but in this instance it is allowable for the following paragraph which should have inaugurated the narrative is too wildly extravagant and preposterous to be flaunted in the face of the reader without preparation sarah was crying over her bill of fare think of a new york girl shedding tears on the menu card to account for this you will be allowed to guess that the lobsters were all out or that she had sworn ice cream off during lent or that she had ordered onions or that she had just come from a hackett matinee and then all these theories being wrong you will please let the story proceed the gentleman who announced that the world was an oyster which he with his sword would open made a larger hit than he deserved it is not difficult to open an oyster with a sword but did you ever notice any one try to open the terrestrial bivalve with a typewriter like to wait for a dozen raw opened that way sarah had managed to pry apart the shells with her unhandy weapon far enough to nibble a wee bit at the cold and clammy world within she knew no more shorthand than if she had been a graduate in stenography just let slip upon the world by a business college so not being able to stenog she could not enter that bright galaxy of office talent she was a free lance typewriter and canvassed for odd jobs of copying the most brilliant and crowning feat of sarah s battle with the world was the deal she made with schulenberg s home restaurant the restaurant was next door to the old red brick in which she ball roomed one evening after dining at schulenberg s cent five course table d hote served as fast as you throw the five baseballs at the coloured gentleman s head sarah took away with her the bill of fare it was written in an almost unreadable script neither english nor german and so arranged that if you were not careful you began with a toothpick and rice pudding and ended with soup and the day of the week the next day sarah showed schulenberg a neat card on which the menu was beautifully typewritten with the viands temptingly marshalled under their right and proper heads from hors d oeuvre to not responsible for overcoats and umbrellas schulenberg became a naturalised citizen on the spot before sarah left him she had him willingly committed to an agreement she was to furnish typewritten bills of fare for the twenty one tables in the restaurant a new bill for each day s dinner and new ones for breakfast and lunch as often as changes occurred in the food or as neatness required in return for this schulenberg was to send three meals per diem to sarah s hall room by a waiter an obsequious one if possible and furnish her each afternoon with a pencil draft of what fate had in store for schulenberg s customers on the morrow mutual satisfaction resulted from the agreement schulenberg s patrons now knew what the food they ate was called even if its nature sometimes puzzled them and sarah had food during a cold dull winter which was the main thing with her and then the almanac lied and said that spring had come spring comes when it comes the frozen snows of january still lay like adamant in the crosstown streets the hand organs still played in the good old summertime with their december vivacity and expression men began to make thirty day notes to buy easter dresses janitors shut off steam and when these things happen one may know that the city is still in the clutches of winter one afternoon sarah shivered in her elegant hall bedroom house heated scrupulously clean conveniences seen to be appreciated she had no work to do except schulenberg s menu cards sarah sat in her squeaky willow rocker and looked out the window the calendar on the wall kept crying to her springtime is here sarah springtime is here i tell you look at me sarah my figures show it you ve got a neat figure yourself sarah a nice springtime figure why do you look out the window so sadly sarah s room was at the back of the house looking out the window she could see the windowless rear brick wall of the box factory on the next street but the wall was clearest crystal and sarah was looking down a grassy lane shaded with cherry trees and elms and bordered with raspberry bushes and cherokee roses spring s real harbingers are too subtle for the eye and ear some must have the flowering crocus the wood starring dogwood the voice of bluebird even so gross a reminder as the farewell handshake of the retiring buckwheat and oyster before they can welcome the lady in green to their dull bosoms but to old earth s choicest kin there come straight sweet messages from his newest bride telling them they shall be no stepchildren unless they choose to be on the previous summer sarah had gone into the country and loved a farmer in writing your story never hark back thus it is bad art and cripples interest let it march march sarah stayed two weeks at sunnybrook farm there she learned to love old farmer franklin s son walter farmers have been loved and wedded and turned out to grass in less time but young walter franklin was a modern agriculturist he had a telephone in his cow house and he could figure up exactly what effect next year s canada wheat crop would have on potatoes planted in the dark of the moon it was in this shaded and raspberried lane that walter had wooed and won her and together they had sat and woven a crown of dandelions for her hair he had immoderately praised the effect of the yellow blossoms against her brown tresses and she had left the chaplet there and walked back to the house swinging her straw sailor in her hands they were to marry in the spring at the very first signs of spring walter said and sarah came back to the city to pound her typewriter a knock at the door dispelled sarah s visions of that happy day a waiter had brought the rough pencil draft of the home restaurant s next day fare in old schulenberg s angular hand sarah sat down to her typewriter and slipped a card between the rollers she was a nimble worker generally in an hour and a half the twenty one menu cards were written and ready to day there were more changes on the bill of fare than usual the soups were lighter pork was eliminated from the entrees figuring only with russian turnips among the roasts the gracious spirit of spring pervaded the entire menu lamb that lately capered on the greening hillsides was becoming exploited with the sauce that commemorated its gambols the song of the oyster though not silenced was diminuendo con amore the frying pan seemed to be held inactive behind the beneficent bars of the broiler the pie list swelled the richer puddings had vanished the sausage with his drapery wrapped about him barely lingered in a pleasant thanatopsis with the buckwheats and the sweet but doomed maple sarah s fingers danced like midgets above a summer stream down through the courses she worked giving each item its position according to its length with an accurate eye just above the desserts came the list of vegetables carrots and peas asparagus on toast the perennial tomatoes and corn and succotash lima beans cabbage and then sarah was crying over her bill of fare tears from the depths of some divine despair rose in her heart and gathered to her eyes down went her head on the little typewriter stand and the keyboard rattled a dry accompaniment to her moist sobs for she had received no letter from walter in two weeks and the next item on the bill of fare was dandelions dandelions with some kind of egg but bother the egg dandelions with whose golden blooms walter had crowned her his queen of love and future bride dandelions the harbingers of spring her sorrow s crown of sorrow reminder of her happiest days madam i dare you to smile until you suffer this test let the marechal niel roses that percy brought you on the night you gave him your heart be served as a salad with french dressing before your eyes at a schulenberg table d hote had juliet so seen her love tokens dishonoured the sooner would she have sought the lethean herbs of the good apothecary but what a witch is spring into the great cold city of stone and iron a message had to be sent there was none to convey it but the little hardy courier of the fields with his rough green coat and modest air he is a true soldier of fortune this dent de lion this lion s tooth as the french chefs call him flowered he will assist at love making wreathed in my lady s nut brown hair young and callow and unblossomed he goes into the boiling pot and delivers the word of his sovereign mistress by and by sarah forced back her tears the cards must be written but still in a faint golden glow from her dandeleonine dream she fingered the typewriter keys absently for a little while with her mind and heart in the meadow lane with her young farmer but soon she came swiftly back to the rock bound lanes of manhattan and the typewriter began to rattle and jump like a strike breaker s motor car at o clock the waiter brought her dinner and carried away the typewritten bill of fare when sarah ate she set aside with a sigh the dish of dandelions with its crowning ovarious accompaniment as this dark mass had been transformed from a bright and love indorsed flower to be an ignominious vegetable so had her summer hopes wilted and perished love may as shakespeare said feed on itself but sarah could not bring herself to eat the dandelions that had graced as ornaments the first spiritual banquet of her heart s true affection at the couple in the next room began to quarrel the man in the room above sought for a on his flute the gas went a little lower three coal wagons started to unload the only sound of which the phonograph is jealous cats on the back fences slowly retreated toward mukden by these signs sarah knew that it was time for her to read she got out the cloister and the hearth the best non selling book of the month settled her feet on her trunk and began to wander with gerard the front door bell rang the landlady answered it sarah left gerard and denys treed by a bear and listened oh yes you would just as she did and then a strong voice was heard in the hall below and sarah jumped for her door leaving the book on the floor and the first round easily the bear s you have guessed it she reached the top of the stairs just as her farmer came up three at a jump and reaped and garnered her with nothing left for the gleaners why haven t you written oh why cried sarah new york is a pretty large town said walter franklin i came in a week ago to your old address i found that you went away on a thursday that consoled some it eliminated the possible friday bad luck but it didn t prevent my hunting for you with police and otherwise ever since i wrote said sarah vehemently never got it then how did you find me the young farmer smiled a springtime smile i dropped into that home restaurant next door this evening said he i don t care who knows it i like a dish of some kind of greens at this time of the year i ran my eye down that nice typewritten bill of fare looking for something in that line when i got below cabbage i turned my chair over and hollered for the proprietor he told me where you lived i remember sighed sarah happily that was dandelions below cabbage i d know that cranky capital w way above the line that your typewriter makes anywhere in the world said franklin why there s no w in dandelions said sarah in surprise the young man drew the bill of fare from his pocket and pointed to a line sarah recognised the first card she had typewritten that afternoon there was still the rayed splotch in the upper right hand corner where a tear had fallen but over the spot where one should have read the name of the meadow plant the clinging memory of their golden blossoms had allowed her fingers to strike strange keys between the red cabbage and the stuffed green peppers was the item dearest walter with hard boiled egg the green door suppose you should be walking down broadway after dinner with ten minutes allotted to the consummation of your cigar while you are choosing between a diverting tragedy and something serious in the way of vaudeville suddenly a hand is laid upon your arm you turn to look into the thrilling eyes of a beautiful woman wonderful in diamonds and russian sables she thrusts hurriedly into your hand an extremely hot buttered roll flashes out a tiny pair of scissors snips off the second button of your overcoat meaningly ejaculates the one word parallelogram and swiftly flies down a cross street looking back fearfully over her shoulder that would be pure adventure would you accept it not you you would flush with embarrassment you would sheepishly drop the roll and continue down broadway fumbling feebly for the missing button this you would do unless you are one of the blessed few in whom the pure spirit of adventure is not dead true adventurers have never been plentiful they who are set down in print as such have been mostly business men with newly invented methods they have been out after the things they wanted golden fleeces holy grails lady loves treasure crowns and fame the true adventurer goes forth aimless and uncalculating to meet and greet unknown fate a fine example was the prodigal son when he started back home half adventurers brave and splendid figures have been numerous from the crusades to the palisades they have enriched the arts of history and fiction and the trade of historical fiction but each of them had a prize to win a goal to kick an axe to grind a race to run a new thrust in tierce to deliver a name to carve a crow to pick so they were not followers of true adventure in the big city the twin spirits romance and adventure are always abroad seeking worthy wooers as we roam the streets they slyly peep at us and challenge us in twenty different guises without knowing why we look up suddenly to see in a window a face that seems to belong to our gallery of intimate portraits in a sleeping thoroughfare we hear a cry of agony and fear coming from an empty and shuttered house instead of at our familiar curb a cab driver deposits us before a strange door which one with a smile opens for us and bids us enter a slip of paper written upon flutters down to our feet from the high lattices of chance we exchange glances of instantaneous hate affection and fear with hurrying strangers in the passing crowds a sudden douse of rain and our umbrella may be sheltering the daughter of the full moon and first cousin of the sidereal system at every corner handkerchiefs drop fingers beckon eyes besiege and the lost the lonely the rapturous the mysterious the perilous changing clues of adventure are slipped into our fingers but few of us are willing to hold and follow them we are grown stiff with the ramrod of convention down our backs we pass on and some day we come at the end of a very dull life to reflect that our romance has been a pallid thing of a marriage or two a satin rosette kept in a safe deposit drawer and a lifelong feud with a steam radiator rudolf steiner was a true adventurer few were the evenings on which he did not go forth from his hall bedchamber in search of the unexpected and the egregious the most interesting thing in life seemed to him to be what might lie just around the next corner sometimes his willingness to tempt fate led him into strange paths twice he had spent the night in a station house again and again he had found himself the dupe of ingenious and mercenary tricksters his watch and money had been the price of one flattering allurement but with undiminished ardour he picked up every glove cast before him into the merry lists of adventure one evening rudolf was strolling along a crosstown street in the older central part of the city two streams of people filled the sidewalks the home hurrying and that restless contingent that abandons home for the specious welcome of the thousand candle power table d hote the young adventurer was of pleasing presence and moved serenely and watchfully by daylight he was a salesman in a piano store he wore his tie drawn through a topaz ring instead of fastened with a stick pin and once he had written to the editor of a magazine that junie s love test by miss libbey had been the book that had most influenced his life during his walk a violent chattering of teeth in a glass case on the sidewalk seemed at first to draw his attention with a qualm to a restaurant before which it was set but a second glance revealed the electric letters of a dentist s sign high above the next door a giant negro fantastically dressed in a red embroidered coat yellow trousers and a military cap discreetly distributed cards to those of the passing crowd who consented to take them this mode of dentistic advertising was a common sight to rudolf usually he passed the dispenser of the dentist s cards without reducing his store but tonight the african slipped one into his hand so deftly that he retained it there smiling a little at the successful feat when he had travelled a few yards further he glanced at the card indifferently surprised he turned it over and looked again with interest one side of the card was blank on the other was written in ink three words the green door and then rudolf saw three steps in front of him a man throw down the card the negro had given him as he passed rudolf picked it up it was printed with the dentist s name and address and the usual schedule of plate work and bridge work and specious promises of painless operations the adventurous piano salesman halted at the corner and considered then he crossed the street walked down a block recrossed and joined the upward current of people again without seeming to notice the negro as he passed the second time he carelessly took the card that was handed him ten steps away he inspected it in the same handwriting that appeared on the first card the green door was inscribed upon it three or four cards were tossed to the pavement by pedestrians both following and leading him these fell blank side up rudolf turned them over every one bore the printed legend of the dental parlours rarely did the arch sprite adventure need to beckon twice to rudolf steiner his true follower but twice it had been done and the quest was on rudolf walked slowly back to where the giant negro stood by the case of rattling teeth this time as he passed he received no card in spite of his gaudy and ridiculous garb the ethiopian displayed a natural barbaric dignity as he stood offering the cards suavely to some allowing others to pass unmolested every half minute he chanted a harsh unintelligible phrase akin to the jabber of car conductors and grand opera and not only did he withhold a card this time but it seemed to rudolf that he received from the shining and massive black countenance a look of cold almost contemptuous disdain the look stung the adventurer he read in it a silent accusation that he had been found wanting whatever the mysterious written words on the cards might mean the black had selected him twice from the throng for their recipient and now seemed to have condemned him as deficient in the wit and spirit to engage the enigma standing aside from the rush the young man made a rapid estimate of the building in which he conceived that his adventure must lie five stories high it rose a small restaurant occupied the basement the first floor now closed seemed to house millinery or furs the second floor by the winking electric letters was the dentist s above this a polyglot babel of signs struggled to indicate the abodes of palmists dressmakers musicians and doctors still higher up draped curtains and milk bottles white on the window sills proclaimed the regions of domesticity after concluding his survey rudolf walked briskly up the high flight of stone steps into the house up two flights of the carpeted stairway he continued and at its top paused the hallway there was dimly lighted by two pale jets of gas one far to his right the other nearer to his left he looked toward the nearer light and saw within its wan halo a green door for one moment he hesitated then he seemed to see the contumelious sneer of the african juggler of cards and then he walked straight to the green door and knocked against it moments like those that passed before his knock was answered measure the quick breath of true adventure what might not be behind those green panels gamesters at play cunning rogues baiting their traps with subtle skill beauty in love with courage and thus planning to be sought by it danger death love disappointment ridicule any of these might respond to that temerarious rap a faint rustle was heard inside and the door slowly opened a girl not yet twenty stood there white faced and tottering she loosed the knob and swayed weakly groping with one hand rudolf caught her and laid her on a faded couch that stood against the wall he closed the door and took a swift glance around the room by the light of a flickering gas jet neat but extreme poverty was the story that he read the girl lay still as if in a faint rudolf looked around the room excitedly for a barrel people must be rolled upon a barrel who no no that was for drowned persons he began to fan her with his hat that was successful for he struck her nose with the brim of his derby and she opened her eyes and then the young man saw that hers indeed was the one missing face from his heart s gallery of intimate portraits the frank grey eyes the little nose turning pertly outward the chestnut hair curling like the tendrils of a pea vine seemed the right end and reward of all his wonderful adventures but the face was wofully thin and pale the girl looked at him calmly and then smiled fainted didn t i she asked weakly well who wouldn t you try going without anything to eat for three days and see himmel exclaimed rudolf jumping up wait till i come back he dashed out the green door and down the stairs in twenty minutes he was back again kicking at the door with his toe for her to open it with both arms he hugged an array of wares from the grocery and the restaurant on the table he laid them bread and butter cold meats cakes pies pickles oysters a roasted chicken a bottle of milk and one of redhot tea this is ridiculous said rudolf blusteringly to go without eating you must quit making election bets of this kind supper is ready he helped her to a chair at the table and asked is there a cup for the tea on the shelf by the window she answered when he turned again with the cup he saw her with eyes shining rapturously beginning upon a huge dill pickle that she had rooted out from the paper bags with a woman s unerring instinct he took it from her laughingly and poured the cup full of milk drink that first he ordered and then you shall have some tea and then a chicken wing if you are very good you shall have a pickle to morrow and now if you ll allow me to be your guest we ll have supper he drew up the other chair the tea brightened the girl s eyes and brought back some of her colour she began to eat with a sort of dainty ferocity like some starved wild animal she seemcd to regard the young man s presence and the aid he had rendered her as a natural thing not as though she undervalued the conventions but as one whose great stress gave her the right to put aside the artificial for the human but gradually with the return of strength and comfort came also a sense of the little conventions that belong and she began to tell him her little story it was one of a thousand such as the city yawns at every day the shop girl s story of insufficient wages further reduced by fines that go to swell the store s profits of time lost through illness and then of lost positions lost hope and the knock of the adventurer upon the green door but to rudolf the history sounded as big as the iliad or the crisis in junie s love test to think of you going through all that he exclaimed it was something fierce said the girl solemnly and you have no relatives or friends in the city none whatever i am all alone in the world too said rudolf after a pause i am glad of that said the girl promptly and somehow it pleased the young man to hear that she approved of his bereft condition very suddenly her eyelids dropped and she sighed deeply i m awfully sleepy she said and i feel so good then rudolf rose and took his hat i ll say good night a long night s sleep will be fine for you he held out his hand and she took it and said good night but her eyes asked a question so eloquently so frankly and pathetically that he answered it with words oh i m coming back to morrow to see how you are getting along you can t get rid of me so easily then at the door as though the way of his coming had been so much less important than the fact that he had come she asked how did you come to knock at my door he looked at her for a moment remembering the cards and felt a sudden jealous pain what if they had fallen into other hands as adventurous as his quickly he decided that she must never know the truth he would never let her know that he was aware of the strange expedient to which she had been driven by her great distress one of our piano tuners lives in this house he said i knocked at your door by mistake the last thing he saw in the room before the green door closed was her smile at the head of the stairway he paused and looked curiously about him and then he went along the hallway to its other end and coming back ascended to the floor above and continued his puzzled explorations every door that he found in the house was painted green wondering he descended to the sidewalk the fantastic african was still there rudolf confronted him with his two cards in his hand will you tell me why you gave me these cards and what they mean he asked in a broad good natured grin the negro exhibited a splendid advertisement of his master s profession dar it is boss he said pointing down the street but i spect you is a little late for de fust act looking the way he pointed rudolf saw above the entrance to a theatre the blazing electric sign of its new play the green door i m informed dat it s a fust rate show sah said the negro de agent what represents it pussented me with a dollar sah to distribute a few of his cards along with de doctah s may i offer you one of de doctah s cards sah at the corner of the block in which he lived rudolf stopped for a glass of beer and a cigar when he had come out with his lighted weed he buttoned his coat pushed back his hat and said stoutly to the lamp post on the corner all the same i believe it was the hand of fate that doped out the way for me to find her which conclusion under the circumstances certainly admits rudolf steiner to the ranks of the true followers of romance and adventure from the cabby s seat the cabby has his point of view it is more single minded perhaps than that of a follower of any other calling from the high swaying seat of his hansom he looks upon his fellow men as nomadic particles of no account except when possessed of migratory desires he is jehu and you are goods in transit be you president or vagabond to cabby you are only a fare he takes you up cracks his whip joggles your vertebrae and sets you down when time for payment arrives if you exhibit a familiarity with legal rates you come to know what contempt is if you find that you have left your pocketbook behind you are made to realise the mildness of dante s imagination it is not an extravagant theory that the cabby s singleness of purpose and concentrated view of life are the results of the hansom s peculiar construction the cock of the roost sits aloft like jupiter on an unsharable seat holding your fate between two thongs of inconstant leather helpless ridiculous confined bobbing like a toy mandarin you sit like a rat in a trap you before whom butlers cringe on solid land and must squeak upward through a slit in your peripatetic sarcophagus to make your feeble wishes known then in a cab you are not even an occupant you are contents you are a cargo at sea and the cherub that sits up aloft has davy jones s street and number by heart one night there were sounds of revelry in the big brick tenement house next door but one to mcgary s family cafe the sounds seemed to emanate from the apartments of the walsh family the sidewalk was obstructed by an assortment of interested neighbours who opened a lane from time to time for a hurrying messenger bearing from mcgary s goods pertinent to festivity and diversion the sidewalk contingent was engaged in comment and discussion from which it made no effort to eliminate the news that norah walsh was being married in the fulness of time there was an eruption of the merry makers to the sidewalk the uninvited guests enveloped and permeated them and upon the night air rose joyous cries congratulations laughter and unclassified noises born of mcgary s oblations to the hymeneal scene close to the curb stood jerry o donovan s cab night hawk was jerry called but no more lustrous or cleaner hansom than his ever closed its doors upon point lace and november violets and jerry s horse i am within bounds when i tell you that he was stuffed with oats until one of those old ladies who leave their dishes unwashed at home and go about having expressmen arrested would have smiled yes smiled to have seen him among the shifting sonorous pulsing crowd glimpses could be had of jerry s high hat battered by the winds and rains of many years of his nose like a carrot battered by the frolicsome athletic progeny of millionaires and by contumacious fares of his brass buttoned green coat admired in the vicinity of mcgary s it was plain that jerry had usurped the functions of his cab and was carrying a load indeed the figure may be extended and he be likened to a bread waggon if we admit the testimony of a youthful spectator who was heard to remark jerry has got a bun from somewhere among the throng in the street or else out of the thin stream of pedestrians a young woman tripped and stood by the cab the professional hawk s eye of jerry caught the movement he made a lurch for the cab overturning three or four onlookers and himself no he caught the cap of a water plug and kept his feet like a sailor shinning up the ratlins during a squall jerry mounted to his professional seat once he was there mcgary s liquids were baffled he seesawed on the mizzenmast of his craft as safe as a steeple jack rigged to the flagpole of a skyscraper step in lady said jerry gathering his lines the young woman stepped into the cab the doors shut with a bang jerry s whip cracked in the air the crowd in the gutter scattered and the fine hansom dashed away crosstown when the oat spry horse had hedged a little his first spurt of speed jerry broke the lid of his cab and called down through the aperture in the voice of a cracked megaphone trying to please where now will ye be drivin to anywhere you please came up the answer musical and contented tis drivin for pleasure she is thought jerry and then he suggested as a matter of course take a thrip around in the park lady twill be ilegant cool and fine just as you like answered the fare pleasantly the cab headed for fifth avenue and sped up that perfect street jerry bounced and swayed in his seat the potent fluids of mcgary were disquieted and they sent new fumes to his head he sang an ancient song of killisnook and brandished his whip like a baton inside the cab the fare sat up straight on the cushions looking to right and left at the lights and houses even in the shadowed hansom her eyes shone like stars at twilight when they reached fifty ninth street jerry s head was bobbing and his reins were slack but his horse turned in through the park gate and began the old familiar nocturnal round and then the fare leaned back entranced and breathed deep the clean wholesome odours of grass and leaf and bloom and the wise beast in the shafts knowing his ground struck into his by the hour gait and kept to the right of the road habit also struggled successfully against jerry s increasing torpor he raised the hatch of his storm tossed vessel and made the inquiry that cabbies do make in the park like shtop at the cas sino lady gezzer r freshm s n lish n the music ev body shtops i think that would be nice said the fare they reined up with a plunge at the casino entrance the cab doors flew open the fare stepped directly upon the floor at once she was caught in a web of ravishing music and dazzled by a panorama of lights and colours some one slipped a little square card into her hand on which was printed a number she looked around and saw her cab twenty yards away already lining up in its place among the waiting mass of carriages cabs and motor cars and then a man who seemed to be all shirt front danced backward before her and next she was seated at a little table by a railing over which climbed a jessamine vine there seemed to be a wordless invitation to purchase she consulted a collection of small coins in a thin purse and received from them license to order a glass of beer there she sat inhaling and absorbing it all the new coloured new shaped life in a fairy palace in an enchanted wood at fifty tables sat princes and queens clad in all the silks and gems of the world and now and then one of them would look curiously at jerry s fare they saw a plain figure dressed in a pink silk of the kind that is tempered by the word foulard and a plain face that wore a look of love of life that the queens envied twice the long hands of the clocks went round royalties thinned from their al fresco thrones and buzzed or clattered away in their vehicles of state the music retired into cases of wood and bags of leather and baize waiters removed cloths pointedly near the plain figure sitting almost alone jerry s fare rose and held out her numbered card simply is there anything coming on the ticket she asked a waiter told her it was her cab check and that she should give it to the man at the entrance this man took it and called the number only three hansoms stood in line the driver of one of them went and routed out jerry asleep in his cab he swore deeply climbed to the captain s bridge and steered his craft to the pier his fare entered and the cab whirled into the cool fastnesses of the park along the shortest homeward cuts at the gate a glimmer of reason in the form of sudden suspicion seized upon jerry s beclouded mind one or two things occurred to him he stopped his horse raised the trap and dropped his phonographic voice like a lead plummet through the aperture i want to see four dollars before goin any further on th thrip have ye got th dough four dollars laughed the fare softly dear me no i ve only got a few pennies and a dime or two jerry shut down the trap and slashed his oat fed horse the clatter of hoofs strangled but could not drown the sound of his profanity he shouted choking and gurgling curses at the starry heavens he cut viciously with his whip at passing vehicles he scattered fierce and ever changing oaths and imprecations along the streets so that a late truck driver crawling homeward heard and was abashed but he knew his recourse and made for it at a gallop at the house with the green lights beside the steps he pulled up he flung wide the cab doors and tumbled heavily to the ground come on you he said roughly his fare came forth with the casino dreamy smile still on her plain face jerry took her by the arm and led her into the police station a gray moustached sergeant looked keenly across the desk he and the cabby were no strangers sargeant began jerry in his old raucous martyred thunderous tones of complaint i ve got a fare here that jerry paused he drew a knotted red hand across his brow the fog set up by mcgary was beginning to clear away a fare sargeant he continued with a grin that i want to inthroduce to ye it s me wife that i married at ould man walsh s this avening and a divil of a time we had tis thrue shake hands wid th sargeant norah and we ll be off to home before stepping into the cab norah sighed profoundly i ve had such a nice time jerry said she an unfinished story we no longer groan and heap ashes upon our heads when the flames of tophet are mentioned for even the preachers have begun to tell us that god is radium or ether or some scientific compound and that the worst we wicked ones may expect is a chemical reaction this is a pleasing hypothesis but there lingers yet some of the old goodly terror of orthodoxy there are but two subjects upon which one may discourse with a free imagination and without the possibility of being controverted you may talk of your dreams and you may tell what you heard a parrot say both morpheus and the bird are incompetent witnesses and your listener dare not attack your recital the baseless fabric of a vision then shall furnish my theme chosen with apologies and regrets instead of the more limited field of pretty polly s small talk i had a dream that was so far removed from the higher criticism that it had to do with the ancient respectable and lamented bar of judgment theory gabriel had played his trump and those of us who could not follow suit were arraigned for examination i noticed at one side a gathering of professional bondsmen in solemn black and collars that buttoned behind but it seemed there was some trouble about their real estate titles and they did not appear to be getting any of us out a fly cop an angel policeman flew over to me and took me by the left wing near at hand was a group of very prosperous looking spirits arraigned for judgment do you belong with that bunch the policeman asked who are they was my answer why said he they are but this irrelevant stuff is taking up space that the story should occupy dulcie worked in a department store she sold hamburg edging or stuffed peppers or automobiles or other little trinkets such as they keep in department stores of what she earned dulcie received six dollars per week the remainder was credited to her and debited to somebody else s account in the ledger kept by g oh primal energy you say reverend doctor well then in the ledger of primal energy during her first year in the store dulcie was paid five dollars per week it would be instructive to know how she lived on that amount don t care very well probably you are interested in larger amounts six dollars is a larger amount i will tell you how she lived on six dollars per week one afternoon at six when dulcie was sticking her hat pin within an eighth of an inch of her medulla oblongata she said to her chum sadie the girl that waits on you with her left side say sade i made a date for dinner this evening with piggy you never did exclaimed sadie admiringly well ain t you the lucky one piggy s an awful swell and he always takes a girl to swell places he took blanche up to the hoffman house one evening where they have swell music and you see a lot of swells you ll have a swell time dulce dulcie hurried homeward her eyes were shining and her cheeks showed the delicate pink of life s real life s approaching dawn it was friday and she had fifty cents left of her last week s wages the streets were filled with the rush hour floods of people the electric lights of broadway were glowing calling moths from miles from leagues from hundreds of leagues out of darkness around to come in and attend the singeing school men in accurate clothes with faces like those carved on cherry stones by the old salts in sailors homes turned and stared at dulcie as she sped unheeding past them manhattan the night blooming cereus was beginning to unfold its dead white heavy odoured petals dulcie stopped in a store where goods were cheap and bought an imitation lace collar with her fifty cents that money was to have been spent otherwise fifteen cents for supper ten cents for breakfast ten cents for lunch another dime was to be added to her small store of savings and five cents was to be squandered for licorice drops the kind that made your cheek look like the toothache and last as long the licorice was an extravagance almost a carouse but what is life without pleasures dulcie lived in a furnished room there is this difference between a furnished room and a boardinghouse in a furnished room other people do not know it when you go hungry dulcie went up to her room the third floor back in a west side brownstone front she lit the gas scientists tell us that the diamond is the hardest substance known their mistake landladies know of a compound beside which the diamond is as putty they pack it in the tips of gas burners and one may stand on a chair and dig at it in vain until one s fingers are pink and bruised a hairpin will not remove it therefore let us call it immovable so dulcie lit the gas in its one fourth candlepower glow we will observe the room couch bed dresser table washstand chair of this much the landlady was guilty the rest was dulcie s on the dresser were her treasures a gilt china vase presented to her by sadie a calendar issued by a pickle works a book on the divination of dreams some rice powder in a glass dish and a cluster of artificial cherries tied with a pink ribbon against the wrinkly mirror stood pictures of general kitchener william muldoon the duchess of marlborough and benvenuto cellini against one wall was a plaster of paris plaque of an o callahan in a roman helmet near it was a violent oleograph of a lemon coloured child assaulting an inflammatory butterfly this was dulcie s final judgment in art but it had never been upset her rest had never been disturbed by whispers of stolen copes no critic had elevated his eyebrows at her infantile entomologist piggy was to call for her at seven while she swiftly makes ready let us discreetly face the other way and gossip for the room dulcie paid two dollars per week on week days her breakfast cost ten cents she made coffee and cooked an egg over the gaslight while she was dressing on sunday mornings she feasted royally on veal chops and pineapple fritters at billy s restaurant at a cost of twenty five cents and tipped the waitress ten cents new york presents so many temptations for one to run into extravagance she had her lunches in the department store restaurant at a cost of sixty cents for the week dinners were the evening papers show me a new yorker going without his daily paper came to six cents and two sunday papers one for the personal column and the other to read were ten cents the total amounts to now one has to buy clothes and i give it up i hear of wonderful bargains in fabrics and of miracles performed with needle and thread but i am in doubt i hold my pen poised in vain when i would add to dulcie s life some of those joys that belong to woman by virtue of all the unwritten sacred natural inactive ordinances of the equity of heaven twice she had been to coney island and had ridden the hobby horses tis a weary thing to count your pleasures by summers instead of by hours piggy needs but a word when the girls named him an undeserving stigma was cast upon the noble family of swine the words of three letters lesson in the old blue spelling book begins with piggy s biography he was fat he had the soul of a rat the habits of a bat and the magnanimity of a cat he wore expensive clothes and was a connoisseur in starvation he could look at a shop girl and tell you to an hour how long it had been since she had eaten anything more nourishing than marshmallows and tea he hung about the shopping districts and prowled around in department stores with his invitations to dinner men who escort dogs upon the streets at the end of a string look down upon him he is a type i can dwell upon him no longer my pen is not the kind intended for him i am no carpenter at ten minutes to seven dulcie was ready she looked at herself in the wrinkly mirror the reflection was satisfactory the dark blue dress fitting without a wrinkle the hat with its jaunty black feather the but slightly soiled gloves all representing self denial even of food itself were vastly becoming dulcie forgot everything else for a moment except that she was beautiful and that life was about to lift a corner of its mysterious veil for her to observe its wonders no gentleman had ever asked her out before now she was going for a brief moment into the glitter and exalted show the girls said that piggy was a spender there would be a grand dinner and music and splendidly dressed ladies to look at and things to eat that strangely twisted the girls jaws when they tried to tell about them no doubt she would be asked out again there was a blue pongee suit in a window that she knew by saving twenty cents a week instead of ten in let s see oh it would run into years but there was a second hand store in seventh avenue where somebody knocked at the door dulcie opened it the landlady stood there with a spurious smile sniffing for cooking by stolen gas a gentleman s downstairs to see you she said name is mr wiggins by such epithet was piggy known to unfortunate ones who had to take him seriously dulcie turned to the dresser to get her handkerchief and then she stopped still and bit her underlip hard while looking in her mirror she had seen fairyland and herself a princess just awakening from a long slumber she had forgotten one that was watching her with sad beautiful stern eyes the only one there was to approve or condemn what she did straight and slender and tall with a look of sorrowful reproach on his handsome melancholy face general kitchener fixed his wonderful eyes on her out of his gilt photograph frame on the dresser dulcie turned like an automatic doll to the landlady tell him i can t go she said dully tell him i m sick or something tell him i m not going out after the door was closed and locked dulcie fell upon her bed crushing her black tip and cried for ten minutes general kitchener was her only friend he was dulcie s ideal of a gallant knight he looked as if he might have a secret sorrow and his wonderful moustache was a dream and she was a little afraid of that stern yet tender look in his eyes she used to have little fancies that he would call at the house sometime and ask for her with his sword clanking against his high boots once when a boy was rattling a piece of chain against a lamp post she had opened the window and looked out but there was no use she knew that general kitchener was away over in japan leading his army against the savage turks and he would never step out of his gilt frame for her yet one look from him had vanquished piggy that night yes for that night when her cry was over dulcie got up and took off her best dress and put on her old blue kimono she wanted no dinner she sang two verses of sammy then she became intensely interested in a little red speck on the side of her nose and after that was attended to she drew up a chair to the rickety table and told her fortune with an old deck of cards the horrid impudent thing she said aloud and i never gave him a word or a look to make him think it at nine o clock dulcie took a tin box of crackers and a little pot of raspberry jam out of her trunk and had a feast she offered general kitchener some jam on a cracker but he only looked at her as the sphinx would have looked at a butterfly if there are butterflies in the desert don t eat it if you don t want to said dulcie and don t put on so many airs and scold so with your eyes i wonder if you d he so superior and snippy if you had to live on six dollars a week it was not a good sign for dulcie to be rude to general kitchener and then she turned benvenuto cellini face downward with a severe gesture but that was not inexcusable for she had always thought he was henry viii and she did not approve of him at half past nine dulcie took a last look at the pictures on the dresser turned out the light and skipped into bed it s an awful thing to go to bed with a good night look at general kitchener william muldoon the duchess of marlborough and benvenuto cellini this story really doesn t get anywhere at all the rest of it comes later sometime when piggy asks dulcie again to dine with him and she is feeling lonelier than usual and general kitchener happens to be looking the other way and then as i said before i dreamed that i was standing near a crowd of prosperous looking angels and a policeman took me by the wing and asked if i belonged with them who are they i asked why said he they are the men who hired working girls and paid em five or six dollars a week to live on are you one of the bunch not on your immortality said i i m only the fellow that set fire to an orphan asylum and murdered a blind man for his pennies the caliph cupid and the clock prince michael of the electorate of valleluna sat on his favourite bench in the park the coolness of the september night quickened the life in him like a rare tonic wine the benches were not filled for park loungers with their stagnant blood are prompt to detect and fly home from the crispness of early autumn the moon was just clearing the roofs of the range of dwellings that bounded the quadrangle on the east children laughed and played about the fine sprayed fountain in the shadowed spots fauns and hamadryads wooed unconscious of the gaze of mortal eyes a hand organ philomel by the grace of our stage carpenter fancy fluted and droned in a side street around the enchanted boundaries of the little park street cars spat and mewed and the stilted trains roared like tigers and lions prowling for a place to enter and above the trees shone the great round shining face of an illuminated clock in the tower of an antique public building prince michael s shoes were wrecked far beyond the skill of the carefullest cobbler the ragman would have declined any negotiations concerning his clothes the two weeks stubble on his face was grey and brown and red and greenish yellow as if it had been made up from individual contributions from the chorus of a musical comedy no man existed who had money enough to wear so bad a hat as his prince michael sat on his favourite bench and smiled it was a diverting thought to him that he was wealthy enough to buy every one of those close ranged bulky window lit mansions that faced him if he chose he could have matched gold equipages jewels art treasures estates and acres with any croesus in this proud city of manhattan and scarcely have entered upon the bulk of his holdings he could have sat at table with reigning sovereigns the social world the world of art the fellowship of the elect adulation imitation the homage of the fairest honours from the highest praise from the wisest flattery esteem credit pleasure fame all the honey of life was waiting in the comb in the hive of the world for prince michael of the electorate of valleluna whenever he might choose to take it but his choice was to sit in rags and dinginess on a bench in a park for he had tasted of the fruit of the tree of life and finding it bitter in his mouth had stepped out of eden for a time to seek distraction close to the unarmoured beating heart of the world these thoughts strayed dreamily through the mind of prince michael as he smiled under the stubble of his polychromatic beard lounging thus clad as the poorest of mendicants in the parks he loved to study humanity he found in altruism more pleasure than his riches his station and all the grosser sweets of life had given him it was his chief solace and satisfaction to alleviate individual distress to confer favours upon worthy ones who had need of succour to dazzle unfortunates by unexpected and bewildering gifts of truly royal magnificence bestowed however with wisdom and judiciousness and as prince michael s eye rested upon the glowing face of the great clock in the tower his smile altruistic as it was became slightly tinged with contempt big thoughts were the prince s and it was always with a shake of his head that he considered the subjugation of the world to the arbitrary measures of time the comings and goings of people in hurry and dread controlled by the little metal moving hands of a clock always made him sad by and by came a young man in evening clothes and sat upon the third bench from the prince for half an hour he smoked cigars with nervous haste and then he fell to watching the face of the illuminated clock above the trees his perturbation was evident and the prince noted in sorrow that its cause was connected in some manner with the slowly moving hands of the timepiece his highness arose and went to the young man s bench i beg your pardon for addressing you he said but i perceive that you are disturbed in mind if it may serve to mitigate the liberty i have taken i will add that i am prince michael heir to the throne of the electorate of valleluna i appear incognito of course as you may gather from my appearance it is a fancy of mine to render aid to others whom i think worthy of it perhaps the matter that seems to distress you is one that would more readily yield to our mutual efforts the young man looked up brightly at the prince brightly but the perpendicular line of perplexity between his brows was not smoothed away he laughed and even then it did not but he accepted the momentary diversion glad to meet you prince he said good humouredly yes i d say you were incog all right thanks for your offer of assistance but i don t see where your butting in would help things any it s a kind of private affair you know but thanks all the same prince michael sat at the young man s side he was often rebuffed but never offensively his courteous manner and words forbade that clocks said the prince are shackles on the feet of mankind i have observed you looking persistently at that clock its face is that of a tyrant its numbers are false as those on a lottery ticket its hands are those of a bunco steerer who makes an appointment with you to your ruin let me entreat you to throw off its humiliating bonds and to cease to order your affairs by that insensate monitor of brass and steel i don t usually said the young man i carry a watch except when i ve got my radiant rags on i know human nature as i do the trees and grass said the prince with earnest dignity i am a master of philosophy a graduate in art and i hold the purse of a fortunatus there are few mortal misfortunes that i cannot alleviate or overcome i have read your countenance and found in it honesty and nobility as well as distress i beg of you to accept my advice or aid do not belie the intelligence i see in your face by judging from my appearance of my ability to defeat your troubles the young man glanced at the clock again and frowned darkly when his gaze strayed from the glowing horologue of time it rested intently upon a four story red brick house in the row of dwellings opposite to where he sat the shades were drawn and the lights in many rooms shone dimly through them ten minutes to nine exclaimed the young man with an impatient gesture of despair he turned his back upon the house and took a rapid step or two in a contrary direction remain commanded prince michael in so potent a voice that the disturbed one wheeled around with a somewhat chagrined laugh i ll give her the ten minutes and then i m off he muttered and then aloud to the prince i ll join you in confounding all clocks my friend and throw in women too sit down said the prince calmly i do not accept your addition women are the natural enemies of clocks and therefore the allies of those who would seek liberation from these monsters that measure our follies and limit our pleasures if you will so far confide in me i would ask you to relate to me your story the young man threw himself upon the bench with a reckless laugh your royal highness i will he said in tones of mock deference do you see yonder house the one with three upper windows lighted well at o clock i stood in that house with the young lady i am that is i was engaged to i had been doing wrong my dear prince i had been a naughty boy and she had heard of it i wanted to be forgiven of course we are always wanting women to forgive us aren t we prince i want time to think it over said she there is one thing certain i will either fully forgive you or i will never see your face again there will be no half way business at half past eight she said at exactly half past eight you may be watching the middle upper window of the top floor if i decide to forgive i will hang out of that window a white silk scarf you will know by that that all is as was before and you may come to me if you see no scarf you may consider that everything between us is ended forever that concluded the young man bitterly is why i have been watching that clock the time for the signal to appear has passed twenty three minutes ago do you wonder that i am a little disturbed my prince of rags and whiskers let me repeat to you said prince michael in his even well modulated tones that women are the natural enemies of clocks clocks are an evil women a blessing the signal may yet appear never on your principality exclaimed the young man hopelessly you don t know marian of course she s always on time to the minute that was the first thing about her that attracted me i ve got the mitten instead of the scarf i ought to have known at that my goose was cooked i ll go west on the to night with jack milburn the jig s up i ll try jack s ranch awhile and top off with the klondike and whiskey good night er er prince prince michael smiled his enigmatic gentle comprehending smile and caught the coat sleeve of the other the brilliant light in the prince s eyes was softening to a dreamier cloudy translucence wait he said solemnly till the clock strikes i have wealth and power and knowledge above most men but when the clock strikes i am afraid stay by me until then this woman shall be yours you have the word of the hereditary prince of valleluna on the day of your marriage i will give you and a palace on the hudson but there must be no clocks in that palace they measure our follies and limit our pleasures do you agree to that of course said the young man cheerfully they re a nuisance anyway always ticking and striking and getting you late for dinner he glanced again at the clock in the tower the hands stood at three minutes to nine i think said prince michael that i will sleep a little the day has been fatiguing he stretched himself upon a bench with the manner of one who had slept thus before you will find me in this park on any evening when the weather is suitable said the prince sleepily come to me when your marriage day is set and i will give you a cheque for the money thanks your highness said the young man seriously it doesn t look as if i would need that palace on the hudson but i appreciate your offer just the same prince michael sank into deep slumber his battered hat rolled from the bench to the ground the young man lifted it placed it over the frowsy face and moved one of the grotesquely relaxed limbs into a more comfortable position poor devil he said as he drew the tattered clothes closer about the prince s breast sonorous and startling came the stroke of from the clock tower the young man sighed again turned his face for one last look at the house of his relinquished hopes and cried aloud profane words of holy rapture from the middle upper window blossomed in the dusk a waving snowy fluttering wonderful divine emblem of forgiveness and promised joy by came a citizen rotund comfortable home hurrying unknowing of the delights of waving silken scarfs on the borders of dimly lit parks will you oblige me with the time sir asked the young man and the citizen shrewdly conjecturing his watch to be safe dragged it out and announced twenty nine and a half minutes past eight sir and then from habit he glanced at the clock in the tower and made further oration by george that clock s half an hour fast first time in ten years i ve known it to be off this watch of mine never varies a but the citizen was talking to vacancy he turned and saw his hearer a fast receding black shadow flying in the direction of a house with three lighted upper windows and in the morning came along two policemen on their way to the beats they owned the park was deserted save for one dilapidated figure that sprawled asleep on a bench they stopped and gazed upon it it s dopy mike said one he hits the pipe every night park bum for twenty years on his last legs i guess the other policeman stooped and looked at something crumpled and crisp in the hand of the sleeper gee he remarked he s doped out a fifty dollar bill anyway wish i knew the brand of hop that he smokes and then rap rap rap went the club of realism against the shoe soles of prince michael of the electorate of valleluna sisters of the golden circle the rubberneck auto was about ready to start the merry top riders had been assigned to their seats by the gentlemanly conductor the sidewalk was blockaded with sightseers who had gathered to stare at sightseers justifying the natural law that every creature on earth is preyed upon by some other creature the megaphone man raised his instrument of torture the inside of the great automobile began to thump and throb like the heart of a coffee drinker the top riders nervously clung to the seats the old lady from valparaiso indiana shrieked to be put ashore but before a wheel turns listen to a brief preamble through the cardiaphone which shall point out to you an object of interest on life s sightseeing tour swift and comprehensive is the recognition of white man for white man in african wilds instant and sure is the spiritual greeting between mother and babe unhesitatingly do master and dog commune across the slight gulf between animal and man immeasurably quick and sapient are the brief messages between one and one s beloved but all these instances set forth only slow and groping interchange of sympathy and thought beside one other instance which the rubberneck coach shall disclose you shall learn if you have not learned already what two beings of all earth s living inhabitants most quickly look into each other s hearts and souls when they meet face to face the gong whirred and the glaring at gotham car moved majestically upon its instructive tour on the highest rear seat was james williams of cloverdale missouri and his bride capitalise it friend typo that last word word of words in the epiphany of life and love the scent of the flowers the booty of the bee the primal drip of spring waters the overture of the lark the twist of lemon peel on the cocktail of creation such is the bride holy is the wife revered the mother galliptious is the summer girl but the bride is the certified check among the wedding presents that the gods send in when man is married to mortality the car glided up the golden way on the bridge of the great cruiser the captain stood trumpeting the sights of the big city to his passengers wide mouthed and open eared they heard the sights of the metropolis thundered forth to their eyes confused delirious with excitement and provincial longings they tried to make ocular responses to the megaphonic ritual in the solemn spires of spreading cathedrals they saw the home of the vanderbilts in the busy bulk of the grand central depot they viewed wonderingly the frugal cot of russell sage bidden to observe the highlands of the hudson they gaped unsuspecting at the upturned mountains of a new laid sewer to many the elevated railroad was the rialto on the stations of which uniformed men sat and made chop suey of your tickets and to this day in the outlying districts many have it that chuck connors with his hand on his heart leads reform and that but for the noble municipal efforts of one parkhurst a district attorney the notorious bishop potter gang would have destroyed law and order from the bowery to the harlem river but i beg you to observe mrs james williams hattie chalmers that was once the belle of cloverdale pale blue is the bride s if she will and this colour she had honoured willingly had the moss rosebud loaned to her cheeks of its pink and as for the violet her eyes will do very well as they are thank you a useless strip of white chaf oh no he was guiding the auto car of white chiffon or perhaps it was grenadine or tulle was tied beneath her chin pretending to hold her bonnet in place but you know as well as i do that the hatpins did the work and on mrs james williams s face was recorded a little library of the world s best thoughts in three volumes volume no contained the belief that james williams was about the right sort of thing volume no was an essay on the world declaring it to be a very excellent place volume no disclosed the belief that in occupying the highest seat in a rubberneck auto they were travelling the pace that passes all understanding james williams you would have guessed was about twenty four it will gratify you to know that your estimate was so accurate he was exactly twenty three years eleven months and twenty nine days old he was well built active strong jawed good natured and rising he was on his wedding trip dear kind fairy please cut out those orders for money and h p touring cars and fame and a new growth of hair and the presidency of the boat club instead of any of them turn backward oh turn backward and give us just a teeny weeny bit of our wedding trip over again just an hour dear fairy so we can remember how the grass and poplar trees looked and the bow of those bonnet strings tied beneath her chin even if it was the hatpins that did the work can t do it very well hurry up with that touring car and the oil stock then just in front of mrs james williams sat a girl in a loose tan jacket and a straw hat adorned with grapes and roses only in dreams and milliners shops do we alas gather grapes and roses at one swipe this girl gazed with large blue eyes credulous when the megaphone man roared his doctrine that millionaires were things about which we should be concerned between blasts she resorted to epictetian philosophy in the form of pepsin chewing gum at this girl s right hand sat a young man about twenty four he was well built active strong jawed and good natured but if his description seems to follow that of james williams divest it of anything cloverdalian this man belonged to hard streets and sharp corners he looked keenly about him seeming to begrudge the asphalt under the feet of those upon whom he looked down from his perch while the megaphone barks at a famous hostelry let me whisper you through the low tuned cardiaphone to sit tight for now things are about to happen and the great city will close over them again as over a scrap of ticker tape floating down from the den of a broad street bear the girl in the tan jacket twisted around to view the pilgrims on the last seat the other passengers she had absorbed the seat behind her was her bluebeard s chamber her eyes met those of mrs james williams between two ticks of a watch they exchanged their life s experiences histories hopes and fancies and all mind you with the eye before two men could have decided whether to draw steel or borrow a match the bride leaned forward low she and the girl spoke rapidly together their tongues moving quickly like those of two serpents a comparison that is not meant to go further two smiles and a dozen nods closed the conference and now in the broad quiet avenue in front of the rubberneck car a man in dark clothes stood with uplifted hand from the sidewalk another hurried to join him the girl in the fruitful hat quickly seized her companion by the arm and whispered in his ear that young man exhibited proof of ability to act promptly crouching low he slid over the edge of the car hung lightly for an instant and then disappeared half a dozen of the top riders observed his feat wonderingly but made no comment deeming it prudent not to express surprise at what might be the conventional manner of alighting in this bewildering city the truant passenger dodged a hansom and then floated past like a leaf on a stream between a furniture van and a florist s delivery wagon the girl in the tan jacket turned again and looked in the eyes of mrs james williams then she faced about and sat still while the rubberneck auto stopped at the flash of the badge under the coat of the plainclothes man what s eatin you demanded the megaphonist abandoning his professional discourse for pure english keep her at anchor for a minute ordered the officer there s a man on board we want a philadelphia burglar called pinky mcguire there he is on the back seat look out for the side donovan donovan went to the hind wheel and looked up at james williams come down old sport he said pleasantly we ve got you back to sleepytown for yours it ain t a bad idea hidin on a rubberneck though i ll remember that softly through the megaphone came the advice of the conductor better step off sir and explain the car must proceed on its tour james williams belonged among the level heads with necessary slowness he picked his way through the passengers down to the steps at the front of the car his wife followed but she first turned her eyes and saw the escaped tourist glide from behind the furniture van and slip behind a tree on the edge of the little park not fifty feet away descended to the ground james williams faced his captors with a smile he was thinking what a good story he would have to tell in cloverdale about having been mistaken for a burglar the rubberneck coach lingered out of respect for its patrons what could be a more interesting sight than this my name is james williams of cloverdale missouri he said kindly so that they would not be too greatly mortified i have letters here that will show you ll come with us please announced the plainclothes man pinky mcguire s description fits you like flannel washed in hot suds a detective saw you on the rubberneck up at central park and phoned down to take you in do your explaining at the station house james williams s wife his bride of two weeks looked him in the face with a strange soft radiance in her eyes and a flush on her cheeks looked him in the face and said go with em quietly pinky and maybe it ll be in your favour and then as the glaring at gotham car rolled away she turned and threw a kiss his wife threw a kiss at some one high up on the seats of the rubberneck your girl gives you good advice mcguire said donovan come on now and then madness descended upon and occupied james williams he pushed his hat far upon the back of his head my wife seems to think i am a burglar he said recklessly i never heard of her being crazy therefore i must be and if i m crazy they can t do anything to me for killing you two fools in my madness whereupon he resisted arrest so cheerfully and industriously that cops had to be whistled for and afterwards the reserves to disperse a few thousand delighted spectators at the station house the desk sergeant asked for his name mcdoodle the pink or pinky the brute i forget which was james williams s answer but you can bet i m a burglar don t leave that out and you might add that it took five of em to pluck the pink i d especially like to have that in the records in an hour came mrs james williams with uncle thomas of madison avenue in a respect compelling motor car and proofs of the hero s innocence for all the world like the third act of a drama backed by an automobile mfg co after the police had sternly reprimanded james williams for imitating a copyrighted burglar and given him as honourable a discharge as the department was capable of mrs williams rearrested him and swept him into an angle of the station house james williams regarded her with one eye he always said that donovan closed the other while somebody was holding his good right hand never before had he given her a word of reproach or of reproof if you can explain he began rather stiffly why you dear she interrupted listen it was an hour s pain and trial to you i did it for her i mean the girl who spoke to me on the coach i was so happy jim so happy with you that i didn t dare to refuse that happiness to another jim they were married only this morning those two and i wanted him to get away while they were struggling with you i saw him slip from behind his tree and hurry across the park that s all of it dear i had to do it thus does one sister of the plain gold band know another who stands in the enchanted light that shines but once and briefly for each one by rice and satin bows does mere man become aware of weddings but bride knoweth bride at the glance of an eye and between them swiftly passes comfort and meaning in a language that man and widows wot not of the romance of a busy broker pitcher confidential clerk in the office of harvey maxwell broker allowed a look of mild interest and surprise to visit his usually expressionless countenance when his employer briskly entered at half past nine in company with his young lady stenographer with a snappy good morning pitcher maxwell dashed at his desk as though he were intending to leap over it and then plunged into the great heap of letters and telegrams waiting there for him the young lady had been maxwell s stenographer for a year she was beautiful in a way that was decidedly unstenographic she forewent the pomp of the alluring pompadour she wore no chains bracelets or lockets she had not the air of being about to accept an invitation to luncheon her dress was grey and plain but it fitted her figure with fidelity and discretion in her neat black turban hat was the gold green wing of a macaw on this morning she was softly and shyly radiant her eyes were dreamily bright her cheeks genuine peachblow her expression a happy one tinged with reminiscence pitcher still mildly curious noticed a difference in her ways this morning instead of going straight into the adjoining room where her desk was she lingered slightly irresolute in the outer office once she moved over by maxwell s desk near enough for him to be aware of her presence the machine sitting at that desk was no longer a man it was a busy new york broker moved by buzzing wheels and uncoiling springs well what is it anything asked maxwell sharply his opened mail lay like a bank of stage snow on his crowded desk his keen grey eye impersonal and brusque flashed upon her half impatiently nothing answered the stenographer moving away with a little smile mr pitcher she said to the confidential clerk did mr maxwell say anything yesterday about engaging another stenographer he did answered pitcher he told me to get another one i notified the agency yesterday afternoon to send over a few samples this morning it s o clock and not a single picture hat or piece of pineapple chewing gum has showed up yet i will do the work as usual then said the young lady until some one comes to fill the place and she went to her desk at once and hung the black turban hat with the gold green macaw wing in its accustomed place he who has been denied the spectacle of a busy manhattan broker during a rush of business is handicapped for the profession of anthropology the poet sings of the crowded hour of glorious life the broker s hour is not only crowded but the minutes and seconds are hanging to all the straps and packing both front and rear platforms and this day was harvey maxwell s busy day the ticker began to reel out jerkily its fitful coils of tape the desk telephone had a chronic attack of buzzing men began to throng into the office and call at him over the railing jovially sharply viciously excitedly messenger boys ran in and out with messages and telegrams the clerks in the office jumped about like sailors during a storm even pitcher s face relaxed into something resembling animation on the exchange there were hurricanes and landslides and snowstorms and glaciers and volcanoes and those elemental disturbances were reproduced in miniature in the broker s offices maxwell shoved his chair against the wall and transacted business after the manner of a toe dancer he jumped from ticker to phone from desk to door with the trained agility of a harlequin in the midst of this growing and important stress the broker became suddenly aware of a high rolled fringe of golden hair under a nodding canopy of velvet and ostrich tips an imitation sealskin sacque and a string of beads as large as hickory nuts ending near the floor with a silver heart there was a self possessed young lady connected with these accessories and pitcher was there to construe her lady from the stenographer s agency to see about the position said pitcher maxwell turned half around with his hands full of papers and ticker tape what position he asked with a frown position of stenographer said pitcher you told me yesterday to call them up and have one sent over this morning you are losing your mind pitcher said maxwell why should i have given you any such instructions miss leslie has given perfect satisfaction during the year she has been here the place is hers as long as she chooses to retain it there s no place open here madam countermand that order with the agency pitcher and don t bring any more of em in here the silver heart left the office swinging and banging itself independently against the office furniture as it indignantly departed pitcher seized a moment to remark to the bookkeeper that the old man seemed to get more absent minded and forgetful every day of the world the rush and pace of business grew fiercer and faster on the floor they were pounding half a dozen stocks in which maxwell s customers were heavy investors orders to buy and sell were coming and going as swift as the flight of swallows some of his own holdings were imperilled and the man was working like some high geared delicate strong machine strung to full tension going at full speed accurate never hesitating with the proper word and decision and act ready and prompt as clockwork stocks and bonds loans and mortgages margins and securities here was a world of finance and there was no room in it for the human world or the world of nature when the luncheon hour drew near there came a slight lull in the uproar maxwell stood by his desk with his hands full of telegrams and memoranda with a fountain pen over his right ear and his hair hanging in disorderly strings over his forehead his window was open for the beloved janitress spring had turned on a little warmth through the waking registers of the earth and through the window came a wandering perhaps a lost odour a delicate sweet odour of lilac that fixed the broker for a moment immovable for this odour belonged to miss leslie it was her own and hers only the odour brought her vividly almost tangibly before him the world of finance dwindled suddenly to a speck and she was in the next room twenty steps away by george i ll do it now said maxwell half aloud i ll ask her now i wonder i didn t do it long ago he dashed into the inner office with the haste of a short trying to cover he charged upon the desk of the stenographer she looked up at him with a smile a soft pink crept over her cheek and her eyes were kind and frank maxwell leaned one elbow on her desk he still clutched fluttering papers with both hands and the pen was above his ear miss leslie he began hurriedly i have but a moment to spare i want to say something in that moment will you he my wife i haven t had time to make love to you in the ordinary way but i really do love you talk quick please those fellows are clubbing the stuffing out of union pacific oh what are you talking about exclaimed the young lady she rose to her feet and gazed upon him round eyed don t you understand said maxwell restively i want you to marry me i love you miss leslie i wanted to tell you and i snatched a minute when things had slackened up a bit they re calling me for the phone now tell em to wait a minute pitcher won t you miss leslie the stenographer acted very queerly at first she seemed overcome with amazement then tears flowed from her wondering eyes and then she smiled sunnily through them and one of her arms slid tenderly about the broker s neck i know now she said softly it s this old business that has driven everything else out of your head for the time i was frightened at first don t you remember harvey we were married last evening at o clock in the little church around the corner after twenty years the policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively the impressiveness was habitual and not for show for spectators were few the time was barely o clock at night but chilly gusts of wind with a taste of rain in them had well nigh depeopled the streets trying doors as he went twirling his club with many intricate and artful movements turning now and then to cast his watchful eye adown the pacific thoroughfare the officer with his stalwart form and slight swagger made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace the vicinity was one that kept early hours now and then you might see the lights of a cigar store or of an all night lunch counter but the majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since been closed when about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his walk in the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned with an unlighted cigar in his mouth as the policeman walked up to him the man spoke up quickly it s all right officer he said reassuringly i m just waiting for a friend it s an appointment made twenty years ago sounds a little funny to you doesn t it well i ll explain if you d like to make certain it s all straight about that long ago there used to be a restaurant where this store stands big joe brady s restaurant until five years ago said the policeman it was torn down then the man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar the light showed a pale square jawed face with keen eyes and a little white scar near his right eyebrow his scarfpin was a large diamond oddly set twenty years ago to night said the man i dined here at big joe brady s with jimmy wells my best chum and the finest chap in the world he and i were raised here in new york just like two brothers together i was eighteen and jimmy was twenty the next morning i was to start for the west to make my fortune you couldn t have dragged jimmy out of new york he thought it was the only place on earth well we agreed that night that we would meet here again exactly twenty years from that date and time no matter what our conditions might be or from what distance we might have to come we figured that in twenty years each of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made whatever they were going to be it sounds pretty interesting said the policeman rather a long time between meets though it seems to me haven t you heard from your friend since you left well yes for a time we corresponded said the other but after a year or two we lost track of each other you see the west is a pretty big proposition and i kept hustling around over it pretty lively but i know jimmy will meet me here if he s alive for he always was the truest stanchest old chap in the world he ll never forget i came a thousand miles to stand in this door to night and it s worth it if my old partner turns up the waiting man pulled out a handsome watch the lids of it set with small diamonds three minutes to ten he announced it was exactly ten o clock when we parted here at the restaurant door did pretty well out west didn t you asked the policeman you bet i hope jimmy has done half as well he was a kind of plodder though good fellow as he was i ve had to compete with some of the sharpest wits going to get my pile a man gets in a groove in new york it takes the west to put a razor edge on him the policeman twirled his club and took a step or two i ll be on my way hope your friend comes around all right going to call time on him sharp i should say not said the other i ll give him half an hour at least if jimmy is alive on earth he ll be here by that time so long officer good night sir said the policeman passing on along his beat trying doors as he went there was now a fine cold drizzle falling and the wind had risen from its uncertain puffs into a steady blow the few foot passengers astir in that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat collars turned high and pocketed hands and in the door of the hardware store the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment uncertain almost to absurdity with the friend of his youth smoked his cigar and waited about twenty minutes he waited and then a tall man in a long overcoat with collar turned up to his ears hurried across from the opposite side of the street he went directly to the waiting man is that you bob he asked doubtfully is that you jimmy wells cried the man in the door bless my heart exclaimed the new arrival grasping both the other s hands with his own it s bob sure as fate i was certain i d find you here if you were still in existence well well well twenty years is a long time the old gone bob i wish it had lasted so we could have had another dinner there how has the west treated you old man bully it has given me everything i asked it for you ve changed lots jimmy i never thought you were so tall by two or three inches oh i grew a bit after i was twenty doing well in new york jimmy moderately i have a position in one of the city departments come on bob we ll go around to a place i know of and have a good long talk about old times the two men started up the street arm in arm the man from the west his egotism enlarged by success was beginning to outline the history of his career the other submerged in his overcoat listened with interest at the corner stood a drug store brilliant with electric lights when they came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze upon the other s face the man from the west stopped suddenly and released his arm you re not jimmy wells he snapped twenty years is a long time but not long enough to change a man s nose from a roman to a pug it sometimes changes a good man into a bad one said the tall man you ve been under arrest for ten minutes silky bob chicago thinks you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat with you going quietly are you that s sensible now before we go on to the station here s a note i was asked to hand you you may read it here at the window it s from patrolman wells the man from the west unfolded the little piece of paper handed him his hand was steady when he began to read but it trembled a little by the time he had finished the note was rather short bob i was at the appointed place on time when you struck the match to light your cigar i saw it was the face of the man wanted in chicago somehow i couldn t do it myself so i went around and got a plain clothes man to do the job jimmy lost on dress parade mr towers chandler was pressing his evening suit in his hall bedroom one iron was heating on a small gas stove the other was being pushed vigorously back and forth to make the desirable crease that would be seen later on extending in straight lines from mr chandler s patent leather shoes to the edge of his low cut vest so much of the hero s toilet may be intrusted to our confidence the remainder may be guessed by those whom genteel poverty has driven to ignoble expedient our next view of him shall be as he descends the steps of his lodging house immaculately and correctly clothed calm assured handsome in appearance the typical new york young clubman setting out slightly bored to inaugurate the pleasures of the evening chandler s honorarium was per week he was employed in the office of an architect he was twenty two years old he considered architecture to be truly an art and he honestly believed though he would not have dared to admit it in new york that the flatiron building was inferior to design to the great cathedral in milan out of each week s earnings chandler set aside at the end of each ten weeks with the extra capital thus accumulated he purchased one gentleman s evening from the bargain counter of stingy old father time he arrayed himself in the regalia of millionaires and presidents he took himself to the quarter where life is brightest and showiest and there dined with taste and luxury with ten dollars a man may for a few hours play the wealthy idler to perfection the sum is ample for a well considered meal a bottle bearing a respectable label commensurate tips a smoke cab fare and the ordinary etceteras this one delectable evening culled from each dull seventy was to chandler a source of renascent bliss to the society bud comes but one debut it stands alone sweet in her memory when her hair has whitened but to chandler each ten weeks brought a joy as keen as thrilling as new as the first had been to sit among bon vivants under palms in the swirl of concealed music to look upon the habitues of such a paradise and to be looked upon by them what is a girl s first dance and short sleeved tulle compared with this up broadway chandler moved with the vespertine dress parade for this evening he was an exhibit as well as a gazer for the next sixty nine evenings he would be dining in cheviot and worsted at dubious table d hotes at whirlwind lunch counters on sandwiches and beer in his hall bedroom he was willing to do that for he was a true son of the great city of razzle dazzle and to him one evening in the limelight made up for many dark ones chandler protracted his walk until the forties began to intersect the great and glittering primrose way for the evening was yet young and when one is of the beau monde only one day in seventy one loves to protract the pleasure eyes bright sinister curious admiring provocative alluring were bent upon him for his garb and air proclaimed him a devotee to the hour of solace and pleasure at a certain corner he came to a standstill proposing to himself the question of turning back toward the showy and fashionable restaurant in which he usually dined on the evenings of his especial luxury just then a girl scuddled lightly around the corner slipped on a patch of icy snow and fell plump upon the sidewalk chandler assisted her to her feet with instant and solicitous courtesy the girl hobbled to the wall of the building leaned against it and thanked him demurely i think my ankle is strained she said it twisted when i fell does it pain you much inquired chandler only when i rest my weight upon it i think i will be able to walk in a minute or two if i can be of any further service suggested the young man i will call a cab or thank you said the girl softly but heartily i am sure you need not trouble yourself any further it was so awkward of me and my shoe heels are horridly common sense i can t blame them at all chandler looked at the girl and found her swiftly drawing his interest she was pretty in a refined way and her eye was both merry and kind she was inexpensively clothed in a plain black dress that suggested a sort of uniform such as shop girls wear her glossy dark brown hair showed its coils beneath a cheap hat of black straw whose only ornament was a velvet ribbon and bow she could have posed as a model for the self respecting working girl of the best type a sudden idea came into the head of the young architect he would ask this girl to dine with him here was the element that his splendid but solitary periodic feasts had lacked his brief season of elegant luxury would be doubly enjoyable if he could add to it a lady s society this girl was a lady he was sure her manner and speech settled that and in spite of her extremely plain attire he felt that he would be pleased to sit at table with her these thoughts passed swiftly through his mind and he decided to ask her it was a breach of etiquette of course but oftentimes wage earning girls waived formalities in matters of this kind they were generally shrewd judges of men and thought better of their own judgment than they did of useless conventions his ten dollars discreetly expended would enable the two to dine very well indeed the dinner would no doubt be a wonderful experience thrown into the dull routine of the girl s life and her lively appreciation of it would add to his own triumph and pleasure i think he said to her with frank gravity that your foot needs a longer rest than you suppose now i am going to suggest a way in which you can give it that and at the same time do me a favour i was on my way to dine all by my lonely self when you came tumbling around the corner you come with me and we ll have a cozy dinner and a pleasant talk together and by that time your game ankle will carry you home very nicely i am sure the girl looked quickly up into chandler s clear pleasant countenance her eyes twinkled once very brightly and then she smiled ingenuously but we don t know each other it wouldn t be right would it she said doubtfully there is nothing wrong about it said the young man candidly i ll introduce myself permit me mr towers chandler after our dinner which i will try to make as pleasant as possible i will bid you good evening or attend you safely to your door whichever you prefer but dear me said the girl with a glance at chandler s faultless attire in this old dress and hat never mind that said chandler cheerfully i m sure you look more charming in them than any one we shall see in the most elaborate dinner toilette my ankle does hurt yet admitted the girl attempting a limping step i think i will accept your invitation mr chandler you may call me miss marian come then miss marian said the young architect gaily but with perfect courtesy you will not have far to walk there is a very respectable and good restaurant in the next block you will have to lean on my arm so and walk slowly it is lonely dining all by one s self i m just a little bit glad that you slipped on the ice when the two were established at a well appointed table with a promising waiter hovering in attendance chandler began to experience the real joy that his regular outing always brought to him the restaurant was not so showy or pretentious as the one further down broadway which he always preferred but it was nearly so the tables were well filled with prosperous looking diners there was a good orchestra playing softly enough to make conversation a possible pleasure and the cuisine and service were beyond criticism his companion even in her cheap hat and dress held herself with an air that added distinction to the natural beauty of her face and figure and it is certain that she looked at chandler with his animated but self possessed manner and his kindling and frank blue eyes with something not far from admiration in her own charming face then it was that the madness of manhattan the frenzy of fuss and feathers the bacillus of brag the provincial plague of pose seized upon towers chandler he was on broadway surrounded by pomp and style and there were eyes to look at him on the stage of that comedy he had assumed to play the one night part of a butterfly of fashion and an idler of means and taste he was dressed for the part and all his good angels had not the power to prevent him from acting it so he began to prate to miss marian of clubs of teas of golf and riding and kennels and cotillions and tours abroad and threw out hints of a yacht lying at larchmont he could see that she was vastly impressed by this vague talk so he endorsed his pose by random insinuations concerning great wealth and mentioned familiarly a few names that are handled reverently by the proletariat it was chandler s short little day and he was wringing from it the best that could be had as he saw it and yet once or twice he saw the pure gold of this girl shine through the mist that his egotism had raised between him and all objects this way of living that you speak of she said sounds so futile and purposeless haven t you any work to do in the world that might interest you more my dear miss marian he exclaimed work think of dressing every day for dinner of making half a dozen calls in an afternoon with a policeman at every corner ready to jump into your auto and take you to the station if you get up any greater speed than a donkey cart s gait we do nothings are the hardest workers in the land the dinner was concluded the waiter generously fed and the two walked out to the corner where they had met miss marian walked very well now her limp was scarcely noticeable thank you for a nice time she said frankly i must run home now i liked the dinner very much mr chandler he shook hands with her smiling cordially and said something about a game of bridge at his club he watched her for a moment walking rather rapidly eastward and then he found a cab to drive him slowly homeward in his chilly bedroom chandler laid away his evening clothes for a sixty nine days rest he went about it thoughtfully that was a stunning girl he said to himself she s all right too i d be sworn even if she does have to work perhaps if i d told her the truth instead of all that razzle dazzle we might but confound it i had to play up to my clothes thus spoke the brave who was born and reared in the wigwams of the tribe of the manhattans the girl after leaving her entertainer sped swiftly cross town until she arrived at a handsome and sedate mansion two squares to the east facing on that avenue which is the highway of mammon and the auxiliary gods here she entered hurriedly and ascended to a room where a handsome young lady in an elaborate house dress was looking anxiously out the window oh you madcap exclaimed the elder girl when the other entered when will you quit frightening us this way it is two hours since you ran out in that rag of an old dress and marie s hat mamma has been so alarmed she sent louis in the auto to try to find you you are a bad thoughtless puss the elder girl touched a button and a maid came in a moment marie tell mamma that miss marian has returned don t scold sister i only ran down to mme theo s to tell her to use mauve insertion instead of pink my costume and marie s hat were just what i needed every one thought i was a shopgirl i am sure dinner is over dear you stayed so late i know i slipped on the sidewalk and turned my ankle i could not walk so i hobbled into a restaurant and sat there until i was better that is why i was so long the two girls sat in the window seat looking out at the lights and the stream of hurrying vehicles in the avenue the younger one cuddled down with her head in her sister s lap we will have to marry some day she said dreamily both of us we have so much money that we will not be allowed to disappoint the public do you want me to tell you the kind of a man i could love sis go on you scatterbrain smiled the other i could love a man with dark and kind blue eyes who is gentle and respectful to poor girls who is handsome and good and does not try to flirt but i could love him only if he had an ambition an object some work to do in the world i would not care how poor he was if i could help him build his way up but sister dear the kind of man we always meet the man who lives an idle life between society and his clubs i could not love a man like that even if his eyes were blue and he were ever so kind to poor girls whom he met in the street by courier it was neither the season nor the hour when the park had frequenters and it is likely that the young lady who was seated on one of the benches at the side of the walk had merely obeyed a sudden impulse to sit for a while and enjoy a foretaste of coming spring she rested there pensive and still a certain melancholy that touched her countenance must have been of recent birth for it had not yet altered the fine and youthful contours of her cheek nor subdued the arch though resolute curve of her lips a tall young man came striding through the park along the path near which she sat behind him tagged a boy carrying a suit case at sight of the young lady the man s face changed to red and back to pale again he watched her countenance as he drew nearer with hope and anxiety mingled on his own he passed within a few yards of her but he saw no evidence that she was aware of his presence or existence some fifty yards further on he suddenly stopped and sat on a bench at one side the boy dropped the suit case and stared at him with wondering shrewd eyes the young man took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow it was a good handkerchief a good brow and the young man was good to look at he said to the boy i want you to take a message to that young lady on that bench tell her i am on my way to the station to leave for san francisco where i shall join that alaska moose hunting expedition tell her that since she has commanded me neither to speak nor to write to her i take this means of making one last appeal to her sense of justice for the sake of what has been tell her that to condemn and discard one who has not deserved such treatment without giving him her reasons or a chance to explain is contrary to her nature as i believe it to be tell her that i have thus to a certain degree disobeyed her injunctions in the hope that she may yet be inclined to see justice done go and tell her that the young man dropped a half dollar into the boy s hand the boy looked at him for a moment with bright canny eyes out of a dirty intelligent face and then set off at a run he approached the lady on the bench a little doubtfully but unembarrassed he touched the brim of the old plaid bicycle cap perched on the back of his head the lady looked at him coolly without prejudice or favour lady he said dat gent on de oder bench sent yer a song and dance by me if yer don t know de guy and he s tryin to do de johnny act say de word and i ll call a cop in t ree minutes if yer does know him and he s on de square w y i ll spiel yer de bunch of hot air he sent yer the young lady betrayed a faint interest a song and dance she said in a deliberate sweet voice that seemed to clothe her words in a diaphanous garment of impalpable irony a new idea in the troubadour line i suppose i used to know the gentleman who sent you so i think it will hardly be necessary to call the police you may execute your song and dance but do not sing too loudly it is a little early yet for open air vaudeville and we might attract attention awe said the boy with a shrug down the length of him yer know what i mean lady tain t a turn it s wind he told me to tell yer he s got his collars and cuffs in dat grip for a scoot clean out to frisco den he s goin to shoot snow birds in de klondike he says yer told him not to send round no more pink notes nor come hangin over de garden gate and he takes dis means of puttin yer wise he says yer refereed him out like a has been and never give him no chance to kick at de decision he says yer swiped him and never said why the slightly awakened interest in the young lady s eyes did not abate perhaps it was caused by either the originality or the audacity of the snow bird hunter in thus circumventing her express commands against the ordinary modes of communication she fixed her eye on a statue standing disconsolate in the dishevelled park and spoke into the transmitter tell the gentleman that i need not repeat to him a description of my ideals he knows what they have been and what they still are so far as they touch on this case absolute loyalty and truth are the ones paramount tell him that i have studied my own heart as well as one can and i know its weakness as well as i do its needs that is why i decline to hear his pleas whatever they may be i did not condemn him through hearsay or doubtful evidence and that is why i made no charge but since he persists in hearing what he already well knows you may convey the matter tell him that i entered the conservatory that evening from the rear to cut a rose for my mother tell him i saw him and miss ashburton beneath the pink oleander the tableau was pretty but the pose and juxtaposition were too eloquent and evident to require explanation i left the conservatory and at the same time the rose and my ideal you may carry that song and dance to your impresario i m shy on one word lady jux jux put me wise on dat will yer juxtaposition or you may call it propinquity or if you like being rather too near for one maintaining the position of an ideal the gravel spun from beneath the boy s feet he stood by the other bench the man s eyes interrogated him hungrily the boy s were shining with the impersonal zeal of the translator de lady says dat she s on to de fact dat gals is dead easy when a feller comes spielin ghost stories and tryin to make up and dat s why she won t listen to no soft soap she says she caught yer dead to rights huggin a bunch o calico in de hot house she side stepped in to pull some posies and yer was squeezin de oder gal to beat de band she says it looked cute all right all right but it made her sick she says yer better git busy and make a sneak for de train the young man gave a low whistle and his eyes flashed with a sudden thought his hand flew to the inside pocket of his coat and drew out a handful of letters selecting one he handed it to the boy following it with a silver dollar from his vest pocket give that letter to the lady he said and ask her to read it tell her that it should explain the situation tell her that if she had mingled a little trust with her conception of the ideal much heartache might have been avoided tell her that the loyalty she prizes so much has never wavered tell her i am waiting for an answer the messenger stood before the lady de gent says he s had de ski bunk put on him widout no cause he says he s no bum guy and lady yer read dat letter and i ll bet yer he s a white sport all right the young lady unfolded the letter somewhat doubtfully and read it dear dr arnold i want to thank you for your most kind and opportune aid to my daughter last friday evening when she was overcome by an attack of her old heart trouble in the conservatory at mrs waldron s reception had you not been near to catch her as she fell and to render proper attention we might have lost her i would be glad if you would call and undertake the treatment of her case gratefully yours robert ashburton the young lady refolded the letter and handed it to the boy de gent wants an answer said the messenger wot s de word the lady s eyes suddenly flashed on him bright smiling and wet tell that guy on the other bench she said with a happy tremulous laugh that his girl wants him the furnished room restless shifting fugacious as time itself is a certain vast bulk of the population of the red brick district of the lower west side homeless they have a hundred homes they flit from furnished room to furnished room transients forever transients in abode transients in heart and mind they sing home sweet home in ragtime they carry their lares et penates in a bandbox their vine is entwined about a picture hat a rubber plant is their fig tree hence the houses of this district having had a thousand dwellers should have a thousand tales to tell mostly dull ones no doubt but it would be strange if there could not be found a ghost or two in the wake of all these vagrant guests one evening after dark a young man prowled among these crumbling red mansions ringing their bells at the twelfth he rested his lean hand baggage upon the step and wiped the dust from his hatband and forehead the bell sounded faint and far away in some remote hollow depths to the door of this the twelfth house whose bell he had rung came a housekeeper who made him think of an unwholesome surfeited worm that had eaten its nut to a hollow shell and now sought to fill the vacancy with edible lodgers he asked if there was a room to let come in said the housekeeper her voice came from her throat her throat seemed lined with fur i have the third floor back vacant since a week back should you wish to look at it the young man followed her up the stairs a faint light from no particular source mitigated the shadows of the halls they trod noiselessly upon a stair carpet that its own loom would have forsworn it seemed to have become vegetable to have degenerated in that rank sunless air to lush lichen or spreading moss that grew in patches to the staircase and was viscid under the foot like organic matter at each turn of the stairs were vacant niches in the wall perhaps plants had once been set within them if so they had died in that foul and tainted air it may be that statues of the saints had stood there but it was not difficult to conceive that imps and devils had dragged them forth in the darkness and down to the unholy depths of some furnished pit below this is the room said the housekeeper from her furry throat it s a nice room it ain t often vacant i had some most elegant people in it last summer no trouble at all and paid in advance to the minute the water s at the end of the hall sprowls and mooney kept it three months they done a vaudeville sketch miss b retta sprowls you may have heard of her oh that was just the stage names right there over the dresser is where the marriage certificate hung framed the gas is here and you see there is plenty of closet room it s a room everybody likes it never stays idle long do you have many theatrical people rooming here asked the young man they comes and goes a good proportion of my lodgers is connected with the theatres yes sir this is the theatrical district actor people never stays long anywhere i get my share yes they comes and they goes he engaged the room paying for a week in advance he was tired he said and would take possession at once he counted out the money the room had been made ready she said even to towels and water as the housekeeper moved away he put for the thousandth time the question that he carried at the end of his tongue a young girl miss vashner miss eloise vashner do you remember such a one among your lodgers she would be singing on the stage most likely a fair girl of medium height and slender with reddish gold hair and a dark mole near her left eyebrow no i don t remember the name them stage people has names they change as often as their rooms they comes and they goes no i don t call that one to mind no always no five months of ceaseless interrogation and the inevitable negative so much time spent by day in questioning managers agents schools and choruses by night among the audiences of theatres from all star casts down to music halls so low that he dreaded to find what he most hoped for he who had loved her best had tried to find her he was sure that since her disappearance from home this great water girt city held her somewhere but it was like a monstrous quicksand shifting its particles constantly with no foundation its upper granules of to day buried to morrow in ooze and slime the furnished room received its latest guest with a first glow of pseudo hospitality a hectic haggard perfunctory welcome like the specious smile of a demirep the sophistical comfort came in reflected gleams from the decayed furniture the raggcd brocade upholstery of a couch and two chairs a footwide cheap pier glass between the two windows from one or two gilt picture frames and a brass bedstead in a corner the guest reclined inert upon a chair while the room confused in speech as though it were an apartment in babel tried to discourse to him of its divers tenantry a polychromatic rug like some brilliant flowered rectangular tropical islet lay surrounded by a billowy sea of soiled matting upon the gay papered wall were those pictures that pursue the homeless one from house to house the huguenot lovers the first quarrel the wedding breakfast psyche at the fountain the mantel s chastely severe outline was ingloriously veiled behind some pert drapery drawn rakishly askew like the sashes of the amazonian ballet upon it was some desolate flotsam cast aside by the room s marooned when a lucky sail had borne them to a fresh port a trifling vase or two pictures of actresses a medicine bottle some stray cards out of a deck one by one as the characters of a cryptograph become explicit the little signs left by the furnished room s procession of guests developed a significance the threadbare space in the rug in front of the dresser told that lovely woman had marched in the throng tiny finger prints on the wall spoke of little prisoners trying to feel their way to sun and air a splattered stain raying like the shadow of a bursting bomb witnessed where a hurled glass or bottle had splintered with its contents against the wall across the pier glass had been scrawled with a diamond in staggering letters the name marie it seemed that the succession of dwellers in the furnished room had turned in fury perhaps tempted beyond forbearance by its garish coldness and wreaked upon it their passions the furniture was chipped and bruised the couch distorted by bursting springs seemed a horrible monster that had been slain during the stress of some grotesque convulsion some more potent upheaval had cloven a great slice from the marble mantel each plank in the floor owned its particular cant and shriek as from a separate and individual agony it seemed incredible that all this malice and injury had been wrought upon the room by those who had called it for a time their home and yet it may have been the cheated home instinct surviving blindly the resentful rage at false household gods that had kindled their wrath a hut that is our own we can sweep and adorn and cherish the young tenant in the chair allowed these thoughts to file soft shod through his mind while there drifted into the room furnished sounds and furnished scents he heard in one room a tittering and incontinent slack laughter in others the monologue of a scold the rattling of dice a lullaby and one crying dully above him a banjo tinkled with spirit doors banged somewhere the elevated trains roared intermittently a cat yowled miserably upon a back fence and he breathed the breath of the house a dank savour rather than a smell a cold musty effluvium as from underground vaults mingled with the reeking exhalations of linoleum and mildewed and rotten woodwork then suddenly as he rested there the room was filled with the strong sweet odour of mignonette it came as upon a single buffet of wind with such sureness and fragrance and emphasis that it almost seemed a living visitant and the man cried aloud what dear as if he had been called and sprang up and faced about the rich odour clung to him and wrapped him around he reached out his arms for it all his senses for the time confused and commingled how could one be peremptorily called by an odour surely it must have been a sound but was it not the sound that had touched that had caressed him she has been in this room he cried and he sprang to wrest from it a token for he knew he would recognize the smallest thing that had belonged to her or that she had touched this enveloping scent of mignonette the odour that she had loved and made her own whence came it the room had been but carelessly set in order scattered upon the flimsy dresser scarf were half a dozen hairpins those discreet indistinguishable friends of womankind feminine of gender infinite of mood and uncommunicative of tense these he ignored conscious of their triumphant lack of identity ransacking the drawers of the dresser he came upon a discarded tiny ragged handkerchief he pressed it to his face it was racy and insolent with heliotrope he hurled it to the floor in another drawer he found odd buttons a theatre programme a pawnbroker s card two lost marshmallows a book on the divination of dreams in the last was a woman s black satin hair bow which halted him poised between ice and fire but the black satin hairbow also is femininity s demure impersonal common ornament and tells no tales and then he traversed the room like a hound on the scent skimming the walls considering the corners of the bulging matting on his hands and knees rummaging mantel and tables the curtains and hangngs the drunken cabinet in the corner for a visible sign unable to perceive that she was there beside around against within above him clinging to him wooing him calling him so poignantly through the finer senses that even his grosser ones became cognisant of the call once again he answered loudly yes dear and turned wild eyed to gaze on vacancy for he could not yet discern form and colour and love and outstretched arms in the odour of mnignonette oh god whence that odour and since when have odours had a voice to call thus he groped he burrowed in crevices and corners and found corks and cigarettes these he passed in passive contempt but once he found in a fold of the matting a half smoked cigar and this he ground beneath his heel with a green and trenchant oath he sifted the room from end to end he found dreary and ignoble small records of many a peripatetic tenant but of her whom he sought and who may have lodged there and whose spirit seemed to hover there he found no trace and then he thought of the housekeeper he ran from the haunted room downstairs and to a door that showed a crack of light she came out to his knock he smothered his excitement as best he could will you tell me madam he besought her who occupied the room i have before i came yes sir i can tell you again twas sprowls and mooney as i said miss b retta sprowls it was in the theatres but missis mooney she was my house is well known for respectability the marriage certificate hung framed on a nail over what kind of a lady was miss sprowls in looks i mean why black haired sir short and stout with a comical face they left a week ago tuesday and before they occupied it why there was a single gentleman connected with the draying business he left owing me a week before him was missis crowder and her two children that stayed four months and back of them was old mr doyle whose sons paid for him he kept the room six months that goes back a year sir and further i do not remember he thanked her and crept back to his room the room was dead the essence that had vivified it was gone the perfume of mignonette had departed in its place was the old stale odour of mouldy house furniture of atmosphere in storage the ebbing of his hope drained his faith he sat staring at the yellow singing gaslight soon he walked to the bed and began to tear the sheets into strips with the blade of his knife he drove them tightly into every crevice around windows and door when all was snug and taut he turned out the light turned the gas full on again and laid himself gratefully upon the bed it was mrs mccool s night to go with the can for beer so she fetched it and sat with mrs purdy in one of those subterranean retreats where house keepers foregather and the worm dieth seldom i rented out my third floor back this evening said mrs purdy across a fine circle of foam a young man took it he went up to bed two hours ago now did ye mrs purdy ma am said mrs mccool with intense admiration you do be a wonder for rentin rooms of that kind and did ye tell him then she concluded in a husky whisper laden with mystery rooms said mrs purdy in her furriest tones are furnished for to rent i did not tell him mrs mccool tis right ye are ma am tis by renting rooms we kape alive ye have the rale sense for business ma am there be many people will rayjict the rentin of a room if they be tould a suicide has been after dyin in the bed of it as you say we has our living to be making remarked mrs purdy yis ma am tis true tis just one wake ago this day i helped ye lay out the third floor back a pretty slip of a colleen she was to be killin herself wid the gas a swate little face she had mrs purdy ma am she d a been called handsome as you say said mrs purdy assenting but critical but for that mole she had a growin by her left eyebrow do fill up your glass again mrs mccool the brief debut of tildy if you do not know bogle s chop house and family restaurant it is your loss for if you are one of the fortunate ones who dine expensively you should be interested to know how the other half consumes provisions and if you belong to the half to whom waiters checks are things of moment you should know bogle s for there you get your money s worth in quantity at least bogle s is situated in that highway of bourgeoisie that boulevard of brown jones and robinson eighth avenue there are two rows of tables in the room six in each row on each table is a caster stand containing cruets of condiments and seasons from the pepper cruet you may shake a cloud of something tasteless and melancholy like volcanic dust from the salt cruet you may expect nothing though a man should extract a sanguinary stream from the pallid turnip yet wili his prowess be balked when he comes to wrest salt from bogle s cruets also upon each table stands the counterfeit of that benign sauce made from the recipe of a nobleman in india at the cashier s desk sits bogle cold sordid slow smouldering and takes your money behind a mountain of toothpicks he makes your change files your check and ejects at you like a toad a word about the weather beyond a corroboration of his meteorological statement you would better not venture you are not bogle s friend you are a fed transient customer and you and he may not meet again until the blowing of gabriel s dinner horn so take your change and go to the devil if you like there you have bogle s sentiments the needs of bogle s customers were supplied by two waitresses and a voice one of the waitresses was named aileen she was tall beautiful lively gracious and learned in persiflage her other name there was no more necessity for another name at bogle s than there was for finger bowls the name of the other waitress was tildy why do you suggest matilda please listen this time tildy tildy tildy was dumpy plain faced and too anxious to please to please repeat the last clause to yourself once or twice and make the acquaintance of the duplicate infinite the voice at bogle s was invisible it came from the kitchen and did not shine in the way of originality it was a heathen voice and contented itself with vain repetitions of exclamations emitted by the waitresses concerning food will it tire you to be told again that aileen was beautiful had she donned a few hundred dollars worth of clothes and joined the easter parade and had you seen her you would have hastened to say so yourself the customers at bogle s were her slaves six tables full she could wait upon at once they who were in a hurry restrained their impatience for the joy of merely gazing upon her swiftly moving graceful figure they who had finished eating ate more that they might continue in the light of her smiles every man there and they were mostly men tried to make his impression upon her aileen could successfully exchange repartee against a dozen at once and every smile that she sent forth lodged like pellets from a scatter gun in as many hearts and all this while she would be performing astounding feats with orders of pork and beans pot roasts ham and sausage and the wheats and any quantity of things on the iron and in the pan and straight up and on the side with all this feasting and flirting and merry exchange of wit bogle s came mighty near being a salon with aileen for its madame recamier if the transients were entranced by the fascinating aileen the regulars were her adorers there was much rivalry among many of the steady customers aileen could have had an engagement every evening at least twice a week some one took her to a theatre or to a dance one stout gentleman whom she and tildy had privately christened the hog presented her with a turquoise ring another one known as fresby who rode on the traction company s repair wagon was going to give her a poodle as soon as his brother got the hauling contract in the ninth and the man who always ate spareribs and spinach and said he was a stock broker asked her to go to parsifal with him i don t know where this place is said aileen while talking it over with tildy but the wedding ring s got to be on before i put a stitch into a travelling dress ain t that right well i guess but tildy in steaming chattering cabbage scented bogle s there was almost a heart tragedy tildy with the blunt nose the hay coloured hair the freckled skin the bag o meal figure had never had an admirer not a man followed her with his eyes when she went to and fro in the restaurant save now and then when they glared with the beast hunger for food none of them bantered her gaily to coquettish interchanges of wit none of them loudly jollied her of mornings as they did aileen accusing her when the eggs were slow in coming of late hours in the company of envied swains no one had ever given her a turquoise ring or invited her upon a voyage to mysterious distant parsifal tildy was a good waitress and the men tolerated her they who sat at her tables spoke to her briefly with quotations from the bill of fare and then raised their voices in honeyed and otherwise flavoured accents eloquently addressed to the fair aileen they writhed in their chairs to gaze around and over the impending form of tildy that aileen s pulchritude might season and make ambrosia of their bacon and eggs and tildy was content to be the unwooed drudge if aileen could receive the flattery and the homage the blunt nose was loyal to the short grecian she was aileen s friend and she was glad to see her rule hearts and wean the attention of men from smoking pot pie and lemon meringue but deep below our freckles and hay coloured hair the unhandsomest of us dream of a prince or a princess not vicarious but coming to us alone there was a morning when aileen tripped in to work with a slightly bruised eye and tildy s solicitude was almost enough to heal any optic fresh guy explained aileen last night as i was going home at twenty third and sixth sashayed up so he did and made a break i turned him down cold and he made a sneak but followed me down to eighteenth and tried his hot air again gee but i slapped him a good one side of the face then he give me that eye does it look real awful til i should hate that mr nicholson should see it when he comes in for his tea and toast at ten tildy listened to the adventure with breathless admiration no man had ever tried to follow her she was safe abroad at any hour of the twenty four what bliss it must have been to have had a man follow one and black one s eye for love among the customers at bogle s was a young man named seeders who worked in a laundry office mr seeders was thin and had light hair and appeared to have been recently rough dried and starched he was too diffident to aspire to aileen s notice so he usually sat at one of tildy s tables where he devoted himself to silence and boiled weakfish one day when mr seeders came in to dinner he had been drinking beer there were only two or three customers in the restaurant when mr seeders had finished his weakfish he got up put his arm around tildy s waist kissed her loudly and impudently walked out upon the street snapped his fingers in the direction of the laundry and hied himself to play pennies in the slot machines at the amusement arcade for a few moments tildy stood petrified then she was aware of aileen shaking at her an arch forefinger and saying why til you naughty girl ain t you getting to be awful miss slyboots first thing i know you ll be stealing some of my fellows i must keep an eye on you my lady another thing dawned upon tildy s recovering wits in a moment she had advanced from a hopeless lowly admirer to be an eve sister of the potent aileen she herself was now a man charmer a mark for cupid a sabine who must be coy when the romans were at their banquet boards man had found her waist achievable and her lips desirable the sudden and amatory seeders had as it were performed for her a miraculous piece of one day laundry work he had taken the sackcloth of her uncomeliness had washed dried starched and ironed it and returned it to her sheer embroidered lawn the robe of venus herself the freckles on tildy s cheeks merged into a rosy flush now both circe and psyche peeped from her brightened eyes not even aileen herself had been publicly embraced and kissed in the restaurant tildy could not keep the delightful secret when trade was slack she went and stood at bogle s desk her eyes were shining she tried not to let her words sound proud and boastful a gentleman insulted me to day she said he hugged me around the waist and kissed me that so said bogle cracking open his business armour after this week you get a dollar a week more at the next regular meal when tildy set food before customers with whom she had acquaintance she said to each of them modestly as one whose merit needed no bolstering a gentleman insulted me to day in the restaurant he put his arm around my waist and kissed me the diners accepted the revelation in various ways some incredulously some with congratulations others turned upon her the stream of badinage that had hitherto been directed at aileen alone and tildy s heart swelled in her bosom for she saw at last the towers of romance rise above the horizon of the grey plain in which she had for so long travelled for two days mr seeders came not again during that time tildy established herself firmly as a woman to be wooed she bought ribbons and arranged her hair like aileen s and tightened her waist two inches she had a thrilling but delightful fear that mr seeders would rush in suddenly and shoot her with a pistol he must have loved her desperately and impulsive lovers are always blindly jealous even aileen had not been shot at with a pistol and then tildy rather hoped that he would not shoot at her for she was always loyal to aileen and she did not want to overshadow her friend at o clock on the afternoon of the third day mr seeders came in there were no customers at the tables at the back end of the restaurant tildy was refilling the mustard pots and aileen was quartering pies mr seeders walked back to where they stood tildy looked up and saw him gasped and pressed the mustard spoon against her heart a red hair bow was in her hair she wore venus s eighth avenue badge the blue bead necklace with the swinging silver symbolic heart mr seeders was flushed and embarrassed he plunged one hand into his hip pocket and the other into a fresh pumpkin pie miss tildy said he i want to apologise for what i done the other evenin tell you the truth i was pretty well tanked up or i wouldn t of done it i wouldn t do no lady that a way when i was sober so i hope miss tildy you ll accept my pology and believe that i wouldn t of done it if i d known what i was doin and hadn t of been drunk with this handsome plea mr seeders backed away and departed feeling that reparation had been made but behind the convenient screen tildy had thrown herself flat upon a table among the butter chips and the coffee cups and was sobbing her heart out out and back again to the grey plain wherein travel they with blunt noses and hay coloured hair from her knot she had torn the red hair bow and cast it upon the floor seeders she despised utterly she had but taken his kiss as that of a pioneer and prophetic prince who might have set the clocks going and the pages to running in fairyland but the kiss had been maudlin and unmeant the court had not stirred at the false alarm she must forevermore remain the sleeping beauty yet not all was lost aileen s arm was around her and tildy s red hand groped among the butter chips till it found the warm clasp of her friend s don t you fret til said aileen who did not understand entirely that turnip faced little clothespin of a seeders ain t worth it he ain t anything of a gentleman or he wouldn t ever of apologised the gentle grafter the octopus marooned a trust is its weakest point said jeff peters that said i sounds like one of those unintelligible remarks such as why is a policeman it is not said jeff there are no relations between a trust and a policeman my remark was an epitogram an axis a kind of mulct em in parvo what it means is that a trust is like an egg and it is not like an egg if you want to break an egg you have to do it from the outside the only way to break up a trust is from the inside keep sitting on it until it hatches look at the brood of young colleges and libraries that s chirping and peeping all over the country yes sir every trust bears in its own bosom the seeds of its destruction like a rooster that crows near a georgia colored methodist camp meeting or a republican announcing himself a candidate for governor of texas i asked jeff jestingly if he had ever during his checkered plaided mottled pied and dappled career conducted an enterprise of the class to which the word trust had been applied somewhat to my surprise he acknowledged the corner once said he and the state seal of new jersey never bit into a charter that opened up a solider and safer piece of legitimate octopusing we had everything in our favor wind water police nerve and a clean monopoly of an article indispensable to the public there wasn t a trust buster on the globe that could have found a weak spot in our scheme it made rockefeller s little kerosene speculation look like a bucket shop but we lost out some unforeseen opposition came up i suppose i said no sir it was just as i said we were self curbed it was a case of auto suppression there was a rift within the loot as albert tennyson says you remember i told you that me and andy tucker was partners for some years that man was the most talented conniver at stratagems i ever saw whenever he saw a dollar in another man s hands he took it as a personal grudge if he couldn t take it any other way andy was educated too besides having a lot of useful information he had acquired a big amount of experience out of books and could talk for hours on any subject connected with ideas and discourse he had been in every line of graft from lecturing on palestine with a lot of magic lantern pictures of the annual custom made clothiers association convention at atlantic city to flooding connecticut with bogus wood alcohol distilled from nutmegs one spring me and andy had been over in mexico on a flying trip during which a philadelphia capitalist had paid us for a half interest in a silver mine in chihuahua oh yes the mine was all right the other half interest must have been worth two or three thousand i often wondered who owned that mine in coming back to the united states me and andy stubbed our toes against a little town in texas on the bank of the rio grande the name of it was bird city but it wasn t the town had about inhabitants mostly men i figured out that their principal means of existence was in living close to tall chaparral some of em were stockmen and some gamblers and some horse peculators and plenty were in the smuggling line me and andy put up at a hotel that was built like something between a roof garden and a sectional bookcase it began to rain the day we got there as the saying is juniper aquarius was sure turning on the water plugs on mount amphibious now there were three saloons in bird city though neither andy nor me drank but we could see the townspeople making a triangular procession from one to another all day and half the night everybody seemed to know what to do with as much money as they had the third day of the rain it slacked up awhile in the afternoon so me and andy walked out to the edge of town to view the mudscape bird city was built between the rio grande and a deep wide arroyo that used to be the old bed of the river the bank between the stream and its old bed was cracking and giving away when we saw it on account of the high water caused by the rain andy looks at it a long time that man s intellects was never idle and then he unfolds to me a instantaneous idea that has occurred to him right there was organized a trust and we walked back into town and put it on the market first we went to the main saloon in bird city called the blue snake and bought it it cost us and then we dropped in casual at mexican joe s place referred to the rain and bought him out for the other one came easy at the next morning bird city woke up and found itself an island the river had busted through its old channel and the town was surrounded by roaring torrents the rain was still raining and there was heavy clouds in the northwest that presaged about six more mean annual rainfalls during the next two weeks but the worst was yet to come bird city hopped out of its nest waggled its pin feathers and strolled out for its matutinal toot lo mexican joe s place was closed and likewise the other little dobe life saving station so naturally the body politic emits thirsty ejaculations of surprise and ports hellum for the blue snake and what does it find there behind one end of the bar sits jefferson peters octopus with a sixshooter on each side of him ready to make change or corpses as the case may be there are three bartenders and on the wall is a ten foot sign reading all drinks one dollar andy sits on the safe in his neat blue suit and gold banded cigar on the lookout for emergencies the town marshal is there with two deputies to keep order having been promised free drinks by the trust well sir it took bird city just ten minutes to realize that it was in a cage we expected trouble but there wasn t any the citizens saw that we had em the nearest railroad was thirty miles away and it would be two weeks at least before the river would be fordable so they began to cuss amiable and throw down dollars on the bar till it sounded like a selection on the xylophone there was about grown up adults in bird city that had arrived at years of indiscretion and the majority of em required from three to twenty drinks a day to make life endurable the blue snake was the only place where they could get em till the flood subsided it was beautiful and simple as all truly great swindles are about ten o clock the silver dollars dropping on the bar slowed down to playing two steps and marches instead of jigs but i looked out the window and saw a hundred or two of our customers standing in line at bird city savings and loan co and i knew they were borrowing more money to be sucked in by the clammy tendrils of the octopus at the fashionable hour of noon everybody went home to dinner we told the bartenders to take advantage of the lull and do the same then me and andy counted the receipts we had taken in we calculated that if bird city would only remain an island for two weeks the trust would be able to endow the chicago university with a new dormitory of padded cells for the faculty and present every worthy poor man in texas with a farm provided he furnished the site for it andy was especial inroaded by self esteem at our success the rudiments of the scheme having originated in his own surmises and premonitions he got off the safe and lit the biggest cigar in the house jeff says he i don t suppose that anywhere in the world you could find three cormorants with brighter ideas about down treading the proletariat than the firm of peters satan and tucker incorporated we have sure handed the small consumer a giant blow in the sole apoplectic region no well says i it does look as if we would have to take up gastritis and golf or be measured for kilts in spite of ourselves this little turn in bug juice is verily all to the skibo and i can stand it says i i d rather batten than bant any day andy pours himself out four fingers of our best rye and does with it as was so intended it was the first drink i had ever known him to take by way of liberation says he to the gods and then after thus doing umbrage to the heathen diabetes he drinks another to our success and then he begins to toast the trade beginning with raisuli and the northern pacific and on down the line to the little ones like the school book combine and the oleomargarine outrages and the lehigh valley and great scott coal federation it s all right andy says i to drink the health of our brother monopolists but don t overdo the wassail you know our most eminent and loathed multi corruptionists live on weak tea and dog biscuits andy went in the back room awhile and came out dressed in his best clothes there was a kind of murderous and soulful look of gentle riotousness in his eye that i didn t like i watched him to see what turn the whiskey was going to take in him there are two times when you never can tell what is going to happen one is when a man takes his first drink and the other is when a woman takes her latest in less than an hour andy s skate had turned to an ice yacht he was outwardly decent and managed to preserve his aquarium but inside he was impromptu and full of unexpectedness jeff says he do you know that i m a crater a living crater that s a self evident hypothesis says i but you re not irish why don t you say creature according to the rules and syntax of america i m the crater of a volcano says he i m all aflame and crammed inside with an assortment of words and phrases that have got to have an exodus i can feel millions of synonyms and parts of speech rising in me says he and i ve got to make a speech of some sort drink says andy always drives me to oratory it could do no worse says i from my earliest recollections says he alcohol seemed to stimulate my sense of recitation and rhetoric why in bryan s second campaign says andy they used to give me three gin rickeys and i d speak two hours longer than billy himself could on the silver question finally they persuaded me to take the gold cure if you ve got to get rid of your excess verbiage says i why not go out on the river bank and speak a piece it seems to me there was an old spell binder named cantharides that used to go and disincorporate himself of his windy numbers along the seashore no says andy i must have an audience i feel like if i once turned loose people would begin to call senator beveridge the grand young sphinx of the wabash i ve got to get an audience together jeff and get this oral distension assuaged or it may turn in on me and i d go about feeling like a deckle edge edition de luxe of mrs e d e n southworth on what special subject of the theorems and topics does your desire for vocality seem to be connected with i asks i ain t particular says andy i am equally good and varicose on all subjects i can take up the matter of russian immigration or the poetry of john w keats or the tariff or kabyle literature or drainage and make my audience weep cry sob and shed tears by turns well andy says i if you are bound to get rid of this accumulation of vernacular suppose you go out in town and work it on some indulgent citizen me and the boys will take care of the business everybody will be through dinner pretty soon and salt pork and beans makes a man pretty thirsty we ought to take in more by midnight so andy goes out of the blue snake and i see him stopping men on the street and talking to em by and by he has half a dozen in a bunch listening to him and pretty soon i see him waving his arms and elocuting at a good sized crowd on a corner when he walks away they string out after him talking all the time and he leads em down the main street of bird city with more men joining the procession as they go it reminded me of the old legerdemain that i d read in books about the pied piper of heidsieck charming the children away from the town one o clock came and then two and three got under the wire for place and not a bird citizen came in for a drink the streets were deserted except for some ducks and ladies going to the stores there was only a light drizzle falling then a lonesome man came along and stopped in front of the blue snake to scrape the mud off his boots pardner says i what has happened this morning there was hectic gaiety afoot and now it seems more like one of them ruined cities of tyre and siphon where the lone lizard crawls on the walls of the main port cullis the whole town says the muddy man is up in sperry s wool warehouse listening to your side kicker make a speech he is some gravy on delivering himself of audible sounds relating to matters and conclusions says the man well i hope he ll adjourn sine qua non pretty soon says i for trade languishes not a customer did we have that afternoon at six o clock two mexicans brought andy to the saloon lying across the back of a burro we put him in bed while he still muttered and gesticulated with his hands and feet then i locked up the cash and went out to see what had happened i met a man who told me all about it andy had made the finest two hour speech that had ever been heard in texas he said or anywhere else in the world what was it about i asked temperance says he and when he got through every man in bird city signed the pledge for a year jeff peters as a personal magnet jeff peters has been engaged in as many schemes for making money as there are recipes for cooking rice in charleston s c best of all i like to hear him tell of his earlier days when he sold liniments and cough cures on street corners living hand to mouth heart to heart with the people throwing heads or tails with fortune for his last coin i struck fisher hill arkansaw said he in a buckskin suit moccasins long hair and a thirty carat diamond ring that i got from an actor in texarkana i don t know what he ever did with the pocket knife i swapped him for it i was dr waugh hoo the celebrated indian medicine man i carried only one best bet just then and that was resurrection bitters it was made of life giving plants and herbs accidentally discovered by ta qua la the beautiful wife of the chief of the choctaw nation while gathering truck to garnish a platter of boiled dog for the annual corn dance business hadn t been good in the last town so i only had five dollars i went to the fisher hill druggist and he credited me for half a gross of eight ounce bottles and corks i had the labels and ingredients in my valise left over from the last town life began to look rosy again after i got in my hotel room with the water running from the tap and the resurrection bitters lining up on the table by the dozen fake no sir there was two dollars worth of fluid extract of cinchona and a dime s worth of aniline in that half gross of bitters i ve gone through towns years afterwards and had folks ask for em again i hired a wagon that night and commenced selling the bitters on main street fisher hill was a low malarial town and a compound hypothetical pneumocardiac anti scorbutic tonic was just what i diagnosed the crowd as needing the bitters started off like sweetbreads on toast at a vegetarian dinner i had sold two dozen at fifty cents apiece when i felt somebody pull my coat tail i knew what that meant so i climbed down and sneaked a five dollar bill into the hand of a man with a german silver star on his lapel constable says i it s a fine night have you got a city license he asks to sell this illegitimate essence of spooju that you flatter by the name of medicine i have not says i i didn t know you had a city if i can find it to morrow i ll take one out if it s necessary i ll have to close you up till you do says the constable i quit selling and went back to the hotel i was talking to the landlord about it oh you won t stand no show in fisher hill says he dr hoskins the only doctor here is a brother in law of the mayor and they won t allow no fake doctor to practice in town i don t practice medicine says i i ve got a state peddler s license and i take out a city one wherever they demand it i went to the mayor s office the next morning and they told me he hadn t showed up yet they didn t know when he d be down so doc waugh hoo hunches down again in a hotel chair and lights a jimpson weed regalia and waits by and by a young man in a blue necktie slips into the chair next to me and asks the time half past ten says i and you are andy tucker i ve seen you work wasn t it you that put up the great cupid combination package on the southern states let s see it was a chilian diamond engagement ring a wedding ring a potato masher a bottle of soothing syrup and dorothy vernon all for fifty cents andy was pleased to hear that i remembered him he was a good street man and he was more than that he respected his profession and he was satisfied with per cent profit he had plenty of offers to go into the illegitimate drug and garden seed business but he was never to be tempted off of the straight path i wanted a partner so andy and me agreed to go out together i told him about the situation in fisher hill and how finances was low on account of the local mixture of politics and jalap andy had just got in on the train that morning he was pretty low himself and was going to canvass the whole town for a few dollars to build a new battleship by popular subscription at eureka springs so we went out and sat on the porch and talked it over the next morning at eleven o clock when i was sitting there alone an uncle tom shuffles into the hotel and asked for the doctor to come and see judge banks who it seems was the mayor and a mighty sick man i m no doctor says i why don t you go and get the doctor boss says he doc hoskins am done gone twenty miles in de country to see some sick persons he s de only doctor in de town and massa banks am powerful bad off he sent me to ax you to please suh come as man to man says i i ll go and look him over so i put a bottle of resurrection bitters in my pocket and goes up on the hill to the mayor s mansion the finest house in town with a mansard roof and two cast iron dogs on the lawn this mayor banks was in bed all but his whiskers and feet he was making internal noises that would have had everybody in san francisco hiking for the parks a young man was standing by the bed holding a cup of water doc says the mayor i m awful sick i m about to die can t you do nothing for me mr mayor says i i m not a regular preordained disciple of s q lapius i never took a course in a medical college says i i ve just come as a fellow man to see if i could be off assistance i m deeply obliged says he doc waugh hoo this is my nephew mr biddle he has tried to alleviate my distress but without success oh lordy ow ow ow he sings out i nods at mr biddle and sets down by the bed and feels the mayor s pulse let me see your liver your tongue i mean says i then i turns up the lids of his eyes and looks close that the pupils of em how long have you been sick i asked i was taken down ow ouch last night says the mayor gimme something for it doc won t you mr fiddle says i raise the window shade a bit will you biddle says the young man do you feel like you could eat some ham and eggs uncle james mr mayor says i after laying my ear to his right shoulder blade and listening you ve got a bad attack of super inflammation of the right clavicle of the harpsichord good lord says he with a groan can t you rub something on it or set it or anything i picks up my hat and starts for the door you ain t going doc says the mayor with a howl you ain t going away and leave me to die with this superfluity of the clapboards are you common humanity dr whoa ha says mr biddle ought to prevent your deserting a fellow human in distress dr waugh hoo when you get through plowing says i and then i walks back to the bed and throws back my long hair mr mayor says i there is only one hope for you drugs will do you no good but there is another power higher yet although drugs are high enough says i and what is that says he scientific demonstrations says i the triumph of mind over sarsaparilla the belief that there is no pain and sickness except what is produced when we ain t feeling well declare yourself in arrears demonstrate what is this paraphernalia you speak of doc says the mayor you ain t a socialist are you i am speaking says i of the great doctrine of psychic financiering of the enlightened school of long distance sub conscientious treatment of fallacies and meningitis of that wonderful in door sport known as personal magnetism can you work it doc asks the mayor i m one of the sole sanhedrims and ostensible hooplas of the inner pulpit says i the lame talk and the blind rubber whenever i make a pass at em i am a medium a coloratura hypnotist and a spirituous control it was only through me at the recent seances at ann arbor that the late president of the vinegar bitters company could revisit the earth to communicate with his sister jane you see me peddling medicine on the street says i to the poor i don t practice personal magnetism on them i do not drag it in the dust says i because they haven t got the dust will you treat my case asks the mayor listen says i i ve had a good deal of trouble with medical societies everywhere i ve been i don t practice medicine but to save your life i ll give you the psychic treatment if you ll agree as mayor not to push the license question of course i will says he and now get to work doc for them pains are coming on again my fee will be cure guaranteed in two treatments says i all right says the mayor i ll pay it i guess my life s worth that much i sat down by the bed and looked him straight in the eye now says i get your mind off the disease you ain t sick you haven t got a heart or a clavicle or a funny bone or brains or anything you haven t got any pain declare error now you feel the pain that you didn t have leaving don t you i do feel some little better doc says the mayor darned if i don t now state a few lies about my not having this swelling in my left side and i think i could be propped up and have some sausage and buckwheat cakes i made a few passes with my hands now says i the inflammation s gone the right lobe of the perihelion has subsided you re getting sleepy you can t hold your eyes open any longer for the present the disease is checked now you are asleep the mayor shut his eyes slowly and began to snore you observe mr tiddle says i the wonders of modern science biddle says he when will you give uncle the rest of the treatment dr pooh pooh waugh hoo says i i ll come back at eleven to morrow when he wakes up give him eight drops of turpentine and three pounds of steak good morning the next morning i was back on time well mr riddle says i when he opened the bedroom door and how is uncle this morning he seems much better says the young man the mayor s color and pulse was fine i gave him another treatment and he said the last of the pain left him now says i you d better stay in bed for a day or two and you ll be all right it s a good thing i happened to be in fisher hill mr mayor says i for all the remedies in the cornucopia that the regular schools of medicine use couldn t have saved you and now that error has flew and pain proved a perjurer let s allude to a cheerfuller subject say the fee of no checks please i hate to write my name on the back of a check almost as bad as i do on the front i ve got the cash here says the mayor pulling a pocket book from under his pillow he counts out five fifty dollar notes and holds em in his hand bring the receipt he says to biddle i signed the receipt and the mayor handed me the money i put it in my inside pocket careful now do your duty officer says the mayor grinning much unlike a sick man mr biddle lays his hand on my arm you re under arrest dr waugh hoo alias peters says he for practising medicine without authority under the state law who are you i asks i ll tell you who he is says mr mayor sitting up in bed he s a detective employed by the state medical society he s been following you over five counties he came to me yesterday and we fixed up this scheme to catch you i guess you won t do any more doctoring around these parts mr fakir what was it you said i had doc the mayor laughs compound well it wasn t softening of the brain i guess anyway a detective says i correct says biddle i ll have to turn you over to the sheriff let s see you do it says i and i grabs biddle by the throat and half throws him out the window but he pulls a gun and sticks it under my chin and i stand still then he puts handcuffs on me and takes the money out of my pocket i witness says he that they re the same bank bills that you and i marked judge banks i ll turn them over to the sheriff when we get to his office and he ll send you a receipt they ll have to be used as evidence in the case all right mr biddle says the mayor and now doc waugh hoo he goes on why don t you demonstrate can t you pull the cork out of your magnetism with your teeth and hocus pocus them handcuffs off come on officer says i dignified i may as well make the best of it and then i turns to old banks and rattles my chains mr mayor says i the time will come soon when you ll believe that personal magnetism is a success and you ll be sure that it succeeded in this case too and i guess it did when we got nearly to the gate i says we might meet somebody now andy i reckon you better take em off and hey why of course it was andy tucker that was his scheme and that s how we got the capital to go into business together modern rural sports jeff peters must be reminded whenever he is called upon pointedly for a story he will maintain that his life has been as devoid of incident as the longest of trollope s novels but lured he will divulge therefore i cast many and divers flies upon the current of his thoughts before i feel a nibble i notice said i that the western farmers in spite of their prosperity are running after their old populistic idols again it s the running season said jeff for farmers shad maple trees and the connemaugh river i know something about farmers i thought i struck one once that had got out of the rut but andy tucker proved to me i was mistaken once a farmer always a sucker said andy he s the man that s shoved into the front row among bullets ballots and the ballet he s the funny bone and gristle of the country said andy and i don t know who we would do without him one morning me and andy wakes up with sixty eight cents between us in a yellow pine hotel on the edge of the pre digested hoe cake belt of southern indiana how we got off the train there the night before i can t tell you for she went through the village so fast that what looked like a saloon to us through the car window turned out to be a composite view of a drug store and a water tank two blocks apart why we got off at the first station we could belongs to a little oroide gold watch and alaska diamond deal we failed to pull off the day before over the kentucky line when i woke up i heard roosters crowing and smelt something like the fumes of nitro muriatic acid and heard something heavy fall on the floor below us and a man swearing cheer up andy says i we re in a rural community somebody has just tested a gold brick downstairs we ll go out and get what s coming to us from a farmer and then yoicks and away farmers was always a kind of reserve fund to me whenever i was in hard luck i d go to the crossroads hook a finger in a farmer s suspender recite the prospectus of my swindle in a mechanical kind of a way look over what he had give him back his keys whetstone and papers that was of no value except to owner and stroll away without asking any questions farmers are not fair game to me as high up in our business as me and andy was but there was times when we found em useful just as wall street does the secretary of the treasury now and then when we went down stairs we saw we was in the midst of the finest farming section we ever see about two miles away on a hill was a big white house in a grove surrounded by a wide spread agricultural agglomeration of fields and barns and pastures and out houses whose house is that we asked the landlord that says he is the domicile and the arboreal terrestrial and horticultural accessories of farmer ezra plunkett one of our county s most progressive citizens after breakfast me and andy with eight cents capital left casts the horoscope of the rural potentate let me go alone says i two of us against one farmer would look as one sided as roosevelt using both hands to kill a grizzly all right says andy i like to be a true sport even when i m only collecting rebates from the rutabag raisers what bait are you going to use for this ezra thing andy asks me oh i says the first thing that come to hand in the suit case i reckon i ll take along some of the new income tax receipts and the recipe for making clover honey out of clabber and apple peelings and the order blanks for the mcguffey s readers which afterwards turn out to be mccormick s reapers and the pearl necklace found on the train and a pocket size goldbrick and a that ll be enough says andy any one of the lot ought to land on ezra and say jeff make that succotash fancier give you nice clean new bills it s a disgrace to our department of agriculture civil service and pure food law the kind of stuff some of these farmers hand out to use i ve had to take rolls from em that looked like bundles of microbe cultures captured out of a red cross ambulance so i goes to a livery stable and hires a buggy on my looks i drove out to the plunkett farm and hitched there was a man sitting on the front steps of the house he had on a white flannel suit a diamond ring golf cap and a pink ascot tie summer boarder says i to myself i d like to see farmer ezra plunkett says i to him you see him says he what seems to be on your mind i never answered a word i stood still repeating to myself the rollicking lines of that merry jingle the man with the hoe when i looked at this farmer the little devices i had in my pocket for buncoing the pushed back brows seemed as hopeless as trying to shake down the beef trust with a mittimus and a parlor rifle well says he looking at me close speak up i see the left pocket of your coat sags a good deal out with the goldbrick first i m rather more interested in the bricks than i am in the trick sixty day notes and the lost silver mine story i had a kind of cerebral sensation of foolishness in my ideas of ratiocination but i pulled out the little brick and unwrapped my handkerchief off it one dollar and eighty cents says the farmer hefting it in his hand is it a trade the lead in it is worth more than that says i dignified i put it back in my pocket all right says he but i sort of wanted it for the collection i m starting i got a one last week for just then a telephone bell rings in the house come in bunk says the farmer and look at my place it s kind of lonesome here sometimes i think that s new york calling we went inside the room looked like a broadway stockbroker s light oak desks two phones spanish leather upholstered chairs and couches oil paintings in gilt frames a foot deep and a ticker hitting off the news in one corner hello hello says this funny farmer is that the regent theatre yes this is plunkett of woodbine centre reserve four orchestra seats for friday evening my usual ones yes friday good bye i run over to new york every two weeks to see a show says the farmer hanging up the receiver i catch the eighteen hour flyer at indianapolis spend ten hours in the heyday of night on the yappian way and get home in time to see the chickens go to roost forty eight hours later oh the pristine hubbard squasherino of the cave dwelling period is getting geared up some for the annual meeting of the don t blow out the gas association don t you think mr bunk i seem to perceive says i a kind of hiatus in the agrarian traditions in which heretofore i have reposed confidence sure bunk says he the yellow primrose on the river s brim is getting to look to us reubs like a holiday edition de luxe of the language of flowers with deckle edges and frontispiece just then the telephone calls him again hello hello says he oh that s perkins at milldale i told you was too much for that horse have you got him there good let me see him get away from the transmitter now make him trot in a circle faster yes i can hear him keep on faster yet that ll do now lead him up to the phone closer get his nose nearer there now wait no i don t want that horse what no not at any price he interferes and he s windbroken goodbye now bunk says the farmer do you begin to realize that agriculture has had a hair cut you belong in a bygone era why tom lawson himself knows better than to try to catch an up to date agriculturalist napping it s saturday the fourteenth on the farm you bet now look here and see how we keep up with the day s doings he shows me a machine on a table with two things for your ears like the penny in the slot affairs i puts it on and listens a female voice starts up reading headlines of murders accidents and other political casualities what you hear says the farmer is a synopsis of to day s news in the new york chicago st louis and san francisco papers it is wired in to our rural news bureau and served hot to subscribers on this table you see the principal dailies and weeklies of the country also a special service of advance sheets of the monthly magazines i picks up one sheet and sees that it s headed special advance proofs in july the century will say and so forth the farmer rings up somebody his manager i reckon and tells him to let that herd of jerseys go at a head and to sow the acre field in wheat and to have extra cans ready at the station for the milk trolley car then he passes the henry clays and sets out a bottle of green chartreuse and goes over and looks at the ticker tape consolidated gas up two points says he oh very well ever monkey with copper i asks stand back says he raising his hand or i ll call the dog i told you not to waste your time after a while he says bunk if you don t mind my telling you your company begins to cloy slightly i ve got to write an article on the chimera of communism for a magazine and attend a meeting of the race track association this afternoon of course you understand by now that you can t get my proxy for your remedy whatever it may be well sir all i could think of to do was to go out and get in the buggy the horse turned round and took me back to the hotel i hitched him and went in to see andy in his room i told him about this farmer word for word and i sat picking at the table cover like one bereft of sagaciousness i don t understand it says i humming a sad and foolish little song to cover my humiliation andy walks up and down the room for a long time biting the left end of his mustache as he does when in the act of thinking jeff says he finally i believe your story of this expurgated rustic but i am not convinced it looks incredulous to me that he could have inoculated himself against all the preordained systems of bucolic bunco now you never regarded me as a man of special religious proclivities did you jeff says andy well says i no but says i not to wound his feelings i have also observed many church members whose said proclivities were not so outwardly developed that they would show on a white handkerchief if you rubbed em with it i have always been a deep student of nature from creation down says andy and i believe in an ultimatum design of providence farmers was made for a purpose and that was to furnish a livelihood to men like me and you else why was we given brains it is my belief that the manna that the israelites lived on for forty years in the wilderness was only a figurative word for farmers and they kept up the practice to this day and now says andy i am going to test my theory once a farmer always a come on in spite of the veneering and the orifices that a spurious civilization has brought to him you ll fail same as i did says i this one s shook off the shackles of the sheep fold he s entrenched behind the advantages of electricity education literature and intelligence i ll try said andy there are certain laws of nature that free rural delivery can t overcome andy fumbles around awhile in the closet and comes out dressed in a suit with brown and yellow checks as big as your hand his vest is red with blue dots and he wears a high silk hat i noticed he d soaked his sandy mustache in a kind of blue ink great barnums says i you re a ringer for a circus thimblerig man right says andy is the buggy outside wait here till i come back i won t be long two hours afterwards andy steps into the room and lays a wad of money on the table eight hundred and sixty dollars said he let me tell you he was in he looked me over and began to guy me i didn t say a word but got out the walnut shells and began to roll the little ball on the table i whistled a tune or two and then i started up the old formula step up lively gentlemen says i and watch the little ball it costs you nothing to look there you see it and there you don t guess where the little joker is the quickness of the hand deceives the eye i steals a look at the farmer man i see the sweat coming out on his forehead he goes over and closes the front door and watches me some more directly he says i ll bet you twenty i can pick the shell the ball s under now after that goes on andy there is nothing new to relate he only had cash in the house when i left he followed me to the gate there was tears in his eyes when he shook hands bunk says he thank you for the only real pleasure i ve had in years it brings up happy old days when i was only a farmer and not an agriculturalist god bless you here jeff peters ceased and i inferred that his story was done then you think i began yes said jeff something like that you let the farmers go ahead and amuse themselves with politics farming s a lonesome life and they ve been against the shell game before the chair of philanthromathematics i see that the cause of education has received the princely gift of more than fifty millions of dollars said i i was gleaning the stray items from the evening papers while jeff peters packed his briar pipe with plug cut which same said jeff calls for a new deck and a recitation by the entire class in philanthromathematics is that an allusion i asked it is said jeff i never told you about the time when me and andy tucker was philanthropists did i it was eight years ago in arizona andy and me was out in the gila mountains with a two horse wagon prospecting for silver we struck it and sold out to parties in tucson for they paid our check at the bank in silver a thousand dollars in a sack we loaded it in our wagon and drove east a hundred miles before we recovered our presence of intellect twenty five thousand dollars doesn t sound like so much when you re reading the annual report of the pennsylvania railroad or listening to an actor talking about his salary but when you can raise up a wagon sheet and kick around your bootheel and hear every one of em ring against another it makes you feel like you was a night and day bank with the clock striking twelve the third day out we drove into one of the most specious and tidy little towns that nature or rand and mcnally ever turned out it was in the foothills and mitigated with trees and flowers and about head of cordial and dilatory inhabitants the town seemed to be called floresville and nature had not contaminated it with many railroads fleas or eastern tourists me and andy deposited our money to the credit of peters and tucker in the esperanza savings bank and got rooms at the skyview hotel after supper we lit up and sat out on the gallery and smoked then was when the philanthropy idea struck me i suppose every grafter gets it sometime when a man swindles the public out of a certain amount he begins to get scared and wants to return part of it and if you ll watch close and notice the way his charity runs you ll see that he tries to restore it to the same people he got it from as a hydrostatical case take let s say a a made his millions selling oil to poor students who sit up nights studying political economy and methods for regulating the trusts so back to the universities and colleges goes his conscience dollars there s b got his from the common laboring man that works with his hands and tools how s he to get some of the remorse fund back into their overalls aha says b i ll do it in the name of education i ve skinned the laboring man says he to himself but according to the old proverb charity covers a multitude of skins so he puts up eighty million dollars worth of libraries and the boys with the dinner pail that builds em gets the benefit where s the books asks the reading public i dinna ken says b i offered ye libraries and there they are i suppose if i d given ye preferred steel trust stock instead ye d have wanted the water in it set out in cut glass decanters hoot for ye but as i said the owning of so much money was beginning to give me philanthropitis it was the first time me and andy had ever made a pile big enough to make us stop and think how we got it andy says i we re wealthy not beyond the dreams of average but in our humble way we are comparatively as rich as greasers i feel as if i d like to do something for as well as to humanity i was thinking the same thing jeff says he we ve been gouging the public for a long time with all kinds of little schemes from selling self igniting celluloid collars to flooding georgia with hoke smith presidential campaign buttons i d like myself to hedge a bet or two in the graft game if i could do it without actually banging the cymbalines in the salvation army or teaching a bible class by the bertillon system what ll we do says andy give free grub to the poor or send a couple of thousand to george cortelyou neither says i we ve got too much money to be implicated in plain charity and we haven t got enough to make restitution so we ll look about for something that s about half way between the two the next day in walking around floresville we see on a hill a big red brick building that appears to be disinhabited the citizens speak up and tell us that it was begun for a residence several years before by a mine owner after running up the house he finds he only had left to furnish it with so he invests that in whiskey and jumps off the roof on a spot where he now requiescats in pieces as soon as me and andy saw that building the same idea struck both of us we would fix it up with lights and pen wipers and professors and put an iron dog and statues of hercules and father john on the lawn and start one of the finest free educational institutions in the world right there so we talks it over to the prominent citizens of floresville who falls in fine with the idea they give a banquet in the engine house to us and we make our bow for the first time as benefactors to the cause of progress and enlightenment andy makes an hour and a half speech on the subject of irrigation in lower egypt and we have a moral tune on the phonograph and pineapple sherbet andy and me didn t lose any time in philanthropping we put every man in town that could tell a hammer from a step ladder to work on the building dividing it up into class rooms and lecture halls we wire to frisco for a car load of desks footballs arithmetics penholders dictionaries chairs for the professors slates skeletons sponges twenty seven cravenetted gowns and caps for the senior class and an open order for all the truck that goes with a first class university i took it on myself to put a campus and a curriculum on the list but the telegraph operator must have got the words wrong being an ignorant man for when the goods come we found a can of peas and a curry comb among em while the weekly papers was having chalk plate cuts of me and andy we wired an employment agency in chicago to express us f o b six professors immediately one english literature one up to date dead languages one chemistry one political economy democrat preferred one logic and one wise to painting italian and music with union card the esperanza bank guaranteed salaries which was to run between and well sir we finally got in shape over the front door was carved the words the world s university peters tucker patrons and proprietors and when september the first got a cross mark on the calendar the come ons begun to roll in first the faculty got off the tri weekly express from tucson they was mostly young spectacled and red headed with sentiments divided between ambition and food andy and me got em billeted on the floresvillians and then laid for the students they came in bunches we had advertised the university in all the state papers and it did us good to see how quick the country responded two hundred and nineteen husky lads aging along from up to chin whiskers answered the clarion call of free education they ripped open that town sponged the seams turned it lined it with new mohair and you couldn t have told it from harvard or goldfields at the march term of court they marched up and down the streets waving flags with the world s university colors ultra marine and blue and they certainly made a lively place of floresville andy made them a speech from the balcony of the skyview hotel and the whole town was out celebrating in about two weeks the professors got the students disarmed and herded into classes i don t believe there s any pleasure equal to being a philanthropist me and andy bought high silk hats and pretended to dodge the two reporters of the floresville gazette the paper had a man to kodak us whenever we appeared on the street and ran our pictures every week over the column headed educational notes andy lectured twice a week at the university and afterward i would rise and tell a humorous story once the gazette printed my pictures with abe lincoln on one side and marshall p wilder on the other andy was as interested in philanthropy as i was we used to wake up of nights and tell each other new ideas for booming the university andy says i to him one day there s something we overlooked the boys ought to have dromedaries what s that andy asks why something to sleep in of course says i all colleges have em oh you mean pajamas says andy i do not says i i mean dromedaries but i never could make andy understand so we never ordered em of course i meant them long bedrooms in colleges where the scholars sleep in a row well sir the world s university was a success we had scholars from five states and territories and floresville had a boom a new shooting gallery and a pawn shop and two more saloons started and the boys got up a college yell that went this way raw raw raw done done done peters tucker lots of fun bow wow wow haw hee haw world university hip hurrah the scholars was a fine lot of young men and me and andy was as proud of em as if they belonged to our own family but one day about the last of october andy comes to me and asks if i have any idea how much money we had left in the bank i guesses about sixteen thousand our balance says andy is what says i with a kind of a yell do you mean to tell me that them infernal clod hopping dough headed pup faced goose brained gate stealing rabbit eared sons of horse thieves have soaked us for that much no less says andy then to helvetia with philanthropy says i not necessarily says andy philanthropy says he when run on a good business basis is one of the best grafts going i ll look into the matter and see if it can t be straightened out the next week i am looking over the payroll of our faculty when i run across a new name professor james darnley mccorkle chair of mathematics salary per week i yells so loud that andy runs in quick what s this says i a professor of mathematics at more than a year how did this happen did he get in through the window and appoint himself i wired to frisco for him a week ago says andy in ordering the faculty we seemed to have overlooked the chair of mathematics a good thing we did says i we can pay his salary two weeks and then our philanthropy will look like the ninth hole on the skibo golf links wait a while says andy and see how things turn out we have taken up too noble a cause to draw out now besides the further i gaze into the retail philanthropy business the better it looks to me i never thought about investigating it before come to think of it now goes on andy all the philanthropists i ever knew had plenty of money i ought to have looked into that matter long ago and located which was the cause and which was the effect i had confidence in andy s chicanery in financial affairs so i left the whole thing in his hands the university was flourishing fine and me and andy kept our silk hats shined up and floresville kept on heaping honors on us like we was millionaires instead of almost busted philanthropists the students kept the town lively and prosperous some stranger came to town and started a faro bank over the red front livery stable and began to amass money in quantities me and andy strolled up one night and piked a dollar or two for sociability there were about fifty of our students there drinking rum punches and shoving high stacks of blues and reds about the table as the dealer turned the cards up why dang it andy says i these free school hunting gander headed silk socked little sons of sap suckers have got more money than you and me ever had look at the rolls they re pulling out of their pistol pockets yes says andy a good many of them are sons of wealthy miners and stockmen it s very sad to see em wasting their opportunities this way at christmas all the students went home to spend the holidays we had a farewell blowout at the university and andy lectured on modern music and prehistoric literature of the archipelagos each one of the faculty answered to toasts and compared me and andy to rockefeller and the emperor marcus autolycus i pounded on the table and yelled for professor mccorkle but it seems he wasn t present on the occasion i wanted a look at the man that andy thought could earn a week in philanthropy that was on the point of making an assignment the students all left on the night train and the town sounded as quiet as the campus of a correspondence school at midnight when i went to the hotel i saw a light in andy s room and i opened the door and walked in there sat andy and the faro dealer at a table dividing a two foot high stack of currency in thousand dollar packages correct says andy thirty one thousand apiece come in jeff says he this is our share of the profits of the first half of the scholastic term of the world s university incorporated and philanthropated are you convinced now says andy that philanthropy when practiced in a business way is an art that blesses him who gives as well as him who receives great says i feeling fine i ll admit you are the doctor this time we ll be leaving on the morning train says andy you d better get your collars and cuffs and press clippings together great says i i ll be ready but andy says i i wish i could have met that professor james darnley mccorkle before we went i had a curiosity to know that man that ll be easy says andy turning around to the faro dealer jim says andy shake hands with mr peters the hand that riles the world many of our great men said i apropos of many things have declared that they owe their success to the aid and encouragement of some brilliant woman i know said jeff peters i ve read in history and mythology about joan of arc and mme yale and mrs caudle and eve and other noted females of the past but in my opinion the woman of to day is of little use in politics or business what s she best in anyway men make the best cooks milliners nurses housekeepers stenographers clerks hairdressers and launderers about the only job left that a woman can beat a man in is female impersonator in vaudeville i would have thought said i that occasionally anyhow you would have found the wit and intuition of woman valuable to you in your lines of er business now wouldn t you said jeff with an emphatic nod wouldn t you have imagined that but a woman is an absolutely unreliable partner in any straight swindle she s liable to turn honest on you when you are depending upon her the most i tried em once bill humble an old friend of mine in the territories conceived the illusion that he wanted to be appointed united states marshall at that time me and andy was doing a square legitimate business of selling walking canes if you unscrewed the head of one and turned it up to your mouth a half pint of good rye whiskey would go trickling down your throat to reward you for your act of intelligence the deputies was annoying me and andy some and when bill spoke to me about his officious aspirations i saw how the appointment as marshall might help along the firm of peters tucker jeff says bill to me you are a man of learning and education besides having knowledge and information concerning not only rudiments but facts and attainments i do says i and i have never regretted it i am not one says i who would cheapen education by making it free tell me says i which is of the most value to mankind literature or horse racing why er playing the po i mean of course the poets and the great writers have got the call of course says bill exactly says i then why do the master minds of finance and philanthropy says i charge us to get into a race track and let us into a library free is that distilling into the masses says i a correct estimate of the relative value of the two means of self culture and disorder you are arguing outside of my faculties of sense and rhetoric says bill what i wanted you to do is to go to washington and dig out this appointment for me i haven t no ideas of cultivation and intrigue i m a plain citizen and i need the job i ve killed seven men says bill i ve got nine children i ve been a good republican ever since the first of may i can t read nor write and i see no reason why i ain t illegible for the office and i think your partner mr tucker goes on bill is also a man of sufficient ingratiation and connected system of mental delinquency to assist you in securing the appointment i will give you preliminary says bill for drinks bribes and carfare in washington if you land the job i will pay you more cash down and guarantee you impunity in boot legging whiskey for twelve months are you patriotic to the west enough to help me put this thing through the whitewashed wigwam of the great father of the most eastern flag station of the pennsylvania railroad says bill well i talked to andy about it and he liked the idea immense andy was a man of an involved nature he was never content to plod along as i was selling to the peasantry some little tool like a combination steak beater shoe horn marcel waver monkey wrench nail file potato masher and multum in parvo tuning fork andy had the artistic temper which is not to be judged as a preacher s or a moral man s is by purely commercial deflections so we accepted bill s offer and strikes out for washington says i to andy when we get located at a hotel on south dakota avenue g s s w now andy for the first time in our lives we ve got to do a real dishonest act lobbying is something we ve never been used to but we ve got to scandalize ourselves for bill humble s sake in a straight and legitimate business says i we could afford to introduce a little foul play and chicanery but in a disorderly and heinous piece of malpractice like this it seems to me that the straightforward and aboveboard way is the best i propose says i that we hand over of this money to the chairman of the national campaign committee get a receipt lay the receipt on the president s desk and tell him about bill the president is a man who would appreciate a candidate who went about getting office that way instead of pulling wires andy agreed with me but after we talked the scheme over with the hotel clerk we give that plan up he told us that there was only one way to get an appointment in washington and that was through a lady lobbyist he gave us the address of one he recommended a mrs avery who he said was high up in sociable and diplomatic rings and circles the next morning at o clock me and andy called at her hotel and was shown up to her reception room this mrs avery was a solace and a balm to the eyesight she had hair the color of the back of a twenty dollar gold certificate blue eyes and a system of beauty that would make the girl on the cover of a july magazine look like a cook on a monongahela coal barge she had on a low necked dress covered with silver spangles and diamond rings and ear bobs her arms was bare and she was using a desk telephone with one hand and drinking tea with the other well boys says she after a bit what is it i told her in as few words as possible what we wanted for bill and the price we could pay those western appointments says she are easy le me see now says she who could put that through for us no use fooling with the territorial delegates i guess says she that senator sniper would be about the man he s from somewheres in the west let s see how he stands on my private menu card she takes some papers out of a pigeon hole with the letter s over it yes says she he s marked with a star that means ready to serve now let s see age married twice presbyterian likes blondes tolstoi poker and stewed terrapin sentimental at third bottle of wine yes she goes on i am sure i can have your friend mr bummer appointed minister to brazil humble says i and united states marshal was the berth oh yes says mrs avery i have so many deals of this sort i sometimes get them confused give me all the memoranda you have of the case mr peters and come back in four days i think it can be arranged by then so me and andy goes back to our hotel and waits andy walks up and down and chews the left end of his mustache a woman of high intellect and perfect beauty is a rare thing jeff says he as rare says i as an omelet made from the eggs of the fabulous bird known as the epidermis says i a woman like that says andy ought to lead a man to the highest positions of opulence and fame i misdoubt says i if any woman ever helped a man to secure a job any more than to have his meals ready promptly and spread a report that the other candidate s wife had once been a shoplifter they are no more adapted for business and politics says i than algernon charles swinburne is to be floor manager at one of chuck connor s annual balls i know says i to andy that sometimes a woman seems to step out into the kalsomine light as the charge d affaires of her man s political job but how does it come out say they have a neat little berth somewhere as foreign consul of record to afghanistan or lockkeeper on the delaware and raritan canal one day this man finds his wife putting on her overshoes and three months supply of bird seed into the canary s cage sioux falls he asks with a kind of hopeful light in his eye no arthur says she washington we re wasted here says she you ought to be toady extraordinary to the court of st bridget or head porter of the island of porto rico i m going to see about it then this lady i says to andy moves against the authorities at washington with her baggage and munitions consisting of five dozen indiscriminating letters written to her by a member of the cabinet when she was a letter of introduction from king leopold to the smithsonian institution and a pink silk costume with canary colored spats well and then what i goes she has the letters printed in the evening papers that match her costume she lectures at an informal tea given in the palm room of the b o depot and then calls on the president the ninth assistant secretary of commerce and labor the first aide de camp of the blue room and an unidentified colored man are waiting there to grasp her by the hands and feet they carry her out to s w b street and leave her on a cellar door that ends it the next time we hear of her she is writing postcards to the chinese minister asking him to get arthur a job in a tea store then says andy you don t think mrs avery will land the marshalship for bill i do not says i i do not wish to be a septic but i doubt if she can do as well as you and me could have done i don t agree with you says andy i ll bet you she does i m proud of having a higher opinion of the talent and the powers of negotiation of ladies we was back at mrs avery s hotel at the time she appointed she was looking pretty and fine enough as far as that went to make any man let her name every officer in the country but i hadn t much faith in looks so i was certainly surprised when she pulls out a document with the great seal of the united states on it and william henry humble in a fine big hand on the back you might have had it the next day boys says mrs avery smiling i hadn t the slightest trouble in getting it says she i just asked for it that s all now i d like to talk to you a while she goes on but i m awfully busy and i know you ll excuse me i ve got an ambassadorship two consulates and a dozen other minor applications to look after i can hardly find time to sleep at all you ll give my compliments to mr humble when you get home of course well i handed her the which she pitched into her desk drawer without counting i put bill s appointment in my pocket and me and andy made our adieus we started back for the territory the same day we wired bill job landed get the tall glasses ready and we felt pretty good andy joshed me all the way about how little i knew about women all right says i i ll admit that she surprised me but it s the first time i ever knew one of em to manipulate a piece of business on time without getting it bungled up in some way says i down about the edge of arkansas i got out bill s appointment and looked it over and then i handed it to andy to read andy read it but didn t add any remarks to my silence the paper was for bill all right and a genuine document but it appointed him postmaster of dade city fla me and andy got off the train at little rock and sent bill s appointment to him by mail then we struck northeast toward lake superior i never saw bill humble after that the exact science of matrimony as i have told you before said jeff peters i never had much confidence in the perfidiousness of woman as partners or coeducators in the most innocent line of graft they are not trustworthy they deserve the compliment said i i think they are entitled to be called the honest sex why shouldn t they be said jeff they ve got the other sex either grafting or working overtime for em they re all right in business until they get their emotions or their hair touched up too much then you want to have a flat footed heavy breathing man with sandy whiskers five kids and a building and loan mortgage ready as an understudy to take her desk now there was that widow lady that me and andy tucker engaged to help us in that little matrimonial agency scheme we floated out in cairo when you ve got enough advertising capital say a roll as big as the little end of a wagon tongue there s money in matrimonial agencies we had about and we expected to double it in two months which is about as long as a scheme like ours can be carried on without taking out a new jersey charter we fixed up an advertisement that read about like this charming widow beautiful home loving years possessing cash and owning valuable country property would remarry would prefer a poor man with affectionate disposition to one with means as she realizes that the solid virtues are oftenest to be found in the humble walks of life no objection to elderly man or one of homely appearance if faithful and true and competent to manage property and invest money with judgment address with particulars lonely care of peters tucker agents cairo ill so far so pernicious says i when we had finished the literary concoction and now says i where is the lady andy gives me one of his looks of calm irritation jeff says he i thought you had lost them ideas of realism in your art why should there be a lady when they sell a lot of watered stock on wall street would you expect to find a mermaid in it what has a matrimonial ad got to do with a lady now listen says i you know my rule andy that in all my illegitimate inroads against the legal letter of the law the article sold must be existent visible producible in that way and by a careful study of city ordinances and train schedules i have kept out of all trouble with the police that a five dollar bill and a cigar could not square now to work this scheme we ve got to be able to produce bodily a charming widow or its equivalent with or without the beauty hereditaments and appurtenances set forth in the catalogue and writ of errors or hereafter be held by a justice of the peace well says andy reconstructing his mind maybe it would be safer in case the post office or the peace commission should try to investigate our agency but where he says could you hope to find a widow who would waste time on a matrimonial scheme that had no matrimony in it i told andy that i thought i knew of the exact party an old friend of mine zeke trotter who used to draw soda water and teeth in a tent show had made his wife a widow a year before by drinking some dyspepsia cure of the old doctor s instead of the liniment that he always got boozed up on i used to stop at their house often and i thought we could get her to work with us twas only sixty miles to the little town where she lived so i jumped out on the i c and finds her in the same cottage with the same sunflowers and roosters standing on the washtub mrs trotter fitted our ad first rate except maybe for beauty and age and property valuation but she looked feasible and praiseworthy to the eye and it was a kindness to zeke s memory to give her the job is this an honest deal you are putting on mr peters she asks me when i tell her what we want mrs trotter says i andy tucker and me have computed the calculation that men in this broad and unfair country will endeavor to secure your fair hand and ostensible money and property through our advertisement out of that number something like thirty hundred will expect to give you in exchange if they should win you the carcass of a lazy and mercenary loafer a failure in life a swindler and contemptible fortune seeker me and andy says i propose to teach these preyers upon society a lesson it was with difficulty says i that me and andy could refrain from forming a corporation under the title of the great moral and millennial malevolent matrimonial agency does that satisfy you it does mr peters says she i might have known you wouldn t have gone into anything that wasn t opprobrious but what will my duties be do i have to reject personally these ramscallions you speak of or can i throw them out in bunches your job mrs trotter says i will be practically a cynosure you will live at a quiet hotel and will have no work to do andy and i will attend to all the correspondence and business end of it of course says i some of the more ardent and impetuous suitors who can raise the railroad fare may come to cairo to personally press their suit or whatever fraction of a suit they may be wearing in that case you will be probably put to the inconvenience of kicking them out face to face we will pay you per week and hotel expenses give me five minutes says mrs trotter to get my powder rag and leave the front door key with a neighbor and you can let my salary begin so i conveys mrs trotter to cairo and establishes her in a family hotel far enough away from mine and andy s quarters to be unsuspicious and available and i tell andy great says andy and now that your conscience is appeased as to the tangibility and proximity of the bait and leaving mutton aside suppose we revenoo a noo fish so we began to insert our advertisement in newspapers covering the country far and wide one ad was all we used we couldn t have used more without hiring so many clerks and marcelled paraphernalia that the sound of the gum chewing would have disturbed the postmaster general we placed in a bank to mrs trotter s credit and gave her the book to show in case anybody might question the honesty and good faith of the agency i knew mrs trotter was square and reliable and it was safe to leave it in her name with that one ad andy and me put in twelve hours a day answering letters about one hundred a day was what came in i never knew there was so many large hearted but indigent men in the country who were willing to acquire a charming widow and assume the burden of investing her money most of them admitted that they ran principally to whiskers and lost jobs and were misunderstood by the world but all of em were sure that they were so chock full of affection and manly qualities that the widow would be making the bargain of her life to get em every applicant got a reply from peters tucker informing him that the widow had been deeply impressed by his straightforward and interesting letter and requesting them to write again stating more particulars and enclosing photograph if convenient peters tucker also informed the applicant that their fee for handing over the second letter to their fair client would be enclosed therewith there you see the simple beauty of the scheme about per cent of them domestic foreign noblemen raised the price somehow and sent it in that was all there was to it except that me and andy complained an amount about being put to the trouble of slicing open them envelopes and taking the money out some few clients called in person we sent em to mrs trotter and she did the rest except for three or four who came back to strike us for carfare after the letters began to get in from the r f d districts andy and me were taking in about a day one afternoon when we were busiest and i was stuffing the two and ones into cigar boxes and andy was whistling no wedding bells for her a small slick man drops in and runs his eye over the walls like he was on the trail of a lost gainesborough painting or two as soon as i saw him i felt a glow of pride because we were running our business on the level i see you have quite a large mail to day says the man i reached and got my hat come on says i we ve been expecting you i ll show you the goods how was teddy when you left washington i took him down to the riverview hotel and had him shake hands with mrs trotter then i showed him her bank book with the to her credit it seems to be all right says the secret service it is says i and if you re not a married man i ll leave you to talk a while with the lady we won t mention the two dollars thanks says he if i wasn t i might good day mrs peters toward the end of three months we had taken in something over and we saw it was time to quit we had a good many complaints made to us and mrs trotter seemed to be tired of the job a good many suitors had been calling to see her and she didn t seem to like that so we decides to pull out and i goes down to mrs trotter s hotel to pay her last week s salary and say farewell and get her check for the when i got there i found her crying like a kid that don t want to go to school now now says i what s it all about somebody sassed you or you getting homesick no mr peters says she i ll tell you you was always a friend of zeke s and i don t mind mr peters i m in love i just love a man so hard i can t bear not to get him he s just the ideal i ve always had in mind then take him says i that is if it s a mutual case does he return the sentiment according to the specifications and painfulness you have described he does says she but he s one of the gentlemen that s been coming to see me about the advertisement and he won t marry me unless i give him the his name is william wilkinson and then she goes off again in the agitations and hysterics of romance mrs trotter says i there s no man more sympathizing with a woman s affections than i am besides you was once the life partner of one of my best friends if it was left to me i d say take this and the man of your choice and be happy we could afford to do that because we have cleaned up over from these suckers that wanted to marry you but says i andy tucker is to be consulted he is a good man but keen in business he is my equal partner financially i will talk to andy says i and see what can be done i goes back to our hotel and lays the case before andy i was expecting something like this all the time says andy you can t trust a woman to stick by you in any scheme that involves her emotions and preferences it s a sad thing andy says i to think that we ve been the cause of the breaking of a woman s heart it is says andy and i tell you what i m willing to do jeff you ve always been a man of a soft and generous heart and disposition perhaps i ve been too hard and worldly and suspicious for once i ll meet you half way go to mrs trotter and tell her to draw the from the bank and give it to this man she s infatuated with and be happy i jumps up and shakes andy s hand for five minutes and then i goes back to mrs trotter and tells her and she cries as hard for joy as she did for sorrow two days afterward me and andy packed up to go wouldn t you like to go down and meet mrs trotter once before we leave i asks him she d like mightily to know you and express her encomiums and gratitude why i guess not says andy i guess we d better hurry and catch that train i was strapping our capital around me in a memory belt like we always carried it when andy pulls a roll of large bills out of his pocket and asks me to put em with the rest what s this says i it s mrs trotter s two thousand says andy how do you come to have it i asks she gave it to me says andy i ve been calling on her three evenings a week for more than a month then are you william wilkinson says i i was says andy a midsummer masquerade satan said jeff peters is a hard boss to work for when other people are having their vacation is when he keeps you the busiest as old dr watts or st paul or some other diagnostician says he always finds somebody for idle hands to do i remember one summer when me and my partner andy tucker tried to take a layoff from our professional and business duties but it seems that our work followed us wherever we went now with a preacher it s different he can throw off his responsibilities and enjoy himself on the st of may he wraps mosquito netting and tin foil around the pulpit grabs his niblick breviary and fishing pole and hikes for lake como or atlantic city according to the size of the loudness with which he has been called by his congregation and sir for three months he don t have to think about business except to hunt around in deuteronomy and proverbs and timothy to find texts to cover and exculpate such little midsummer penances as dropping a couple of looey door on rouge or teaching a presbyterian widow to swim but i was going to tell you about mine and andy s summer vacation that wasn t one we was tired of finance and all the branches of unsanctified ingenuity even andy whose brain rarely ever stopped working began to make noises like a tennis cabinet heigh ho says andy i m tired i ve got that steam up the yacht corsair and ho for the riviera feeling i want to loaf and indict my soul as walt whittier says i want to play pinochle with merry del val or give a knouting to the tenants on my tarrytown estates or do a monologue at a chautauqua picnic in kilts or something summery and outside the line of routine and sand bagging patience says i you ll have to climb higher in the profession before you can taste the laurels that crown the footprints of the great captains of industry now what i d like andy says i would be a summer sojourn in a mountain village far from scenes of larceny labor and overcapitalization i m tired too and a month or so of sinlessness ought to leave us in good shape to begin again to take away the white man s burdens in the fall andy fell in with the rest cure at once so we struck the general passenger agents of all the railroads for summer resort literature and took a week to study out where we should go i reckon the first passenger agent in the world was that man genesis but there wasn t much competition in his day and when he said the lord made the earth in six days and all very good he hadn t any idea to what extent the press agents of the summer hotels would plagiarize from him later on when we finished the booklets we perceived easy that the united states from passadumkeg maine to el paso and from skagway to key west was a paradise of glorious mountain peaks crystal lakes new laid eggs golf girls garages cooling breezes straw rides open plumbing and tennis and all within two hours ride so me and andy dumps the books out the back window and packs our trunk and takes the o clock tortoise flyer for crow knob a kind of a dernier resort in the mountains on the line of tennessee and north carolina we was directed to a kind of private hotel called woodchuck inn and thither me and andy bent and almost broke our footsteps over the rocks and stumps the inn set back from the road in a big grove of trees and it looked fine with its broad porches and a lot of women in white dresses rocking in the shade the rest of crow knob was a post office and some scenery set an angle of forty five degrees and a welkin well sir when we got to the gate who do you suppose comes down the walk to greet us old smoke em out smithers who used to be the best open air painless dentist and electric liver pad faker in the southwest old smoke em out is dressed clerico rural and has the mingled air of a landlord and a claim jumper which aspect he corroborates by telling us that he is the host and perpetrator of woodchuck inn i introduces andy and we talk about a few volatile topics such as will go around at meetings of boards of directors and old associates like us three were old smoke em out leads us into a kind of summer house in the yard near the gate and took up the harp of life and smote on all the chords with his mighty right gents says he i m glad to see you maybe you can help me out of a scrape i m getting a bit old for street work so i leased this dogdays emporium so the good things would come to me two weeks before the season opened i gets a letter signed lieut peary and one from the duke of marlborough each wanting to engage board for part of the summer well sir you gents know what a big thing for an obscure hustlery it would be to have for guests two gentlemen whose names are famous from long association with icebergs and the coburgs so i prints a lot of handbills announcing that woodchuck inn would shelter these distinguished boarders during the summer except in places where it leaked and i sends em out to towns around as far as knoxville and charlotte and fish dam and bowling green and now look up there on the porch gents says smoke em out at them disconsolate specimens of their fair sex waiting for the arrival of the duke and the lieutenant the house is packed from rafters to cellar with hero worshippers there s four normal school teachers and two abnormal there s three high school graduates between and there s two literary old maids and one that can write there s a couple of society women and a lady from haw river two elocutionists are bunking in the corn crib and i ve put cots in the hay loft for the cook and the society editress of the chattanooga opera glass you see how names draw gents well says i how is it that you seem to be biting your thumbs at good luck you didn t use to be that way i ain t through says smoke em out yesterday was the day for the advent of the auspicious personages i goes down to the depot to welcome em two apparently animate substances gets off the train both carrying bags full of croquet mallets and these magic lanterns with pushbuttons i compares these integers with the original signatures to the letters and well gents i reckon the mistake was due to my poor eyesight instead of being the lieutenant the daisy chain and wild verbena explorer was none other than levi t peevy a soda water clerk from asheville and the duke of marlborough turned out to be theo drake of murfreesborough a bookkeeper in a grocery what did i do i kicked em both back on the train and watched em depart for the lowlands the low now you see the fix i m in gents goes on smoke em out smithers i told the ladies that the notorious visitors had been detained on the road by some unavoidable circumstances that made a noise like an ice jam and an heiress but they would arrive a day or two later when they find out that they ve been deceived says smoke em out every yard of cross barred muslin and natural waved switch in the house will pack up and leave it s a hard deal says old smoke em out friend says andy touching the old man on the sophagus why this jeremiad when the polar regions and the portals of blenheim are conspiring to hand you prosperity on a hall marked silver salver we have arrived a light breaks out on smoke em out s face can you do it gents he asks could ye do it could ye play the polar man and the little duke for the nice ladies will ye do it i see that andy is superimposed with his old hankering for the oral and polyglot system of buncoing that man had a vocabulary of about words and synonyms which arrayed themselves into contraband sophistries and parables when they came out listen says andy to old smoke em out can we do it you behold before you mr smithers two of the finest equipped men on earth for inveigling the proletariat whether by word of mouth sleight of hand or swiftness of foot dukes come and go explorers go and get lost but me and jeff peters says andy go after the come ons forever if you say so we re the two illustrious guests you were expecting and you ll find says andy that we ll give you the true local color of the title r les from the aurora borealis to the ducal portcullis old smoke em out is delighted he takes me and andy up to the inn by an arm apiece telling us on the way that the finest fruits of the can and luxuries of the fast freights should be ours without price as long as we would stay on the porch smoke em out says ladies i have the honor to introduce his gracefulness the duke of marlborough and the famous inventor of the north pole lieut peary the skirts all flutter and the rocking chairs squeak as me and andy bows and then goes on in with old smoke em out to register and then we washed up and turned our cuffs and the landlord took us to the rooms he d been saving for us and got out a demijohn of north carolina real mountain dew i expected trouble when andy began to drink he has the artistic metempsychosis which is half drunk when sober and looks down on airships when stimulated after lingering with the demijohn me and andy goes out on the porch where the ladies are to begin to earn our keep we sit in two special chairs and then the schoolma ams and literaterrers hunched their rockers close around us one lady says to me how did that last venture of yours turn out sir now i d clean forgot to have an understanding with andy which i was to be the duke or the lieutenant and i couldn t tell from her question whether she was referring to arctic or matrimonial expeditions so i gave an answer that would cover both cases well ma am says i it was a freeze out right smart of a freeze out ma am and then the flood gates of andy s perorations was opened and i knew which one of the renowned ostensible guests i was supposed to be i wasn t either andy was both and still furthermore it seemed that he was trying to be the mouthpiece of the whole british nobility and of arctic exploration from sir john franklin down it was the union of corn whiskey and the conscientious fictional form that mr w d howletts admires so much ladies says andy smiling semicircularly i am truly glad to visit america i do not consider the magna charta says he or gas balloons or snow shoes in any way a detriment to the beauty and charm of your american women skyscrapers or the architecture of your icebergs the next time says andy that i go after the north pole all the vanderbilts in greenland won t be able to turn me out in the cold i mean make it hot for me tell us about one of your trips lieutenant says one of the normals sure says andy getting the decision over a hiccup it was in the spring of last year that i sailed the castle of blenheim up to latitude degrees fahrenheit and beat the record ladies says andy it was a sad sight to see a duke allied by a civil and liturgical chattel mortgage to one of your first families lost in a region of semiannual days and then he goes on at four bells we sighted westminster abbey but there was not a drop to eat at noon we threw out five sandbags and the ship rose fifteen knots higher at midnight continues andy the restaurants closed sitting on a cake of ice we ate seven hot dogs all around us was snow and ice six times a night the boatswain rose up and tore a leaf off the calendar so we could keep time with the barometer at says andy with a lot of anguish on his face three huge polar bears sprang down the hatchway into the cabin and then what then lieutenant says a schoolma am excitedly andy gives a loud sob the duchess shook me he cries out and slides out of the chair and weeps on the porch well of course that fixed the scheme the women boarders all left the next morning the landlord wouldn t speak to us for two days but when he found we had money to pay our way he loosened up so me and andy had a quiet restful summer after all coming away from crow knob with that we enticed out of old smoke em out playing seven up shearing the wolf jeff peters was always eloquent when the ethics of his profession was under discussion the only times said he that me and andy tucker ever had any hiatuses in our cordial intents was when we differed on the moral aspects of grafting andy had his standards and i had mine i didn t approve of all of andy s schemes for levying contributions from the public and he thought i allowed my conscience to interfere too often for the financial good of the firm we had high arguments sometimes one word led on to another till he said i reminded him of rockefeller i don t know how you mean that andy says i but we have been friends too long for me to take offense at a taunt that you will regret when you cool off i have yet says i to shake hands with a subpoena server one summer me and andy decided to rest up a spell in a fine little town in the mountains of kentucky called grassdale we was supposed to be horse drovers and good decent citizens besides taking a summer vacation the grassdale people liked us and me and andy declared a cessation of hostilities never so much as floating the fly leaf of a rubber concession prospectus or flashing a brazilian diamond while we was there one day the leading hardware merchant of grassdale drops around to the hotel where me and andy stopped and smokes with us sociable on the side porch we knew him pretty well from pitching quoits in the afternoons in the court house yard he was a loud red man breathing hard but fat and respectable beyond all reason after we talk on all the notorious themes of the day this murkison for such was his entitlements takes a letter out of his coat pocket in a careful careless way and hands it to us to read now what do you think of that says he laughing a letter like that to me me and andy sees at a glance what it is but we pretend to read it through it was one of them old time typewritten green goods letters explaining how for you could get in bills that an expert couldn t tell from the genuine and going on to tell how they were made from plates stolen by an employee of the treasury at washington think of em sending a letter like that to me says murkison again lot s of good men get em says andy if you don t answer the first letter they let you drop if you answer it they write again asking you to come on with your money and do business but think of em writing to me says murkison a few days later he drops around again boys says he i know you are all right or i wouldn t confide in you i wrote to them rascals again just for fun they answered and told me to come on to chicago they said telegraph to j smith when i would start when i get there i m to wait on a certain street corner till a man in a gray suit comes along and drops a newspaper in front of me then i am to ask him how the water is and he knows it s me and i know it s him ah yes says andy gaping it s the same old game i ve often read about it in the papers then he conducts you to the private abattoir in the hotel where mr jones is already waiting they show you brand new real money and sell you all you want at five for one you see em put it in a satchel for you and know it s there of course it s brown paper when you come to look at it afterward oh they couldn t switch it on me says murkison i haven t built up the best paying business in grassdale without having witticisms about me you say it s real money they show you mr tucker i ve always i see by the papers that it always is says andy boys says murkison i ve got it in my mind that them fellows can t fool me i think i ll put a couple of thousand in my jeans and go up there and put it all over em if bill murkison gets his eyes once on them bills they show him he ll never take em off of em they offer for and they ll have to stick to the bargain if i tackle em that s the kind of trader bill murkison is yes i jist believe i ll drop up chicago way and take a to shot on j smith i guess the water ll be fine enough me and andy tries to get this financial misquotation out of murkison s head but we might as well have tried to keep the man who rolls peanuts with a toothpick from betting on bryan s election no sir he was going to perform a public duty by catching these green goods swindlers at their own game maybe it would teach em a lesson after murkison left us me and andy sat a while prepondering over our silent meditations and heresies of reason in our idle hours we always improved our higher selves by ratiocination and mental thought jeff says andy after a long time quite unseldom i have seen fit to impugn your molars when you have been chewing the rag with me about your conscientious way of doing business i may have been often wrong but here is a case where i think we can agree i feel that it would be wrong for us to allow mr murkison to go alone to meet those chicago green goods men there is but one way it can end don t you think we would both feel better if we was to intervene in some way and prevent the doing of this deed i got up and shook andy tucker s hand hard and long andy says i i may have had one or two hard thoughts about the heartlessness of your corporation but i retract em now you have a kind nucleus at the interior of your exterior after all it does you credit i was just thinking the same thing that you have expressed it would not be honorable or praiseworthy says i for us to let murkison go on with this project he has taken up if he is determined to go let us go with him and prevent this swindle from coming off andy agreed with me and i was glad to see that he was in earnest about breaking up this green goods scheme i don t call myself a religious man says i or a fanatic in moral bigotry but i can t stand still and see a man who has built up his business by his own efforts and brains and risk be robbed by an unscrupulous trickster who is a menace to the public good right jeff says andy we ll stick right along with murkison if he insists on going and block this funny business i d hate to see any money dropped in it as bad as you would well we went to see murkison no boys says he i can t consent to let the song of this chicago siren waft by me on the summer breeze i ll fry some fat out of this ignis fatuus or burn a hole in the skillet but i d be plumb diverted to death to have you all go along with me maybe you could help some when it comes to cashing in the ticket to that to shot yes i d really take it as a pastime and regalement if you boys would go along too murkison gives it out in grassdale that he is going for a few days with mr peters and mr tucker to look over some iron ore property in west virginia he wires j smith that he will set foot in the spider web on a given date and the three of us lights out for chicago on the way murkison amuses himself with premonitions and advance pleasant recollections in a gray suit says he on the southwest corner of wabash avenue and lake street he drops the paper and i ask how the water is oh my my my and then he laughs all over for five minutes sometimes murkison was serious and tried to talk himself out of his cogitations whatever they was boys says he i wouldn t have this to get out in grassdale for ten times a thousand dollars it would ruin me there but i know you all are all right i think it s the duty of every citizen says he to try to do up these robbers that prey upon the public i ll show em whether the water s fine five dollars for one that s what j smith offers and he ll have to keep his contract if he does business with bill murkison we got into chicago about p m murkison was to meet the gray man at half past we had dinner at a hotel and then went up to murkison s room to wait for the time to come now boys says murkison let s get our gumption together and inoculate a plan for defeating the enemy suppose while i m exchanging airy bandage with the gray capper you gents come along by accident you know and holler hello murk and shake hands with symptoms of surprise and familiarity then i take the capper aside and tell him you all are jenkins and brown of grassdale groceries and feed good men and maybe willing to take a chance while away from home bring em along he ll say of course if they care to invest now how does that scheme strike you what do you say jeff says andy looking at me why i ll tell you what i say says i i say let s settle this thing right here now i don t see any use of wasting any more time i took a nickel plated out of my pocket and clicked the cylinder around a few times you undevout sinful insidious hog says i to murkison get out that two thousand and lay it on the table obey with velocity says i for otherwise alternatives are impending i am preferably a man of mildness but now and then i find myself in the middle of extremities such men as you i went on after he had laid the money out is what keeps the jails and court houses going you come up here to rob these men of their money does it excuse you i asks that they were trying to skin you no sir you was going to rob peter to stand off paul you are ten times worse says i than that green goods man you go to church at home and pretend to be a decent citizen but you ll come to chicago and commit larceny from men that have built up a sound and profitable business by dealing with such contemptible scoundrels as you have tried to be to day how do you know says i that that green goods man hasn t a large family dependent upon his extortions it s you supposedly respectable citizens who are always on the lookout to get something for nothing says i that support the lotteries and wild cat mines and stock exchanges and wire tappers of this country if it wasn t for you they d go out of business the green goods man you was going to rob says i studied maybe for years to learn his trade every turn he makes he risks his money and liberty and maybe his life you come up here all sanctified and vanoplied with respectability and a pleasing post office address to swindle him if he gets the money you can squeal to the police if you get it he hocks the gray suit to buy supper and says nothing mr tucker and me sized you up says i and came along to see that you got what you deserved hand over the money says i you grass fed hypocrite i put the two thousand which was all in bills in my inside pocket now get out your watch says i to murkison no i don t want it says i lay it on the table and you sit in that chair till it ticks off an hour then you can go if you make any noise or leave any sooner we ll handbill you all over grassdale i guess your high position there is worth more than to you then me and andy left on the train andy was a long time silent then he says jeff do you mind my asking you a question two says i or forty was that the idea you had says he when we started out with murkison why certainly says i what else could it have been wasn t it yours too in about half an hour andy spoke again i think there are times when andy don t exactly understand my system of ethics and moral hygiene jeff says he some time when you have the leisure i wish you d draw off a diagram and foot notes of that conscience of yours i d like to have it to refer to occasionally innocents of broadway i hope some day to retire from business said jeff peters and when i do i don t want anybody to be able to say that i ever got a dollar of any man s money without giving him a quid pro rata for it i ve always managed to leave a customer some little gewgaw to paste in his scrapbook or stick between his seth thomas clock and the wall after we are through trading there was one time i came near having to break this rule of mine and do a profligate and illaudable action but i was saved from it by the laws and statutes of our great and profitable country one summer me and andy tucker my partner went to new york to lay in our annual assortment of clothes and gents furnishings we was always pompous and regardless dressers finding that looks went further than anything else in our business except maybe our knowledge of railroad schedules and an autograph photo of the president that loeb sent us probably by mistake andy wrote a nature letter once and sent it in about animals that he had seen caught in a trap lots of times loeb must have read it triplets instead of trap lots and sent the photo anyhow it was useful to us to show people as a guarantee of good faith me and andy never cared much to do business in new york it was too much like pothunting catching suckers in that town is like dynamiting a texas lake for bass all you have to do anywhere between the north and east rivers is to stand in the street with an open bag marked drop packages of money here no checks or loose bills taken you have a cop handy to club pikers who try to chip in post office orders and canadian money and that s all there is to new york for a hunter who loves his profession so me and andy used to just nature fake the town we d get out our spyglasses and watch the woodcocks along the broadway swamps putting plaster casts on their broken legs and then we d sneak away without firing a shot one day in the papier m ch palm room of a chloral hydrate and hops agency in a side street about eight inches off broadway me and andy had thrust upon us the acquaintance of a new yorker we had beer together until we discovered that each of us knew a man named hellsmith traveling for a stove factory in duluth this caused us to remark that the world was a very small place and then this new yorker busts his string and takes off his tin foil and excelsior packing and starts in giving us his ellen terris beginning with the time he used to sell shoelaces to the indians on the spot where tammany hall now stands this new yorker had made his money keeping a cigar store in beekman street and he hadn t been above fourteenth street in ten years moreover he had whiskers and the time had gone by when a true sport will do anything to a man with whiskers no grafter except a boy who is soliciting subscribers to an illustrated weekly to win the prize air rifle or a widow would have the heart to tamper with the man behind with the razor he was a typical city reub i d bet the man hadn t been out of sight of a skyscraper in twenty five years well presently this metropolitan backwoodsman pulls out a roll of bills with an old blue sleeve elastic fitting tight around it and opens it up there s mr peters says he shoving it over the table to me saved during my fifteen years of business put that in your pocket and keep it for me mr peters i m glad to meet you gentlemen from the west and i may take a drop too much i want you to take care of my money for me now let s have another beer you d better keep this yourself says i we are strangers to you and you can t trust everybody you meet put your roll back in your pocket says i and you d better run along home before some farm hand from the kaw river bottoms strolls in here and sells you a copper mine oh i don t know says whiskers i guess little old new york can take care of herself i guess i know a man that s on the square when i see him i ve always found the western people all right i ask you as a favor mr peters says he to keep that roll in your pocket for me i know a gentleman when i see him and now let s have some more beer in about ten minutes this fall of manna leans back in his chair and snores andy looks at me and says i reckon i d better stay with him for five minutes or so in case the waiter comes in i went out the side door and walked half a block up the street and then i came back and sat down at the table andy says i i can t do it it s too much like swearing off taxes i can t go off with this man s money without doing something to earn it like taking advantage of the bankrupt act or leaving a bottle of eczema lotion in his pocket to make it look more like a square deal well says andy it does seem kind of hard on one s professional pride to lope off with a bearded pard s competency especially after he has nominated you custodian of his bundle in the sappy insouciance of his urban indiscrimination suppose we wake him up and see if we can formulate some commercial sophistry by which he will be enabled to give us both his money and a good excuse we wakes up whiskers he stretches himself and yawns out the hypothesis that he must have dropped off for a minute and then he says he wouldn t mind sitting in at a little gentleman s game of poker he used to play some when he attended high school in brooklyn and as he was out for a good time why and so forth andy brights up a little at that for it looks like it might be a solution to our financial troubles so we all three go to our hotel further down broadway and have the cards and chips brought up to andy s room i tried once more to make this babe in the horticultural gardens take his five thousand but no keep that little roll for me mr peters says he and oblige i ll ask you fer it when i want it i guess i know when i m among friends a man that s done business on beekman street for twenty years right in the heart of the wisest old village on earth ought to know what he s about i guess i can tell a gentleman from a con man or a flimflammer when i meet him i ve got some odd change in my clothes enough to start the game with i guess he goes through his pockets and rains gold certificates on the table till it looked like a autumn day in a lemon grove picture by turner in the salons andy almost smiled the first round that was dealt this boulevardier slaps down his hand claims low and jack and big casino and rakes in the pot andy always took a pride in his poker playing he got up from the table and looked sadly out of the window at the street cars well gentlemen says the cigar man i don t blame you for not wanting to play i ve forgotten the fine points of the game i guess it s been so long since i indulged now how long are you gentlemen going to be in the city i told him about a week longer he says that ll suit him fine his cousin is coming over from brooklyn that evening and they are going to see the sights of new york his cousin he says is in the artificial limb and lead casket business and hasn t crossed the bridge in eight years they expect to have the time of their lives and he winds up by asking me to keep his roll of money for him till next day i tried to make him take it but it only insulted him to mention it i ll use what i ve got in loose change says he you keep the rest for me i ll drop in on you and mr tucker to morrow afternoon about or says he and we ll have dinner together be good after whiskers had gone andy looked at me curious and doubtful well jeff says he it looks like the ravens are trying to feed us two elijahs so hard that if we turned em down again we ought to have the audubon society after us it won t do to put the crown aside too often i know this is something like paternalism but don t you think opportunity has skinned its knuckles about enough knocking at our door i put my feet up on the table and my hands in my pockets which is an attitude unfavorable to frivolous thoughts andy says i this man with the hirsute whiskers has got us in a predicament we can t move hand or foot with his money you and me have got a gentleman s agreement with fortune that we can t break we ve done business in the west where it s more of a fair game out there the people we skin are trying to skin us even the farmers and the remittance men that the magazines send out to write up goldfields but there s little sport in new york city for rod reel or gun they hunt here with either one of two things a slungshot or a letter of introduction the town has been stocked so full of carp that the game fish are all gone if you spread a net here do you catch legitimate suckers in it such as the lord intended to be caught fresh guys who know it all sports with a little coin and the nerve to play another man s game street crowds out for the fun of dropping a dollar or two and village smarties who know just where the little pea is no sir says i what the grafters live on here is widows and orphans and foreigners who save up a bag of money and hand it out over the first counter they see with an iron railing to it and factory girls and little shopkeepers that never leave the block they do business on that s what they call suckers here they re nothing but canned sardines and all the bait you need to catch em is a pocketknife and a soda cracker now this cigar man i went on is one of the types he s lived twenty years on one street without learning as much as you would in getting a once over shave from a lockjawed barber in a kansas crossroads town but he s a new yorker and he ll brag about that all the time when he isn t picking up live wires or getting in front of street cars or paying out money to wire tappers or standing under a safe that s being hoisted into a skyscraper when a new yorker does loosen up says i it s like the spring decomposition of the ice jam in the allegheny river he ll swamp you with cracked ice and back water if you don t get out of the way it s mighty lucky for us andy says i that this cigar exponent with the parsley dressing saw fit to bedeck us with his childlike trust and altruism for says i this money of his is an eyesore to my sense of rectitude and ethics we can t take it andy you know we can t says i for we haven t a shadow of a title to it not a shadow if there was the least bit of a way we could put in a claim to it i d be willing to see him start in for another twenty years and make another for himself but we haven t sold him anything we haven t been embroiled in a trade or anything commercial he approached us friendly says i and with blind and beautiful idiocy laid the stuff in our hands we ll have to give it back to him when he wants it your arguments says andy are past criticism or comprehension no we can t walk off with the money as things now stand i admire your conscious way of doing business jeff says andy and i wouldn t propose anything that wasn t square in line with your theories of morality and initiative but i ll be away to night and most of to morrow jeff says andy i ve got some business affairs that i want to attend to when this free greenbacks party comes in to morrow afternoon hold him here till i arrive we ve all got an engagement for dinner you know well sir about the next afternoon in trips the cigar man with his eyes half open been having a glorious time mr peters says he took in all the sights i tell you new york is the onliest only now if you don t mind says he i ll lie down on that couch and doze off for about nine minutes before mr tucker comes i m not used to being up all night and to morrow if you don t mind mr peters i ll take that five thousand i met a man last night that s got a sure winner at the racetrack to morrow excuse me for being so impolite as to go to sleep mr peters and so this inhabitant of the second city in the world reposes himself and begins to snore while i sit there musing over things and wishing i was back in the west where you could always depend on a customer fighting to keep his money hard enough to let your conscience take it from him at half past andy comes in and sees the sleeping form i ve been over to trenton says andy pulling a document out of his pocket i think i ve got this matter fixed up all right jeff look at that i open the paper and see that it is a corporation charter issued by the state of new jersey to the peters tucker consolidated and amalgamated aerial franchise development company limited it s to buy up rights of way for airship lines explained andy the legislature wasn t in session but i found a man at a postcard stand in the lobby that kept a stock of charters on hand there are shares says andy expected to reach a par value of i had one blank certificate of stock printed andy takes out the blank and begins to fill it in with a fountain pen the whole bunch says he goes to our friend in dreamland for did you learn his name make it out to bearer says i we put the certificate of stock in the cigar man s hand and went out to pack our suit cases illustration we put the certificate of stock in the cigarman s hand on the ferryboat andy says to me is your conscience easy about taking the money now jeff why shouldn t it be says i are we any better than any other holding corporation conscience in art i never could hold my partner andy tucker down to legitimate ethics of pure swindling said jeff peters to me one day andy had too much imagination to be honest he used to devise schemes of money getting so fraudulent and high financial that they wouldn t have been allowed in the bylaws of a railroad rebate system myself i never believed in taking any man s dollars unless i gave him something for it something in the way of rolled gold jewelry garden seeds lumbago lotion stock certificates stove polish or a crack on the head to show for his money i guess i must have had new england ancestors away back and inherited some of their stanch and rugged fear of the police but andy s family tree was in different kind i don t think he could have traced his descent any further back than a corporation one summer while we was in the middle west working down the ohio valley with a line of family albums headache powders and roach destroyer andy takes one of his notions of high and actionable financiering jeff says he i ve been thinking that we ought to drop these rutabaga fanciers and give our attention to something more nourishing and prolific if we keep on snapshooting these hinds for their egg money we ll be classed as nature fakers how about plunging into the fastnesses of the skyscraper country and biting some big bull caribous in the chest well says i you know my idiosyncrasies i prefer a square non illegal style of business such as we are carrying on now when i take money i want to leave some tangible object in the other fellow s hands for him to gaze at and to distract his attention from my spoor even if it s only a komical kuss trick finger ring for squirting perfume in a friend s eye but if you ve got a fresh idea andy says i let s have a look at it i m not so wedded to petty graft that i would refuse something better in the way of a subsidy i was thinking says andy of a little hunt without horn hound or camera among the great herd of the midas americanus commonly known as the pittsburg millionaires in new york i asks no sir says andy in pittsburg that s their habitat they don t like new york they go there now and then just because it s expected of em a pittsburg millionaire in new york is like a fly in a cup of hot coffee he attracts attention and comment but he don t enjoy it new york ridicules him for blowing so much money in that town of sneaks and snobs and sneers the truth is he don t spend anything while he is there i saw a memorandum of expenses for a ten days trip to bunkum town made by a pittsburg man worth once here s the way he set it down r r fare to and from cab fare to and from hotel hotel bill per day tips total that s the voice of new york goes on andy the town s nothing but a head waiter if you tip it too much it ll go and stand by the door and make fun of you to the hat check boy when a pittsburger wants to spend money and have a good time he stays at home that s where we ll go to catch him well to make a dense story more condensed me and andy cached our paris green and antipyrine powders and albums in a friend s cellar and took the trail to pittsburg andy didn t have any especial prospectus of chicanery and violence drawn up but he always had plenty of confidence that his immoral nature would rise to any occasion that presented itself as a concession to my ideas of self preservation and rectitude he promised that if i should take an active and incriminating part in any little business venture that we might work up there should be something actual and cognizant to the senses of touch sight taste or smell to transfer to the victim for the money so my conscience might rest easy after that i felt better and entered more cheerfully into the foul play andy says i as we strayed through the smoke along the cinderpath they call smithfield street had you figured out how we are going to get acquainted with these coke kings and pig iron squeezers not that i would decry my own worth or system of drawing room deportment and work with the olive fork and pie knife says i but isn t the entree nous into the salons of the stogie smokers going to be harder than you imagined if there s any handicap at all says andy it s our own refinement and inherent culture pittsburg millionaires are a fine body of plain wholehearted unassuming democratic men they are rough but uncivil in their manners and though their ways are boisterous and unpolished under it all they have a great deal of impoliteness and discourtesy nearly every one of em rose from obscurity says andy and they ll live in it till the town gets to using smoke consumers if we act simple and unaffected and don t go too far from the saloons and keep making a noise like an import duty on steel rails we won t have any trouble in meeting some of em socially well andy and me drifted about town three or four days getting our bearings we got to knowing several millionaires by sight one used to stop his automobile in front of our hotel and have a quart of champagne brought out to him when the waiter opened it he d turn it up to his mouth and drink it out of the bottle that showed he used to be a glassblower before he made his money one evening andy failed to come to the hotel for dinner about o clock he came into my room landed one jeff says he twelve millions oil rolling mills real estate and natural gas he s a fine man no airs about him made all his money in the last five years he s got professors posting him up now in education art and literature and haberdashery and such things when i saw him he d just won a bet of with a steel corporation man that there d be four suicides in the allegheny rolling mills to day so everybody in sight had to walk up and have drinks on him he took a fancy to me and asked me to dinner with him we went to a restaurant in diamond alley and sat on stools and had a sparkling moselle and clam chowder and apple fritters then he wanted to show me his bachelor apartment on liberty street he s got ten rooms over a fish market with privilege of the bath on the next floor above he told me it cost him to furnish his apartment and i believe it he s got worth of pictures in one room and worth of curios and antiques in another his name s scudder and he s and taking lessons on the piano and barrels of oil a day out of his wells all right says i preliminary canter satisfactory but kay vooly voo what good is the art junk to us and the oil now that man says andy sitting thoughtfully on the bed ain t what you would call an ordinary scutt when he was showing me his cabinet of art curios his face lighted up like the door of a coke oven he says that if some of his big deals go through he ll make j p morgan s collection of sweatshop tapestry and augusta me beadwork look like the contents of an ostrich s craw thrown on a screen by a magic lantern and then he showed me a little carving went on andy that anybody could see was a wonderful thing it was something like years old he said it was a lotus flower with a woman s face in it carved out of a solid piece of ivory scudder looks it up in a catalogue and describes it an egyptian carver named khafra made two of em for king rameses ii about the year b c the other one can t be found the junkshops and antique bugs have rubbered all europe for it but it seems to be out of stock scudder paid for the one he has oh well says i this sounds like the purling of a rill to me i thought we came here to teach the millionaires business instead of learning art from em be patient says andy kindly maybe we will see a rift in the smoke ere long all the next morning andy was out i didn t see him until about noon he came to the hotel and called me into his room across the hall he pulled a roundish bundle about as big as a goose egg out of his pocket and unwrapped it it was an ivory carving just as he had described the millionaire s to me i went in an old second hand store and pawnshop a while ago says andy and i see this half hidden under a lot of old daggers and truck the pawnbroker said he d had it several years and thinks it was soaked by some arabs or turks or some foreign dubs that used to live down by the river i offered him for it and i must have looked like i wanted it for he said it would be taking the pumpernickel out of his children s mouths to hold any conversation that did not lead up to a price of i finally got it for jeff goes on andy this is the exact counterpart of scudder s carving it s absolutely a dead ringer for it he ll pay for it as quick as he d tuck a napkin under his chin and why shouldn t it be the genuine other one anyhow that the old gypsy whittled out why not indeed says i and how shall we go about compelling him to make a voluntary purchase of it andy had his plan all ready and i ll tell you how we carried it out i got a pair of blue spectacles put on my black frock coat rumpled my hair up and became prof pickleman i went to another hotel registered and sent a telegram to scudder to come to see me at once on important art business the elevator dumped him on me in less than an hour he was a foggy man with a clarion voice smelling of connecticut wrappers and naphtha hello profess he shouts how s your conduct i rumpled my hair some more and gave him a blue glass stare sir says i are you cornelius t scudder of pittsburg pennsylvania i am says he come out and have a drink i ve neither the time nor the desire says i for such harmful and deleterious amusements i have come from new york says i on a matter of busi on a matter of art i learned there that you are the owner of an egyptian ivory carving of the time of rameses ii representing the head of queen isis in a lotus flower there were only two of such carvings made one has been lost for many years i recently discovered and purchased the other in a pawn in an obscure museum in vienna i wish to purchase yours name your price well the great ice jams profess says scudder have you found the other one me sell no i don t guess cornelius scudder needs to sell anything that he wants to keep have you got the carving with you profess i shows it to scudder he examines it careful all over it s the article says he it s a duplicate of mine every line and curve of it tell you what i ll do he says i won t sell but i ll buy give you for yours since you won t sell i will says i large bills please i m a man of few words i must return to new york to night i lecture to morrow at the aquarium scudder sends a check down and the hotel cashes it he goes off with his piece of antiquity and i hurry back to andy s hotel according to arrangement andy is walking up and down the room looking at his watch well he says twenty five hundred says i cash we ve got just eleven minutes says andy to catch the b o westbound grab your baggage what s the hurry says i it was a square deal and even if it was only an imitation of the original carving it ll take him some time to find it out he seemed to be sure it was the genuine article it was says andy it was his own when i was looking at his curios yesterday he stepped out of the room for a moment and i pocketed it now will you pick up your suit case and hurry then says i why was that story about finding another one in the pawn oh says andy out of respect for that conscience of yours come on the man higher up across our two dishes of spaghetti in a corner of provenzano s restaurant jeff peters was explaining to me the three kinds of graft every winter jeff comes to new york to eat spaghetti to watch the shipping in east river from the depths of his chinchilla overcoat and to lay in a supply of chicago made clothing at one of the fulton street stores during the other three seasons he may be found further west his range is from spokane to tampa in his profession he takes a pride which he supports and defends with a serious and unique philosophy of ethics his profession is no new one he is an incorporated uncapitalized unlimited asylum for the reception of the restless and unwise dollars of his fellowmen in the wilderness of stone in which jeff seeks his annual lonely holiday he is glad to palaver of his many adventures as a boy will whistle after sundown in a wood wherefore i mark on my calendar the time of his coming and open a question of privilege at provenzano s concerning the little wine stained table in the corner between the rakish rubber plant and the framed palazzio della something on the wall there are two kinds of graft said jeff that ought to be wiped out by law i mean wall street speculation and burglary nearly everybody will agree with you as to one of them said i with a laugh well burglary ought to be wiped out too said jeff and i wondered whether the laugh had been redundant about three months ago said jeff it was my privilege to become familiar with a sample of each of the aforesaid branches of illegitimate art i was sine qua grata with a member of the housebreakers union and one of the john d napoleons of finance at the same time interesting combination said i with a yawn did i tell you i bagged a duck and a ground squirrel at one shot last week over in the ramapos i knew well how to draw jeff s stories let me tell you first about these barnacles that clog the wheels of society by poisoning the springs of rectitude with their upas like eye said jeff with the pure gleam of the muck raker in his own as i said three months ago i got into bad company there are two times in a man s life when he does this when he s dead broke and when he s rich now and then the most legitimate business runs out of luck it was out in arkansas i made the wrong turn at a cross road and drives into this town of peavine by mistake it seems i had already assaulted and disfigured peavine the spring of the year before i had sold worth of young fruit trees there plums cherries peaches and pears the peaviners were keeping an eye on the country road and hoping i might pass that way again i drove down main street as far as the crystal palace drugstore before i realized i had committed ambush upon myself and my white horse bill the peaviners took me by surprise and bill by the bridle and began a conversation that wasn t entirely disassociated with the subject of fruit trees a committee of em ran some trace chains through the armholes of my vest and escorted me through their gardens and orchards their fruit trees hadn t lived up to their labels most of em had turned out to be persimmons and dogwoods with a grove or two of blackjacks and poplars the only one that showed any signs of bearing anything was a fine young cottonwood that had put forth a hornet s nest and half of an old corset cover the peaviners protracted our fruitless stroll to the edge of town they took my watch and money on account and they kept bill and the wagon as hostages they said the first time one of them dogwood trees put forth an amsden s june peach i might come back and get my things then they took off the trace chains and jerked their thumbs in the direction of the rocky mountains and i struck a lewis and clark lope for the swollen rivers and impenetrable forests when i regained intellectualness i found myself walking into an unidentified town on the a t s f railroad the peaviners hadn t left anything in my pockets except a plug of chewing they wasn t after my life and that saved it i bit off a chunk and sits down on a pile of ties by the track to recogitate my sensations of thought and perspicacity and then along comes a fast freight which slows up a little at the town and off of it drops a black bundle that rolls for twenty yards in a cloud of dust and then gets up and begins to spit soft coal and interjections i see it is a young man broad across the face dressed more for pullmans than freights and with a cheerful kind of smile in spite of it all that made phoebe snow s job look like a chimney sweep s fall off says i nunk says he got off arrived at my destination what town is this haven t looked it up on the map yet says i i got in about five minutes before you did how does it strike you hard says he twisting one of his arms around i believe that shoulder no it s all right he stoops over to brush the dust off his clothes when out of his pocket drops a fine nine inch burglar s steel jimmy he picks it up and looks at me sharp and then grins and holds out his hand brother says he greetings didn t i see you in southern missouri last summer selling colored sand at half a dollar a teaspoonful to put into lamps to keep the oil from exploding oil says i never explodes it s the gas that forms that explodes but i shakes hands with him anyway my name s bill bassett says he to me and if you ll call it professional pride instead of conceit i ll inform you that you have the pleasure of meeting the best burglar that ever set a gum shoe on ground drained by the mississippi river well me and this bill bassett sits on the ties and exchanges brags as artists in kindred lines will do it seems he didn t have a cent either and we went into close caucus he explained why an able burglar sometimes had to travel on freights by telling me that a servant girl had played him false in little rock and he was making a quick get away it s part of my business says bill bassett to play up to the ruffles when i want to make a riffle as raffles tis loves that makes the bit go round show me a house with a swag in it and a pretty parlor maid and you might as well call the silver melted down and sold and me spilling truffles and that chateau stuff on the napkin under my chin while the police are calling it an inside job just because the old lady s nephew teaches a bible class i first make an impression on the girl says bill and when she lets me inside i make an impression on the locks but this one in little rock done me says he she saw me taking a trolley ride with another girl and when i came round on the night she was to leave the door open for me it was fast and i had keys made for the doors upstairs but no sir she had sure cut off my locks she was a delilah says bill bassett it seems that bill tried to break in anyhow with his jimmy but the girl emitted a succession of bravura noises like the top riders of a tally ho and bill had to take all the hurdles between there and the depot as he had no baggage they tried hard to check his departure but he made a train that was just pulling out well says bill bassett when we had exchanged memories of our dead lives i could eat this town don t look like it was kept under a yale lock suppose we commit some mild atrocity that will bring in temporary expense money i don t suppose you ve brought along any hair tonic or rolled gold watch chains or similar law defying swindles that you could sell on the plaza to the pikers of the paretic populace have you no says i i left an elegant line of patagonian diamond earrings and rainy day sunbursts in my valise at peavine but they re to stay there until some of those black gum trees begin to glut the market with yellow clings and japanese plums i reckon we can t count on them unless we take luther burbank in for a partner very well says bassett we ll do the best we can maybe after dark i ll borrow a hairpin from some lady and open the farmers and drovers marine bank with it while we were talking up pulls a passenger train to the depot near by a person in a high hat gets off on the wrong side of the train and comes tripping down the track towards us he was a little fat man with a big nose and rat s eyes but dressed expensive and carrying a hand satchel careful as if it had eggs or railroads bonds in it he passes by us and keeps on down the track not appearing to notice the town come on says bill bassett to me starting after him where i asks lordy says bill had you forgot you was in the desert didn t you see colonel manna drop down right before your eyes don t you hear the rustling of general raven s wings i m surprised at you elijah we overtook the stranger in the edge of some woods and as it was after sun down and in a quiet place nobody saw us stop him bill takes the silk hat off the man s head and brushes it with his sleeve and puts it back what does this mean sir says the man when i wore one of these says bill and felt embarrassed i always done that not having one now i had to use yours i hardly know how to begin sir in explaining our business with you but i guess we ll try your pockets first bill bassett felt in all of them and looked disgusted not even a watch he says ain t you ashamed of yourself you whited sculpture going about dressed like a head waiter and financed like a count you haven t even got carfare what did you do with your transfer the man speaks up and says he has no assets or valuables of any sort but bassett takes his hand satchel and opens it out comes some collars and socks and a half a page of a newspaper clipped out bill reads the clipping careful and holds out his hand to the held up party brother says he greetings accept the apologies of friends i am bill bassett the burglar mr peters you must make the acquaintance of mr alfred e ricks shake hands mr peters says bill stands about halfway between me and you mr ricks in the line of havoc and corruption he always gives something for the money he gets i m glad to meet you mr ricks you and mr peters this is the first time i ever attended a full gathering of the national synod of sharks housebreaking swindling and financiering all represented please examine mr rick s credentials mr peters the piece of newspaper that bill bassett handed me had a good picture of this ricks on it it was a chicago paper and it had obloquies of ricks in every paragraph by reading it over i harvested the intelligence that said alleged ricks had laid off all that portion of the state of florida that lies under water into town lots and sold em to alleged innocent investors from his magnificently furnished offices in chicago after he had taken in a hundred thousand or so dollars one of these fussy purchasers that are always making trouble i ve had em actually try gold watches i ve sold em with acid took a cheap excursion down to the land where it is always just before supper to look at his lot and see if it didn t need a new paling or two on the fence and market a few lemons in time for the christmas present trade he hires a surveyor to find his lot for him they run the line out and find the flourishing town of paradise hollow so advertised to be about rods and poles s degrees e of the middle of lake okeechobee this man s lot was under thirty six feet of water and besides had been preempted so long by the alligators and gars that his title looked fishy naturally the man goes back to chicago and makes it as hot for alfred e ricks as the morning after a prediction of snow by the weather bureau ricks defied the allegation but he couldn t deny the alligators one morning the papers came out with a column about it and ricks come out by the fire escape it seems the alleged authorities had beat him to the safe deposit box where he kept his winnings and ricks has to westward ho with only feetwear and a dozen and a half english pokes in his shopping bag he happened to have some mileage left in his book and that took him as far as the town in the wilderness where he was spilled out on me and bill bassett as elijah iii with not a raven in sight for any of us then this alfred e ricks lets out a squeak that he is hungry too and denies the hypothesis that he is good for the value let alone the price of a meal and so there was the three of us representing if we had a mind to draw syllogisms and parabolas labor and trade and capital now when trade has no capital there isn t a dicker to be made and when capital has no money there s a stagnation in steak and onions that put it up to the man with the jimmy brother bushrangers says bill bassett never yet in trouble did i desert a pal hard by in yon wood i seem to see unfurnished lodgings let us go there and wait till dark there was an old deserted cabin in the grove and we three took possession of it after dark bill bassett tells us to wait and goes out for half an hour he comes back with a armful of bread and spareribs and pies panhandled em at a farmhouse on washita avenue says he eat drink and be leary the full moon was coming up bright so we sat on the floor of the cabin and ate in the light of it and this bill bassett begins to brag sometimes says he with his mouth full of country produce i lose all patience with you people that think you are higher up in the profession than i am now what could either of you have done in the present emergency to set us on our feet again could you do it ricksy i must confess mr bassett says ricks speaking nearly inaudible out of a slice of pie that at this immediate juncture i could not perhaps promote an enterprise to relieve the situation large operations such as i direct naturally require careful preparation in advance i i know ricksy breaks in bill bassett you needn t finish you need to make the first payment on a blond typewriter and four roomsful of quartered oak furniture and you need more for advertising contracts and you need two weeks time for the fish to begin to bite your line of relief would be about as useful in an emergency as advocating municipal ownership to cure a man suffocated by eighty cent gas and your graft ain t much swifter brother peters he winds up oh says i i haven t seen you turn anything into gold with your wand yet mr good fairy most anybody could rub the magic ring for a little left over victuals that was only getting the pumpkin ready says bassett braggy and cheerful the coach and six ll drive up to the door before you know it miss cinderella maybe you ve got some scheme under your sleeve holders that will give us a start son says i i m fifteen years older than you are and young enough yet to take out an endowment policy i ve been broke before we can see the lights of that town not half a mile away i learned under montague silver the greatest street man that ever spoke from a wagon there are hundreds of men walking those streets this moment with grease spots on their clothes give me a gasoline lamp a dry goods box and a two dollar bar of white castile soap cut into little where s your two dollars snickered bill bassett into my discourse there was no use arguing with that burglar no he goes on you re both babes in the wood finance has closed the mahogany desk and trade has put the shutters up both of you look to labor to start the wheels going all right you admit it to night i ll show you what bill bassett can do bassett tells me and ricks not to leave the cabin till he comes back even if it s daylight and then he starts off toward town whistling gay this alfred e ricks pulls off his shoes and his coat lays a silk handkerchief over his hat and lays down on the floor i think i will endeavor to secure a little slumber he squeaks the day has been fatiguing good night my dear mr peters my regards to morpheus says i i think i ll sit up a while about two o clock as near as i could guess by my watch in peavine home comes our laboring man and kicks up ricks and calls us to the streak of bright moonlight shining in the cabin door then he spreads out five packages of one thousand dollars each on the floor and begins to cackle over the nest egg like a hen i ll tell you a few things about that town says he it s named rocky springs and they re building a masonic temple and it looks like the democratic candidate for mayor is going to get soaked by a pop and judge tucker s wife who has been down with pleurisy is getting some better i had a talk on these liliputian thesises before i could get a siphon in the fountain of knowledge that i was after and there s a bank there called the lumberman s fidelity and plowman s savings institution it closed for business yesterday with cash on hand it will open this morning with all silver that s the reason i didn t bring more there you are trade and capital now will you be bad my young friend says alfred e ricks holding up his hands have you robbed this bank dear me dear me you couldn t call it that says bassett robbing sounds harsh all i had to do was to find out what street it was on that town is so quiet that i could stand on the corner and hear the tumblers clicking in that safe lock right to left twice to right once to left to as plain as the yale captain giving orders in the football dialect now boys says bassett this is an early rising town they tell me the citizens are all up and stirring before daylight i asked what for and they said because breakfast was ready at that time and what of merry robin hood it must be yoicks and away with the tinkers chorus i ll stake you how much do you want speak up capital my dear young friend says this ground squirrel of a ricks standing on his hind legs and juggling nuts in his paws i have friends in denver who would assist me if i had a hundred dollars i basset unpins a package of the currency and throws five twenties to ricks trade how much he says to me put your money up labor says i i never yet drew upon honest toil for its hard earned pittance the dollars i get are surplus ones that are burning the pockets of damfools and greenhorns when i stand on a street corner and sell a solid gold diamond ring to a yap for i make just and i know he s going to give it to a girl in return for all the benefits accruing from a ring his profits are which of us is the biggest fakir and when you sell a poor woman a pinch of sand for fifty cents to keep her lamp from exploding says bassett what do you figure her gross earnings to be with sand at forty cents a ton listen says i i instruct her to keep her lamp clean and well filled if she does that it can t burst and with the sand in it she knows it can t and she don t worry it s a kind of industrial christian science she pays fifty cents and gets both rockefeller and mrs eddy on the job it ain t everybody that can let the gold dust twins do their work alfred e ricks all but licks the dust off of bill bassett s shoes my dear young friend says he i will never forget your generosity heaven will reward you but let me implore you to turn from your ways of violence and crime mousie says bill the hole in the wainscoting for yours your dogmas and inculcations sound to me like the last words of a bicycle pump what has your high moral elevator service system of pillage brought you to penuriousness and want even brother peters who insists upon contaminating the art of robbery with theories of commerce and trade admitted he was on the lift both of you live by the gilded rule brother peters says bill you d better choose a slice of this embalmed currency you re welcome i told bill bassett once more to put his money in his pocket i never had the respect for burglary that some people have i always gave something for the money i took even if it was only some little trifle for a souvenir to remind em not to get caught again and then alfred e ricks grovels at bill s feet again and bids us adieu he says he will have a team at a farmhouse and drive to the station below and take the train for denver it salubrified the atmosphere when that lamentable boll worm took his departure he was a disgrace to every non industrial profession in the country with all his big schemes and fine offices he had wound up unable even to get an honest meal except by the kindness of a strange and maybe unscrupulous burglar i was glad to see him go though i felt a little sorry for him now that he was ruined forever what could such a man do without a big capital to work with why alfred e ricks as we left him was as helpless as turtle on its back he couldn t have worked a scheme to beat a little girl out of a penny slate pencil when me and bill bassett was left alone i did a little sleight of mind turn in my head with a trade secret at the end of it thinks i i ll show this mr burglar man the difference between business and labor he had hurt some of my professional self adulation by casting his persians upon commerce and trade i won t take any of your money as a gift mr bassett says i to him but if you ll pay my expenses as a travelling companion until we get out of the danger zone of the immoral deficit you have caused in this town s finances to night i ll be obliged bill bassett agreed to that and we hiked westward as soon as we could catch a safe train when we got to a town in arizona called los perros i suggested that we once more try our luck on terra cotta that was the home of montague silver my old instructor now retired from business i knew monty would stake me to web money if i could show him a fly buzzing round the locality bill bassett said all towns looked alike to him as he worked mainly in the dark so we got off the train in los perros a fine little town in the silver region i had an elegant little sure thing in the way of a commercial slungshot that i intended to hit bassett behind the ear with i wasn t going to take his money while he was asleep but i was going to leave him with a lottery ticket that would represent in experience to him i think that was the amount he had when we got off the train but the first time i hinted to him about an investment he turns on me and disencumbers himself of the following terms and expressions brother peters says he it ain t a bad idea to go into an enterprise of some kind as you suggest i think i will but if i do it will be such a cold proposition that nobody but robert e peary and charlie fairbanks will be able to sit on the board of directors i thought you might want to turn your money over says i i do says he frequently i can t sleep on one side all night i ll tell you brother peters says he i m going to start a poker room i don t seem to care for the humdrum in swindling such as peddling egg beaters and working off breakfast food on barnum and bailey for sawdust to strew in their circus rings but the gambling business says he from the profitable side of the table is a good compromise between swiping silver spoons and selling penwipers at a waldorf astoria charity bazar then says i mr bassett you don t care to talk over my little business proposition why says he do you know you can t get a pasteur institute to start up within fifty miles of where i live i bite so seldom so bassett rents a room over a saloon and looks around for some furniture and chromos the same night i went to monty silver s house and he let me have on my prospects then i went to the only store in los perros that sold playing cards and bought every deck in the house the next morning when the store opened i was there bringing all the cards back with me i said that my partner that was going to back me in the game had changed his mind and i wanted to sell the cards back again the storekeeper took em at half price yes i was seventy five dollars loser up to that time but while i had the cards that night i marked every one in every deck that was labor and then trade and commerce had their innings and the bread i had cast upon the waters began to come back in the form of cottage pudding with wine sauce of course i was among the first to buy chips at bill bassett s game he had bought the only cards there was to be had in town and i knew the back of every one of them better than i know the back of my head when the barber shows me my haircut in the two mirrors when the game closed i had the five thousand and a few odd dollars and all bill bassett had was the wanderlust and a black cat he had bought for a mascot bill shook hands with me when i left brother peters says he i have no business being in business i was preordained to labor when a no burglar tries to make a james out of his jimmy he perpetrates an improfundity you have a well oiled and efficacious system of luck at cards says he peace go with you and i never afterward sees bill bassett again well jeff said i when the autolycan adventurer seemed to have divulged the gist of his tale i hope you took care of the money that would be a respecta that is a considerable working capital if you should choose some day to settle down to some sort of regular business me said jeff virtuously you can bet i ve taken care of that five thousand he tapped his coat over the region of his chest exultantly gold mining stock he explained every cent of it shares par value one dollar bound to go up per cent within a year non assessable the blue gopher mine just discovered a month ago better get in yourself if you ve any spare dollars on hand sometimes said i these mines are not oh this one s solid as an old goose said jeff fifty thousand dollars worth of ore in sight and per cent monthly earnings guaranteed he drew out a long envelope from his pocket and cast it on the table always carry it with me said he so the burglar can t corrupt or the capitalist break in and water it i looked at the beautifully engraved certificate of stock in colorado i see said i and by the way jeff what was the name of the little man who went to denver the one you and bill met at the station alfred e ricks said jeff was the toad s designation i see said i the president of this mining company signs himself a l fredericks i was wondering let me see that stock said jeff quickly almost snatching it from me to mitigate even though slightly the embarrassment i summoned the waiter and ordered another bottle of the barbera i thought it was the least i could do a tempered wind the first time my optical nerves was disturbed by the sight of buckingham skinner was in kansas city i was standing on a corner when i see buck stick his straw colored head out of a third story window of a business block and holler whoa there whoa like you would in endeavoring to assuage a team of runaway mules i looked around but all the animals i see in sight is a policeman having his shoes shined and a couple of delivery wagons hitched to posts then in a minute downstairs tumbles this buckingham skinner and runs to the corner and stands and gazes down the other street at the imaginary dust kicked up by the fabulous hoofs of the fictitious team of chimerical quadrupeds and then b skinner goes back up to the third story room again and i see that the lettering on the window is the farmers friend loan company by and by straw top comes down again and i crossed the street to meet him for i had my ideas yes sir when i got close i could see where he overdone it he was reub all right as far as his blue jeans and cowhide boots went but he had a matinee actor s hands and the rye straw stuck over his ear looked like it belonged to the property man of the old homestead co curiosity to know what his graft was got the best of me was that your team broke away and run just now i asks him polite i tried to stop em says i but i couldn t i guess they re half way back to the farm by now gosh blame them darned mules says straw top in a voice so good that i nearly apologized they re a lus bustin loose and then he looks at me close and then he takes off his hayseed hat and says in a different voice i d like to shake hands with parleyvoo pickens the greatest street man in the west barring only montague silver which you can no more than allow i let him shake hands with me i learned under silver i said i don t begrudge him the lead but what s your graft son i admit that the phantom flight of the non existing animals at which you remarked whoa has puzzled me somewhat how do you win out on the trick buckingham skinner blushed pocket money says he that s all i am temporarily unfinanced this little coup de rye straw is good for forty dollars in a town of this size how do i work it why i involve myself as you perceive in the loathsome apparel of the rural dub thus embalmed i am jonas stubblefield a name impossible to improve upon i repair noisily to the office of some loan company conveniently located in the third floor front there i lay my hat and yarn gloves on the floor and ask to mortgage my farm for to pay for my sister s musical education in europe loans like that always suit the loan companies it s ten to one that when the note falls due the foreclosure will be leading the semiquavers by a couple of lengths well sir i reach in my pocket for the abstract of title but i suddenly hear my team running away i run to the window and emit the word or exclamation which ever it may be viz whoa then i rush down stairs and down the street returning in a few minutes dang them mules i says they done run away and busted the doubletree and two traces now i got to hoof it home for i never brought no money along reckon we ll talk about that loan some other time gen lemen then i spreads out my tarpaulin like the israelites and waits for the manna to drop why no mr stubblefield says the lobster colored party in the specs and dotted pique vest oblige us by accepting this ten dollar bill until to morrow get your harness repaired and call in at ten we ll be pleased to accommodate you in the matter of this loan it s a slight thing says buckingham skinner modest but as i said only for temporary loose change it s nothing to be ashamed of says i in respect for his mortification in case of an emergency of course it s small compared to organizing a trust or bridge whist but even the chicago university had to be started in a small way what s your graft these days buckingham skinner asks me the legitimate says i i m handling rhinestones and dr oleum sinapi s electric headache battery and the swiss warbler s bird call a small lot of the new queer ones and twos and the bonanza budget consisting of a rolled gold wedding and engagement ring six egyptian lily bulbs a combination pickle fork and nail clipper and fifty engraved visiting cards no two names alike all for the sum of cents two months ago says buckingham skinner i was doing well down in texas with a patent instantaneous fire kindler made of compressed wood ashes and benzine i sold loads of em in towns where they like to burn niggers quick without having to ask somebody for a light and just when i was doing the best they strikes oil down there and puts me out of business your machine s too slow now pardner they tells me we can have a coon in hell with this here petroleum before your old flint and tinder truck can get him warm enough to perfess religion and so i gives up the kindler and drifts up here to k c this little curtain raiser you seen me doing mr pickens with the simulated farm and the hypothetical teams ain t in my line at all and i m ashamed you found me working it no man says i kindly need to be ashamed of putting the skibunk on a loan corporation for even so small a sum as ten dollars when he is financially abashed still it wasn t quite the proper thing it s too much like borrowing money without paying it back i liked buckingham skinner from the start for as good a man as ever stood over the axles and breathed gasoline smoke and pretty soon we gets thick and i let him in on a scheme i d had in mind for some time and offers to go partners anything says buck that is not actually dishonest will find me willing and ready let us perforate into the inwardness of your proposition i feel degraded when i am forced to wear property straw in my hair and assume a bucolic air for the small sum of ten dollars actually mr pickens it makes me feel like the ophelia of the great occidental all star one night consolidated theatrical aggregation this scheme of mine was one that suited my proclivities by nature i am some sentimental and have always felt gentle toward the mollifying elements of existence i am disposed to be lenient with the arts and sciences and i find time to instigate a cordiality for the more human works of nature such as romance and the atmosphere and grass and poetry and the seasons i never skin a sucker without admiring the prismatic beauty of his scales i never sell a little auriferous beauty to the man with the hoe without noticing the beautiful harmony there is between gold and green and that s why i liked this scheme it was so full of outdoor air and landscapes and easy money we had to have a young lady assistant to help us work this graft and i asked buck if he knew of one to fill the bill one says i that is cool and wise and strictly business from her pompadour to her oxfords no ex toe dancers or gum chewers or crayon portrait canvassers for this buck claimed he knew a suitable feminine and he takes me around to see miss sarah malloy the minute i see her i am pleased she looked to be the goods as ordered no sign of the three p s about her no peroxide patchouli nor peau de soie about twenty two brown hair pleasant ways the kind of a lady for the place a description of the sandbag if you please she begins why ma am says i this graft of ours is so nice and refined and romantic it would make the balcony scene in romeo and juliet look like second story work we talked it over and miss malloy agreed to come in as a business partner she said she was glad to get a chance to give up her place as stenographer and secretary to a suburban lot company and go into something respectable this is the way we worked our scheme first i figured it out by a kind of a proverb the best grafts in the world are built up on copy book maxims and psalms and proverbs and esau s fables they seem to kind of hit off human nature our peaceful little swindle was constructed on the old saying the whole push loves a lover one evening buck and miss malloy drives up like blazes in a buggy to a farmer s door she is pale but affectionate clinging to his arm always clinging to his arm any one can see that she is a peach and of the cling variety they claim they are eloping for to be married on account of cruel parents they ask where they can find a preacher farmer says b gum there ain t any preacher nigher than reverend abels four miles over on caney creek farmeress wipes her hand on her apron and rubbers through her specs illustration she is a peach and of the cling variety then lo and look ye up the road from the other way jogs parleyvoo pickens in a gig dressed in black white necktie long face sniffing his nose emitting a spurious kind of noise resembling the long meter doxology b jinks says farmer if thar ain t a preacher now it transpires that i am rev abijah green travelling over to little bethel school house for to preach next sunday the young folks will have it they must be married for pa is pursuing them with the plow mules and the buckboard so the reverend green after hesitating marries em in the farmer s parlor and farmer grins and has in cider and says b gum and farmeress sniffles a bit and pats the bride on the shoulder and parleyvoo pickens the wrong reverend writes out a marriage certificate and farmer and farmeress sign it as witnesses and the parties of the first second and third part gets in their vehicles and rides away oh that was an idyllic graft true love and the lowing kine and the sun shining on the red barns it certainly had all other impostures i know about beat to a batter so the reverend green after hesitations marries em in the farmer s parlor i suppose i happened along in time to marry buck and miss malloy at about twenty farm houses i hated to think how the romance was going to fade later on when all them marriage certificates turned up in banks where we d discounted em and the farmers had to pay them notes of hand they d signed running from to on the th day of may us three divided about miss malloy nearly cried with joy you don t often see a tenderhearted girl or one that is bent on doing right boys says she dabbing her eyes with a little handkerchief this stake comes in handier than a powder rag at a fat men s ball it gives me a chance to reform i was trying to get out of the real estate business when you fellows came along but if you hadn t taken me in on this neat little proposition for removing the cuticle of the rutabaga propagators i m afraid i d have got into something worse i was about to accept a place in one of these women s auxiliary bazars where they build a parsonage by selling a spoonful of chicken salad and a cream puff for seventy five cents and calling it a business man s lunch now i can go into a square honest business and give all them queer jobs the shake i m going to cincinnati and start a palm reading and clairvoyant joint as madame saramaloi the egyptian sorceress i shall give everybody a dollar s worth of good honest prognostication good by boys take my advice and go into some decent fake get friendly with the police and newspapers and you ll be all right so then we all shook hands and miss malloy left us me and buck also rose up and sauntered off a few hundred miles for we didn t care to be around when them marriage certificates fell due with about between us we hit that bumptious little town off the new jersey coast they call new york if there ever was an aviary overstocked with jays it is that yaptown on the hudson cosmopolitan they call it you bet so s a piece of fly paper you listen close when they re buzzing and trying to pull their feet out of the sticky stuff little old new york s good enough for us that s what they sing there s enough reubs walk down broadway in one hour to buy up a week s output of the factory in augusta maine that makes knaughty knovelties and the little phine phun oroide gold finger ring that sticks a needle in your friend s hand you d think new york people was all wise but no they don t get a chance to learn everything s too compressed even the hayseeds are baled hayseeds but what else can you expect from a town that s shut off from the world by the ocean on one side and new jersey on the other it s no place for an honest grafter with a small capital there s too big a protective tariff on bunco even when giovanni sells a quart of warm worms and chestnut hulls he has to hand out a pint to an insectivorous cop and the hotel man charges double for everything in the bill that he sends by the patrol wagon to the altar where the duke is about to marry the heiress but old badville near coney is the ideal burg for a refined piece of piracy if you can pay the bunco duty imported grafts come pretty high the custom house officers that look after it carry clubs and it s hard to smuggle in even a bib and tucker swindle to work brooklyn with unless you can pay the toll but now me and buck having capital descends upon new york to try and trade the metropolitan backwoodsmen a few glass beads for real estate just as the vans did a hundred or two years ago at an east side hotel we gets acquainted with romulus g atterbury a man with the finest head for financial operations i ever saw it was all bald and glossy except for gray side whiskers seeing that head behind an office railing and you d deposit a million with it without a receipt this atterbury was well dressed though he ate seldom and the synopsis of his talk would make the conversation of a siren sound like a cab driver s kick he said he used to be a member of the stock exchange but some of the big capitalists got jealous and formed a ring that forced him to sell his seat atterbury got to liking me and buck and he begun to throw on the canvas for us some of the schemes that had caused his hair to evacuate he had one scheme for starting a national bank on that made the mississippi bubble look as solid as a glass marble he talked this to us for three days and when his throat was good and sore we told him about the roll we had atterbury borrowed a quarter from us and went out and got a box of throat lozenges and started all over again this time he talked bigger things and he got us to see em as he did the scheme he laid out looked like a sure winner and he talked me and buck into putting our capital against his burnished dome of thought it looked all right for a kid gloved graft it seemed to be just about an inch and a half outside of the reach of the police and as money making as a mint it was just what me and buck wanted a regular business at a permanent stand with an open air spieling with tonsilitis on the street corners every evening so in six weeks you see a handsome furnished set of offices down in the wall street neighborhood with the golconda gold bond and investment company in gilt letters on the door and you see in his private room with the door open the secretary and treasurer mr buckingham skinner costumed like the lilies of the conservatory with his high silk hat close to his hand nobody yet ever saw buck outside of an instantaneous reach for his hat and you might perceive the president and general manager mr r g atterbury with his priceless polished poll busy in the main office room dictating letters to a shorthand countess who has got pomp and a pompadour that is no less than a guarantee to investors there is a bookkeeper and an assistant and a general atmosphere of varnish and culpability at another desk the eye is relieved by the sight of an ordinary man attired with unscrupulous plainness sitting with his feet up eating apples with his obnoxious hat on the back of his head that man is no other than colonel tecumseh once parleyvoo pickens the vice president of the company no recherch rags for me i says to atterbury when we was organizing the stage properties of the robbery i m a plain man says i and i do not use pajamas french or military hair brushes cast me for the role of the rhinestone in the rough or i don t go on exhibition if you can use me in my natural though displeasing form do so dress you up says atterbury i should say not just as you are you re worth more to the business than a whole roomful of the things they pin chrysanthemums on you re to play the part of the solid but disheveled capitalist from the far west you despise the conventions you ve got so many stocks you can afford to shake socks conservative homely rough shrewd saving that s your pose it s a winner in new york keep your feet on the desk and eat apples whenever anybody comes in eat an apple let em see you stuff the peelings in a drawer of your desk look as economical and rich and rugged as you can i followed out atterbury s instructions i played the rocky mountain capitalist without ruching or frills the way i deposited apple peelings to my credit in a drawer when any customers came in made hetty green look like a spendthrift i could hear atterbury saying to victims as he smiled at me indulgent and venerating that s our vice president colonel pickens fortune in western investments delightfully plain manners but could sign his check for half a million simple as a child wonderful head conservative and careful almost to a fault atterbury managed the business me and buck never quite understood all of it though he explained it to us in full it seems the company was a kind of cooperative one and everybody that bought stock shared in the profits first we officers bought up a controlling interest we had to have that of the shares at cents a hundred just what the printer charged us and the rest went to the public at a dollar each the company guaranteed the stockholders a profit of ten per cent each month payable on the last day thereof when any stockholder had paid in as much as the company issued him a gold bond and he became a bondholder i asked atterbury one day what benefits and appurtenances these gold bonds was to an investor more so than the immunities and privileges enjoyed by the common sucker who only owned stock atterbury picked up one of them gold bonds all gilt and lettered up with flourishes and a big red seal tied with a blue ribbon in a bowknot and he looked at me like his feelings was hurt my dear colonel pickens says he you have no soul for art think of a thousand homes made happy by possessing one of these beautiful gems of the lithographer s skill think of the joy in the household where one of these gold bonds hangs by a pink cord to the what not or is chewed by the baby caroling gleefully upon the floor ah i see your eye growing moist colonel i have touched you have i not you have not says i for i ve been watching you the moisture you see is apple juice you can t expect one man to act as a human cider press and an art connoisseur too atterbury attended to the details of the concern as i understand it they was simple the investors in stock paid in their money and well i guess that s all they had to do the company received it and i don t call to mind anything else me and buck knew more about selling corn salve than we did about wall street but even we could see how the golconda gold bond investment company was making money you take in money and pay back ten per cent of it it s plain enough that you make a clean legitimate profit of per cent less expenses as long as the fish bite atterbury wanted to be president and treasurer too but buck winks an eye at him and says you was to furnish the brains do you call it good brain work when you propose to take in money at the door too think again i hereby nominate myself treasurer ad valorem sine die and by acclamation i chip in that much brain work free me and pickens we furnished the capital and we ll handle the unearned increment as it incremates it costs us for office rent and first payment on furniture more went for printing and advertising atterbury knew his business three months to a minute we ll last says he a day longer than that and we ll have to either go under or go under an alias by that time we ought to clean up and then a money belt and a lower berth for me and the yellow journals and the furniture men can pick the bones our ads done the work country weeklies and washington hand press dailies of course says i when we was ready to make contracts man says atterbury as its advertising manager you would cause a limburger cheese factory to remain undiscovered during a hot summer the game we re after is right here in new york and brooklyn and the harlem reading rooms they re the people that the street car fenders and the answers to correspondents columns and the pickpocket notices are made for we want our ads in the biggest city dailies top of column next to editorials on radium and pictures of the girl doing health exercises pretty soon the money begins to roll in buck didn t have to pretend to be busy his desk was piled high up with money orders and checks and greenbacks people began to drop in the office and buy stock every day most of the shares went in small amounts and and and a good many and lots and the bald and inviolate cranium of president atterbury shines with enthusiasm and demerit while colonel tecumseh pickens the rude but reputable croesus of the west consumes so many apples that the peelings hang to the floor from the mahogany garbage chest that he calls his desk just as atterbury said we ran along about three months without being troubled buck cashed the paper as fast as it came in and kept the money in a safe deposit vault a block or so away buck never thought much of banks for such purposes we paid the interest regular on the stock we d sold so there was nothing for anybody to squeal about we had nearly on hand and all three of us had been living as high as prize fighters out of training one morning as me and buck sauntered into the office fat and flippant from our noon grub we met an easy looking fellow with a bright eye and a pipe in his mouth coming out we found atterbury looking like he d been caught a mile from home in a wet shower know that man he asked us we said we didn t i don t either says atterbury wiping off his head but i ll bet enough gold bonds to paper a cell in the tombs that he s a newspaper reporter what did he want asks buck information says our president said he was thinking of buying some stock he asked me about nine hundred questions and every one of em hit some sore place in the business i know he s on a paper you can t fool me you see a man about half shabby with an eye like a gimlet smoking cut plug with dandruff on his coat collar and knowing more than j p morgan and shakespeare put together if that ain t a reporter i never saw one i was afraid of this i don t mind detectives and post office inspectors i talk to em eight minutes and then sell em stock but them reporters take the starch out of my collar boys i recommend that we declare a dividend and fade away the signs point that way me and buck talked to atterbury and got him to stop sweating and stand still that fellow didn t look like a reporter to us reporters always pull out a pencil and tablet on you and tell you a story you ve heard and strikes you for the drinks but atterbury was shaky and nervous all day the next day me and buck comes down from the hotel about ten thirty on the way we buys the papers and the first thing we see is a column on the front page about our little imposition it was a shame the way that reporter intimated that we were no blood relatives of the late george w childs he tells all about the scheme as he sees it in a rich racy kind of a guying style that might amuse most anybody except a stockholder yes atterbury was right it behooveth the gaily clad treasurer and the pearly pated president and the rugged vice president of the golconda gold bond and investment company to go away real sudden and quick that their days might be longer upon the land me and buck hurries down to the office we finds on the stairs and in the hall a crowd of people trying to squeeze into our office which is already jammed full inside to the railing they ve nearly all got golconda stock and gold bonds in their hands me and buck judged they d been reading the papers too we stopped and looked at our stockholders some surprised it wasn t quite the kind of a gang we supposed had been investing they all looked like poor people there was plenty of old women and lots of young girls that you d say worked in factories and mills some was old men that looked like war veterans and some was crippled and a good many was just kids bootblacks and newsboys and messengers some was working men in overalls with their sleeves rolled up not one of the gang looked like a stockholder in anything unless it was a peanut stand but they all had golconda stock and looked as sick as you please i saw a queer kind of a pale look come on buck s face when he sized up the crowd he stepped up to a sickly looking woman and says madam do you own any of this stock i put in a hundred dollars says the woman faint like it was all i had saved in a year one of my children is dying at home now and i haven t a cent in the house i came to see if i could draw out some the circulars said you could draw it at any time but they say now i will lose it all there was a smart kind of kid in the gang i guess he was a newsboy i got in twenty fi mister he says looking hopeful at buck s silk hat and clothes dey paid me two fifty a mont on it say a man tells me dey can t do dat and be on de square is dat straight do you guess i can get out my twenty fi some of the old women was crying the factory girls was plumb distracted they d lost all their savings and they d be docked for the time they lost coming to see about it there was one girl a pretty one in a red shawl crying in a corner like her heart would dissolve buck goes over and asks her about it it ain t so much losing the money mister says she shaking all over though i ve been two years saving it up but jakey won t marry me now he ll take rosa steinfeld i know j j jakey she s got in the savings bank ai ai ai she sings out buck looks all around with that same funny look on his face and then we see leaning against the wall puffing at his pipe with his eye shining at us this newspaper reporter buck and me walks over to him you re a real interesting writer says buck how far do you mean to carry it anything more up your sleeve oh i m just waiting around says the reporter smoking away in case any news turns up it s up to your stockholders now some of them might complain you know isn t that the patrol wagon now he says listening to a sound outside no he goes on that s doc whittleford s old cadaver coup from the roosevelt i ought to know that gong yes i suppose i ve written some interesting stuff at times you wait says buck i m going to throw an item of news in your way buck reaches in his pocket and hands me a key i knew what he meant before he spoke confounded old buccaneer i knew what he meant they don t make them any better than buck pick says he looking at me hard ain t this graft a little out of our line do we want jakey to marry rosa steinfeld you ve got my vote says i i ll have it here in ten minutes and i starts for the safe deposit vaults i comes back with the money done up in a big bundle and then buck and me takes the journalist reporter around to another door and we let ourselves into one of the office rooms now my literary friend says buck take a chair and keep still and i ll give you an interview you see before you two grafters from graftersville grafter county arkansas me and pick have sold brass jewelry hair tonic song books marked cards patent medicines connecticut smyrna rugs furniture polish and albums in every town from old point comfort to the golden gate we ve grafted a dollar whenever we saw one that had a surplus look to it but we never went after the simoleon in the toe of the sock under the loose brick in the corner of the kitchen hearth there s an old saying you may have heard fussily decency averni which means it s an easy slide from the street faker s dry goods box to a desk in wall street we ve took that slide but we didn t know exactly what was at the bottom of it now you ought to be wise but you ain t you ve got new york wiseness which means that you judge a man by the outside of his clothes that ain t right you ought to look at the lining and seams and the button holes while we are waiting for the patrol wagon you might get out your little stub pencil and take notes for another funny piece in the paper and then buck turns to me and says i don t care what atterbury thinks he only put in brains and if he gets his capital out he s lucky but what do you say pick me says i you ought to know me buck i didn t know who was buying the stock all right says buck and then he goes through the inside door into the main office and looks at the gang trying to squeeze through the railing atterbury and his hat was gone and buck makes em a short speech all you lambs get in line you re going to get your wool back don t shove so get in a line a line not in a pile lady will you please stop bleating your money s waiting for you here sonny don t climb over that railing your dimes are safe don t cry sis you ain t out a cent get in line i say here pick come and straighten em out and let em through and out by the other door buck takes off his coat pushes his silk hat on the back of his head and lights up a reina victoria he sets at the table with the boodle before him all done up in neat packages i gets the stockholders strung out and marches em single file through from the main room and the reporter man passes em out of the side door into the hall again as they go by buck takes up the stock and the gold bonds paying em cash dollar for dollar the same as they paid in the shareholders of the golconda gold bond and investment company can t hardly believe it they almost grabs the money out of buck s hands some of the women keep on crying for it s a custom of the sex to cry when they have sorrow to weep when they have joy and to shed tears whenever they find themselves without either the old women s fingers shake when they stuff the skads in the bosom of their rusty dresses the factory girls just stoop over and flap their dry goods a second and you hear the elastic go pop as the currency goes down in the ladies department of the old domestic lisle thread bank some of the stockholders that had been doing the jeremiah act the loudest outside had spasms of restored confidence and wanted to leave the money invested salt away that chicken feed in your duds and skip along says buck what business have you got investing in bonds the tea pot or the crack in the wall behind the clock for your hoard of pennies when the pretty girl in the red shawl cashes in buck hands her an extra twenty a wedding present says our treasurer from the golconda company and say if jakey ever follows his nose even at a respectful distance around the corner where rosa steinfeld lives you are hereby authorized to knock a couple of inches of it off when they was all paid off and gone buck calls the newspaper reporter and shoves the rest of the money over to him you begun this says buck now finish it over there are the books showing every share

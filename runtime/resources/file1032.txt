seeders was thin and had light hair and appeared to have been recently rough dried and starched he was too diffident to aspire to aileen s notice so he usually sat at one of tildy s tables where he devoted himself to silence and boiled weakfish one day when mr seeders came in to dinner he had been drinking beer there were only two or three customers in the restaurant when mr seeders had finished his weakfish he got up put his arm around tildy s waist kissed her loudly and impudently walked out upon the street snapped his fingers in the direction of the laundry and hied himself to play pennies in the slot machines at the amusement arcade for a few moments tildy stood petrified then she was aware of aileen shaking at her an arch forefinger and saying why til you naughty girl ain t you getting to be awful miss slyboots first thing i know you ll be stealing some of my fellows i must keep an eye on you my lady another thing dawned upon tildy s recovering wits in a moment she had advanced from a hopeless lowly admirer to be an eve sister of the potent aileen she herself was now a man charmer a mark for cupid a sabine who must be coy when the romans were at their banquet boards man had found her waist achievable and her lips desirable the sudden and amatory seeders had as it were performed for her a miraculous piece of one day laundry work he had taken the sackcloth of her uncomeliness had washed dried starched and ironed it and returned it to her sheer embroidered lawn the robe of venus herself the freckles on tildy s cheeks merged into a rosy flush now both circe and psyche peeped from her brightened eyes not even aileen herself had been publicly embraced and kissed in the restaurant tildy could not keep the delightful secret when trade was slack she went and stood at bogle s desk her eyes were shining she tried not to let her words sound proud and boastful a gentleman insulted me to day she said he hugged me around the waist and kissed me that so said bogle cracking open his business armour after this week you get a dollar a week more at the next regular meal when tildy set food before customers with whom she had acquaintance she said to each of them modestly as one whose merit needed no bolstering a gentleman insulted me to day in the restaurant he put his arm around my waist and kissed me the diners accepted the revelation in various ways some incredulously some with congratulations others turned upon her the stream of badinage that had hitherto been directed at aileen alone and tildy s heart swelled in her bosom for she saw at last the towers of romance rise above the horizon of the grey plain in which she had for so long travelled for two days mr seeders came not again during that time tildy established herself firmly as a woman to be wooed she bought ribbons and arranged her hair like aileen s and tightened her waist two inches she had a thrilling but delightful fear that mr seeders would rush in suddenly and shoot her with a pistol he must have loved her desperately and impulsive lovers are always blindly jealous even aileen had not been shot at with a pistol and then tildy rather hoped that he would not shoot at her for she was always loyal to aileen and she did not want to overshadow her friend at o clock on the afternoon of the third day mr seeders came in there were no customers at the tables at the back end of the restaurant tildy was refilling the mustard pots and aileen was quartering pies mr seeders walked back to where they stood tildy looked up and saw him gasped and pressed the mustard spoon against her heart a red hair bow was in her hair she wore venus s eighth avenue badge the blue bead necklace with the swinging silver symbolic heart mr seeders was flushed and embarrassed he plunged one hand into his hip pocket and the other into a fresh pumpkin pie miss tildy said he i want to apologise for what i done the other evenin tell you the truth i was pretty well tanked up or i wouldn t of done it i wouldn t do no lady that a way when i was sober so i hope miss tildy you ll accept my pology and believe that i wouldn t of done it if i d known what i was doin and hadn t of been drunk with this handsome plea mr seeders backed away and departed feeling that reparation had been made but behind the convenient screen tildy had thrown herself flat upon a table among the butter chips and the coffee cups and was sobbing her heart out out and back again to the grey plain wherein travel they with blunt noses and hay coloured hair from her knot she had torn the red hair bow and cast it upon the floor seeders she despised utterly she had but taken his kiss as that of a pioneer and prophetic prince who might have set the clocks going and the pages to running in fairyland but the kiss had been maudlin and unmeant the court had not stirred at the false alarm she must forevermore remain the sleeping beauty yet not all was lost aileen s arm was around her and tildy s red hand groped among the butter chips till it found the warm clasp of her friend s don t you fret til said aileen who did not understand entirely that turnip faced little clothespin of a seeders ain t worth it he ain t anything of a gentleman or he wouldn t ever of apologised the gentle grafter the octopus marooned a trust is its weakest point said jeff peters that said i sounds like one of those unintelligible remarks such as why is a policeman it is not said jeff there are no relations between a trust and a policeman my remark was an epitogram an axis a kind of mulct em in parvo what it means is that a trust is like an egg and it is not like an egg if you want to break an egg you have to do it from the outside the only way to break up a trust is from the inside keep sitting on it until it hatches look at the brood of young colleges and libraries that s chirping and peeping all over the country yes sir every trust bears in its own bosom the seeds of its destruction like a rooster that crows near a georgia colored methodist camp meeting or a republican announcing himself a candidate for governor of texas i asked jeff jestingly if he had ever during his checkered plaided mottled pied and dappled career conducted an enterprise of the class to which the word trust had been applied somewhat to my surprise he acknowledged the corner once said he and the state seal of new jersey never bit into a charter that opened up a solider and safer piece of legitimate octopusing we had everything in our favor wind water police nerve and a clean monopoly of an article indispensable to the public there wasn t a trust buster on the globe that could have found a weak spot in our scheme it made rockefeller s little kerosene speculation look like a bucket shop but we lost out some unforeseen opposition came up i suppose i said no sir it was just as i said we were self curbed it was a case of auto suppression there was a rift within the loot as albert tennyson says you remember i told you that me and andy tucker was partners for some years that man was the most talented conniver at stratagems i ever saw whenever he saw a dollar in another man s hands he took it as a personal grudge if he couldn t take it any other way andy was educated too besides having a lot of useful information he had acquired a big amount of experience out of books and could talk for hours on any subject connected with ideas and discourse he had been in every line of graft from lecturing on palestine with a lot of magic lantern pictures of the annual custom made clothiers association convention at atlantic city to flooding connecticut with bogus wood alcohol distilled from nutmegs one spring me and andy had been over in mexico on a flying trip during which a philadelphia capitalist had paid us for a half interest in a silver mine in chihuahua oh yes the mine was all right the other half interest must have been worth two or three thousand i often wondered who owned that mine in coming back to the united states me and andy stubbed our toes against a little town in texas on the bank of the rio grande the name of it was bird city but it wasn t the town had about inhabitants mostly men i figured out that their principal means of existence was in living close to tall chaparral some of em were stockmen and some gamblers and some horse peculators and plenty were in the smuggling line me and andy put up at a hotel that was built like something between a roof garden and a sectional bookcase it began to rain the day we got there as the saying is juniper aquarius was sure turning on the water plugs on mount amphibious now there were three saloons in bird city though neither andy nor me drank but we could see the townspeople making a triangular procession from one to another all day and half the night everybody seemed to know what to do with as much money as they had the third day of the rain it slacked up awhile in the afternoon so me and andy walked out to the edge of town to view the mudscape bird city was built between the rio grande and a deep wide arroyo that used to be the old bed of the river the bank between the stream and its old bed was cracking and giving away when we saw it on account of the high water caused by the rain andy looks at it a long time that man s intellects was never idle and then he unfolds to me a instantaneous idea that has occurred to him right there was organized a trust and we walked back into town and put it on the market first we went to the main saloon in bird city called the blue snake and bought it it cost us and then we dropped in casual at mexican joe s place referred to the rain and bought him out for the other one came easy at the next morning bird city woke up and found itself an island the river had busted through its old channel and the town was surrounded by roaring torrents the rain was still raining and there was heavy clouds in the northwest that presaged about six more mean annual rainfalls during the next two weeks but the worst was yet to come bird city hopped out of its nest waggled its pin feathers and strolled out for its matutinal toot lo mexican joe s place was closed and likewise the other little dobe life saving station so naturally the body politic emits thirsty ejaculations of surprise and ports hellum for the blue snake and what does it find there behind one end of the bar sits jefferson peters octopus with a sixshooter on each side of him ready to make change or corpses as the case may be there are three bartenders and on the wall is a ten foot sign reading all drinks one dollar andy sits on the safe in his neat blue suit and gold banded cigar on the lookout for emergencies the town marshal is there with two deputies to keep order having been promised free drinks by the trust well sir it took bird city just ten minutes to realize that it was in a cage we expected trouble but there wasn t any the citizens saw that we had em the nearest railroad was thirty miles away and it would be two weeks at least before the river would be fordable so they began to cuss amiable and throw down dollars on the bar till it sounded like a selection on the xylophone there was about grown up adults in bird city that had arrived at years of indiscretion and the majority of em required from three to twenty drinks a day to make life endurable the blue snake was the only place where they could get em till the flood subsided it was beautiful and simple as all truly great swindles are about ten o clock the silver dollars dropping on the bar slowed down to playing two steps and marches instead of jigs but i looked out the window and saw a hundred or two of our customers standing in line at bird city savings and loan co and i knew they were borrowing more money to be sucked in by the clammy tendrils of the octopus at the fashionable hour of noon everybody went home to dinner we told the bartenders to take advantage of the lull and do the same then me and andy counted the receipts we had taken in we calculated that if bird city would only remain an island for two weeks the trust would be able to endow the chicago university with a new dormitory of padded cells for the faculty and present every worthy poor man in texas with a farm provided he furnished the site for it andy was especial inroaded by self esteem at our success the rudiments of the scheme having originated in his own surmises and premonitions he got off the safe and lit the biggest cigar in the house jeff says he i don t suppose that anywhere in the world you could find three cormorants with brighter ideas about down treading the proletariat than the firm of peters satan and tucker incorporated we have sure handed the small consumer a giant blow in the sole apoplectic region no well says i it does look as if we would have to take up gastritis and golf or be measured for kilts in spite of ourselves this little turn in bug juice is verily all to the skibo and i can stand it says i i d rather batten than bant any day andy pours himself out four fingers of our best rye and does with it as was so intended it was the first drink i had ever known him to take by way of liberation says he to the gods and then after thus doing umbrage to the heathen diabetes he drinks another to our success and then he begins to toast the trade beginning with raisuli and the northern pacific and on down the line to the little ones like the school book combine and the oleomargarine outrages and the lehigh valley and great scott coal federation it s all right andy says i to drink the health of our brother monopolists but don t overdo the wassail you know our most eminent and loathed multi corruptionists live on weak tea and dog biscuits andy went in the back room awhile and came out dressed in his best clothes there was a kind of murderous and soulful look of gentle riotousness in his eye that i didn t like i watched him to see what turn the whiskey was going to take in him there are two times when you never can tell what is going to happen one is when a man takes his first drink and the other is when a woman takes her latest in less than an hour andy s skate had turned to an ice yacht he was outwardly decent and managed to preserve his aquarium but inside he was impromptu and full of unexpectedness jeff says he do you know that i m a crater a living crater that s a self evident hypothesis says i but you re not irish why don t you say creature according to the rules and syntax of america i m the crater of a volcano says he i m all aflame and crammed inside with an assortment of words and phrases that have got to have an exodus i can feel millions of synonyms and parts of speech rising in me says he and i ve got to make a speech of some sort drink says andy always drives me to oratory it could do no worse says i from my earliest recollections says he alcohol seemed to stimulate my sense of recitation and rhetoric why in bryan s second campaign says andy they used to give me three gin rickeys and i d speak two hours longer than billy himself could on the silver question finally they persuaded me to take the gold cure if you ve got to get rid of your excess verbiage says i why not go out on the river bank and speak a piece it seems to me there was an old spell binder named cantharides that used to go and disincorporate himself of his windy numbers along the seashore no says andy i must have an audience i feel like if i once turned loose people would begin to call senator beveridge the grand young sphinx of the wabash i ve got to get an audience together jeff and get this oral distension assuaged or it may turn in on me and i d go about feeling like a deckle edge edition de luxe of mrs e d e n southworth on what special subject of the theorems and topics does your desire for vocality seem to be connected with i asks i ain t particular says andy i am equally good and varicose on all subjects i can take up the matter of russian immigration or the poetry of john w keats or the tariff or kabyle literature or drainage and make my audience weep cry sob and shed tears by turns well andy says i if you are bound to get rid of this accumulation of vernacular suppose you go out in town and work it on some indulgent citizen me and the boys will take care of the business everybody will be through dinner pretty soon and salt pork and beans makes a man pretty thirsty we ought to take in more by midnight so andy goes out of the blue snake and i see him stopping men on the street and talking to em by and by he has half a dozen in a bunch listening to him and pretty soon i see him waving his arms and elocuting at a good sized crowd on a corner when he walks away they string out after him talking all the time and he leads em down the main street of bird city with more men joining the procession as they go it reminded me of the old legerdemain that i d read in books about the pied piper of heidsieck charming the children away from the town one o clock came and then two and three got under the wire for place and not a bird citizen came in for a drink the streets were deserted except for some ducks and ladies going to the stores there was only a light drizzle falling then a lonesome man came along and stopped in front of the blue snake to scrape the mud off his boots pardner says i what has happened this morning there was hectic gaiety afoot and now it seems more like one of them ruined cities of tyre and siphon where the lone lizard crawls on the walls of the main port cullis the whole town says the muddy man is up in sperry s wool warehouse listening to your side kicker make a speech he is some gravy on delivering himself of audible sounds relating to matters and conclusions says the man well i hope he ll adjourn sine qua non pretty soon says i for trade languishes not a customer did we have that afternoon at six o clock two mexicans brought andy to the saloon lying across the back of a burro we put him in bed while he still muttered and gesticulated with his hands and feet then i locked up the cash and went out to see what had happened i met a man who told me all about it andy had made the finest two hour speech that had ever been heard in texas he said or anywhere else in the world what was it about i asked temperance says he and when he got through every man in bird city signed the pledge for a year jeff peters as a personal magnet jeff peters has been engaged in as many schemes for making money as there are recipes for cooking rice in charleston s c best of all i like to hear him tell of his earlier days when he sold liniments and cough cures on street corners living hand to mouth heart to heart with the people throwing heads or tails with fortune for his last coin i struck fisher hill arkansaw said he in a buckskin suit moccasins long hair and a thirty carat diamond ring that i got from an actor in texarkana i don t know what he ever did with the pocket knife i swapped him for it i was dr waugh hoo the celebrated indian medicine man i carried only one best bet just then and that was resurrection bitters it was made of life giving plants and herbs accidentally discovered by ta qua la the beautiful wife of the chief of the choctaw nation while gathering truck to garnish a platter of boiled dog for the annual corn dance business hadn t been good in the last town so i only had five dollars i went to the fisher hill druggist and he credited me for half a gross of eight ounce bottles and corks i had the labels and ingredients in my valise left over from the last town life began to look rosy again after i got in my hotel room with the water running from the tap and the resurrection bitters lining up on the table by the dozen fake no sir there was two dollars worth of fluid extract of cinchona and a dime s worth of aniline in that half gross of bitters i ve gone through towns years afterwards and had folks ask for em again i hired a wagon that night and commenced selling the bitters on main street fisher hill was a low malarial town and a compound hypothetical pneumocardiac anti scorbutic tonic was just what i diagnosed the crowd as needing the bitters started off like sweetbreads on toast at a vegetarian dinner i had sold two dozen at fifty cents apiece when i felt somebody pull my coat tail i knew what that meant so i climbed down and sneaked a five dollar bill into the hand of a man with a german silver star on his lapel constable says i it s a fine night have you got a city license he asks to sell this illegitimate essence of spooju that you flatter by the name of medicine i have not says i i didn t know you had a city if i can find it to morrow i ll take one out if it s necessary i ll have to close you up till you do says the constable i quit selling and went back to the hotel i was talking to the landlord about it oh you won t stand no show in fisher hill says he dr hoskins the only doctor here is a brother in law of the mayor and they won t allow no fake doctor to practice in town i don t practice medicine says i i ve got a state peddler s license and i take out a city one wherever they demand it i went to the mayor s office the next morning and they told me he hadn t showed up yet they didn t know when he d be down so doc waugh hoo hunches down again in a hotel chair and lights a jimpson weed regalia and waits by and by a young man in a blue necktie slips into the chair next to me and asks the time half past ten says i and you are andy tucker i ve seen you work wasn t it you that put up the great cupid combination package on the southern states let s see it was a chilian diamond engagement ring a wedding ring a potato masher a bottle of soothing syrup and dorothy vernon all for fifty cents andy was pleased to hear that i remembered him he was a good street man and he was more than that he respected his profession and he was satisfied with per cent profit he had plenty of offers to go into the illegitimate drug and garden seed business but he was never to be tempted off of the straight path i wanted a partner so andy and me agreed to go out together i told him about the situation in fisher hill and how finances was low on account of the local mixture of politics and jalap andy had just got in on the train that morning he was pretty low himself and was going to canvass the whole town for a few dollars to build a new battleship by popular subscription at eureka springs so we went out and sat on the porch and talked it over the next morning at eleven o clock when i was sitting there alone an uncle tom shuffles into the hotel and asked for the doctor to come and see judge banks who it seems was the mayor and a mighty sick man i m no doctor says i why don t you go and get the doctor boss says he doc hoskins am done gone twenty miles in de country to see some sick persons he s de only doctor in de town and massa banks am powerful bad off he sent me to ax you to please suh come as man to man says i i ll go and look him over so i put a bottle of resurrection bitters in my pocket and goes up on the hill to the mayor s mansion the finest house in town with a mansard roof and two cast iron dogs on the lawn this mayor banks was in bed all but his whiskers and feet he was making internal noises that would have had everybody in san francisco hiking for the parks a young man was standing by the bed holding a cup of water doc says the mayor i m awful sick i m about to die can t you do nothing for me mr mayor says i i m not a regular preordained disciple of s q lapius i never took a course in a medical college says i i ve just come as a fellow man to see if i could be off assistance i m deeply obliged says he doc waugh hoo this is my nephew mr biddle he has tried to alleviate my distress but without success oh lordy ow ow ow he sings out i nods at mr biddle and sets down by the bed and feels the mayor s pulse let me see your liver your tongue i mean says i then i turns up the lids of his eyes and looks close that the pupils of em how long have you been sick i asked i was taken down ow ouch last night says the mayor gimme something for it doc won t you mr fiddle says i raise the window shade a bit will you biddle says the young man do you feel like you could eat some ham and eggs uncle james mr mayor says i after laying my ear to his right shoulder blade and listening you ve got a bad attack of super inflammation of the right clavicle of the harpsichord good lord says he with a groan can t you rub something on it or set it or anything i picks up my hat and starts for the door you ain t going doc says the mayor with a howl you ain t going away and leave me to die with this superfluity of the clapboards are you common humanity dr whoa ha says mr biddle ought to prevent your deserting a fellow human in distress dr waugh hoo when you get through plowing says i and then i walks back to the bed and throws back my long hair mr mayor says i there is only one hope for you drugs will do you no good but there is another power higher yet although drugs are high enough says i and what is that says he scientific demonstrations says i the triumph of mind over sarsaparilla the belief that there is no pain and sickness except what is produced when we ain t feeling well declare yourself in arrears demonstrate what is this paraphernalia you speak of doc says the mayor you ain t a socialist are you i am speaking says i of the great doctrine of psychic financiering of the enlightened school of long distance sub conscientious treatment of fallacies and meningitis of that wonderful in door sport known as personal magnetism can you work it doc asks the mayor i m one of the sole sanhedrims and ostensible hooplas of the inner pulpit says i the lame talk and the blind rubber whenever i make a pass at em i am a medium a coloratura hypnotist and a spirituous control it was only through me at the recent seances at ann arbor that the late president of the vinegar bitters company could revisit the earth to communicate with his sister jane you see me peddling medicine on the street says i to the poor i don t practice personal magnetism on them i do not drag it in the dust says i because they haven t got the dust will you treat my case asks the mayor listen says i i ve had a good deal of trouble with medical societies everywhere i ve been i don t practice medicine but to save your life i ll give you the psychic treatment if you ll agree as mayor not to push the license question of course i will says he and now get to work doc for them pains are coming on again my fee will be cure guaranteed in two treatments says i all right says the mayor i ll pay it i guess my life s worth that much i sat down by the bed and looked him straight in the eye now says i get your mind off the disease you ain t sick you haven t got a heart or a clavicle or a funny bone or brains or anything you haven t got any pain declare error now you feel the pain that you didn t have leaving don t you i do feel some little better doc says the mayor darned if i don t now state a few lies about my not having this swelling in my left side and i think i could be propped up and have some sausage and buckwheat cakes i made a few passes with my hands now says i the inflammation s gone the right lobe of the perihelion has subsided you re getting sleepy you can t hold your eyes open any longer for the present the disease is checked now you are asleep the mayor shut his eyes slowly and began to snore you observe mr tiddle says i the wonders of modern science biddle says he when will you give uncle the rest of the treatment dr pooh pooh waugh hoo says i i ll come back at eleven to morrow when he wakes up give him eight drops of turpentine and three pounds of steak good morning the next morning i was back on time well mr riddle says i when he opened the bedroom door and how is uncle this morning he seems much better says the young man the mayor s color and pulse was fine i gave him another treatment and he said the last of the pain left him now says i you d better stay in bed for a day or two and you ll be all right it s a good thing i happened to be in fisher hill mr mayor says i for all the remedies in the cornucopia that the regular schools of medicine use couldn t have saved you and now that error has flew and pain proved a perjurer let s allude to a cheerfuller subject say the fee of no checks please i hate to write my name on the back of a check almost as bad as i do on the front i ve got the cash here says the mayor pulling a pocket book from under his pillow he counts out five fifty dollar notes and holds em in his hand bring the receipt he says to biddle i signed the receipt and the mayor handed me the money i put it in my inside pocket careful now do your duty officer says the mayor grinning much unlike a sick man mr biddle lays his hand on my arm you re under arrest dr waugh hoo alias peters says he for practising medicine without authority under the state law who are you i asks i ll tell you who he is says mr mayor sitting up in bed he s a detective employed by the state medical society he s been following you over five counties he came to me yesterday and we fixed up this scheme to catch you i guess you won t do any more doctoring around these parts mr fakir what was it you said i had doc the mayor laughs compound well it wasn t softening of the brain i guess anyway a detective says i correct says biddle i ll have to turn you over to the sheriff let s see you do it says i and i grabs biddle by the throat and half throws him out the window but he pulls a gun and sticks it under my chin and i stand still then he puts handcuffs on me and takes the money out of my pocket i witness says he that they re the same bank bills that you and i marked judge banks i ll turn them over to the sheriff when we get to his office and he ll send you a receipt they ll have to be used as evidence in the case all right mr biddle says the mayor and now doc waugh hoo he goes on why don t you demonstrate can t you pull the cork out of your magnetism with your teeth and hocus pocus them handcuffs off come on officer says i dignified i may as well make the best of it and then i turns to old banks and rattles my chains mr mayor says i the time will come soon when you ll believe that personal magnetism is a success and you ll be sure that it succeeded in this case too and i guess it did when we got nearly to the gate i says we might meet somebody now andy i reckon you better take em off and hey why of course it was andy tucker that was his scheme and that s how we got the capital to go into business together modern rural sports jeff peters must be reminded whenever he is called upon pointedly for a story he will maintain that his life has been as devoid of incident as the longest of trollope s novels but lured he will divulge therefore i cast many and divers flies upon the current of his thoughts before i feel a nibble i notice said i that the western farmers in spite of their prosperity are running after their old populistic idols again it s the running season said jeff for farmers shad maple trees and the connemaugh river i know something about farmers i thought i struck one once that had got out of the rut but andy tucker proved to me i was mistaken once a farmer always a sucker said andy he s the man that s shoved into the front row among bullets ballots and the ballet he s the funny bone and gristle of the country said andy and i don t know who we would do without him one morning me and andy wakes up with sixty eight cents between us in a yellow pine hotel on the edge of the pre digested hoe cake belt of southern indiana how we got off the train there the night before i can t tell you for she went through the village so fast that what looked like a saloon to us through the car window turned out to be a composite view of a drug store and a water tank two blocks apart why we got off at the first station we could belongs to a little oroide gold watch and alaska diamond deal we failed to pull off the day before over the kentucky line when i woke up i heard roosters crowing and smelt something like the fumes of nitro muriatic acid and heard something heavy fall on the floor below us and a man swearing cheer up andy says i we re in a rural community somebody has just tested a gold brick downstairs we ll go out and get what s coming to us from a farmer and then yoicks and away farmers was always a kind of reserve fund to me whenever i was in hard luck i d go to the crossroads hook a finger in a farmer s suspender recite the prospectus of my swindle in a mechanical kind of a way look over what he had give him back his keys whetstone and papers that was of no value except to owner and stroll away without asking any questions farmers are not fair game to me as high up in our business as me and andy was but there was times when we found em useful just as wall street does the secretary of the treasury now and then when we went down stairs we saw we was in the midst of the finest farming section we ever see about two miles away on a hill was a big white house in a grove surrounded by a wide spread agricultural agglomeration of fields and barns and pastures and out houses whose house is that we asked the landlord that says he is the domicile and the arboreal terrestrial and horticultural accessories of farmer ezra plunkett one of our county s most progressive citizens after breakfast me and andy with eight cents capital left casts the horoscope of the rural potentate let me go alone says i two of us against one farmer would look as one sided as roosevelt using both hands to kill a grizzly all right says andy i like to be a true sport even when i m only collecting rebates from the rutabag raisers what bait are you going to use for this ezra thing andy asks me oh i says the first thing that come to hand in the suit case i reckon i ll take along some of the new income tax receipts and the recipe for making clover honey out of clabber and apple peelings and the order blanks for the mcguffey s readers which afterwards turn out to be mccormick s reapers and the pearl necklace found on the train and a pocket size goldbrick and a that ll be enough says andy any one of the lot ought to land on ezra and say jeff make that succotash fancier give you nice clean new bills it s a disgrace to our department of agriculture civil service and pure food law the kind of stuff some of these farmers hand out to use i ve had to take rolls from em that looked like bundles of microbe cultures captured out of a red cross ambulance so i goes to a livery stable and hires a buggy on my looks i drove out to the plunkett farm and hitched there was a man sitting on the front steps of the house he had on a white flannel suit a diamond ring golf cap and a pink ascot tie summer boarder says i to myself i d like to see farmer ezra plunkett says i to him you see him says he what seems to be on your mind i never answered a word i stood still repeating to myself the rollicking lines of that merry jingle the man with the hoe when i looked at this farmer the little devices i had in my pocket for buncoing the pushed back brows seemed as hopeless as trying to shake down the beef trust with a mittimus and a parlor rifle well says he looking at me close speak up i see the left pocket of your coat sags a good deal out with the goldbrick first i m rather more interested in the bricks than i am in the trick sixty day notes and the lost silver mine story i had a kind of cerebral sensation of foolishness in my ideas of ratiocination but i pulled out the little brick and unwrapped my handkerchief off it one dollar and eighty cents says the farmer hefting it in his hand is it a trade the lead in it is worth more than that says i dignified i put it back in my pocket all right says he but i sort of wanted it for the collection i m starting i got a one last week for just then a telephone bell rings in the house come in bunk says the farmer and look at my place it s kind of lonesome here sometimes i think that s new york calling we went inside the room looked like a broadway stockbroker s light oak desks two phones spanish leather upholstered chairs and couches oil paintings in gilt frames a foot deep and a ticker hitting off the news in one corner hello hello says this funny farmer is that the regent theatre yes this is plunkett of woodbine centre reserve four orchestra seats for friday evening my usual ones yes friday good bye i run over to new york every two weeks to see a show says the farmer hanging up the receiver i catch the eighteen hour flyer at indianapolis spend ten hours in the heyday of night on the yappian way and get home in time to see the chickens go to roost forty eight hours later oh the pristine hubbard squasherino of the cave dwelling period is getting geared up some for the annual meeting of the don t blow out the gas association don t you think mr bunk i seem to perceive says i a kind of hiatus in the agrarian traditions in which heretofore i have reposed confidence sure bunk says he the yellow primrose on the river s brim is getting to look to us reubs like a holiday edition de luxe of the language of flowers with deckle edges and frontispiece just then the telephone calls him again hello hello says he oh that s perkins at milldale i told you was too much for that horse have you got him there good let me see him get away from the transmitter now make him trot in a circle faster yes i can hear him keep on faster yet that ll do now lead him up to the phone closer get his nose nearer there now wait no i don t want that horse what no not at any price he interferes and he s windbroken goodbye now bunk says the farmer do you begin to realize that agriculture has had a hair cut you belong in a bygone era why tom lawson himself knows better than to try to catch an up to date agriculturalist napping it s saturday the fourteenth on the farm you bet now look here and see how we keep up with the day s doings he shows me a machine on a table with two things for your ears like the penny in the slot affairs i puts it on and listens a female voice starts up reading headlines of murders accidents and other political casualities what you hear says the farmer is a synopsis of to day s news in the new york chicago st louis and san francisco papers it is wired in to our rural news bureau and served hot to subscribers on this table you see the principal dailies and weeklies of the country also a special service of advance sheets of the monthly magazines i picks up one sheet and sees that it s headed special advance proofs in july the century will say and so forth the farmer rings up somebody his manager i reckon and tells him to let that herd of jerseys go at a head and to sow the acre field in wheat and to have extra cans ready at the station for the milk trolley car then he passes the henry clays and sets out a bottle of green chartreuse and goes over and looks at the ticker tape consolidated gas up two points says he oh very well ever monkey with copper i asks stand back says he raising his hand or i ll call the dog i told you not to waste your time after a while he says bunk if you don t mind my telling you your company begins to cloy slightly i ve got to write an article on the chimera of communism for a magazine and attend a meeting of the race track association this afternoon of course you understand by now that you can t get my proxy for your remedy whatever it may be well sir all i could think of to do was to go out and get in the buggy the horse turned round and took me back to the hotel i hitched him and went in to see andy in his room i told him about this farmer word for word and i sat picking at the table cover like one bereft of sagaciousness i don t understand it says i humming a sad and foolish little song to cover my humiliation andy walks up and down the room for a long time biting the left end of his mustache as he does when in the act of thinking jeff says he finally i believe your story of this expurgated rustic but i am not convinced it looks incredulous to me that he could have inoculated himself against all the preordained systems of bucolic bunco now you never regarded me as a man of special religious proclivities did you jeff says andy well says i no but says i not to wound his feelings i have also observed many church members whose said proclivities were not so outwardly developed that they would show on a white handkerchief if you rubbed em with it i have always been a deep student of nature from creation down says andy and i believe in an ultimatum design of providence farmers was made for a purpose and that was to furnish a livelihood to men like me and you else why was we given brains it is my belief that the manna that the israelites lived on for forty years in the wilderness was only a figurative word for farmers and they kept up the practice to this day and now says andy i am going to test my theory once a farmer always a come on in spite of the veneering and the orifices that a spurious civilization has brought to him you ll fail same as i did says i this one s shook off the shackles of the sheep fold he s entrenched behind the advantages of electricity education literature and intelligence i ll try said andy there are certain laws of nature that free rural delivery can t overcome andy fumbles around awhile in the closet and comes out dressed in a suit with brown and yellow checks as big as your hand his vest is red with blue dots and he wears a high silk hat i noticed he d soaked his sandy mustache in a kind of blue ink great barnums says i you re a ringer for a circus thimblerig man right says andy is the buggy outside wait here till i come back i won t be long two hours afterwards andy steps into the room and lays a wad of money on the table eight hundred and sixty dollars said he let me tell you he was in he looked me over and began to guy me i didn t say a word but got out the walnut shells and began to roll the little ball on the table i whistled a tune or two and then i started up the old formula step up lively gentlemen says i and watch the little ball it costs you nothing to look there you see it and there you don t guess where the little joker is the quickness of the hand deceives the eye i steals a look at the farmer man i see the sweat coming out on his forehead he goes over and closes the front door and watches me some more directly he says i ll bet you twenty i can pick the shell the ball s under now after that goes on andy there is nothing new to relate he only had cash in the house when i left he followed me to the gate there was tears in his eyes when he shook hands bunk says he thank you for the only real pleasure i ve had in years it brings up happy old days when i was only a farmer and not an agriculturalist god bless you here jeff peters ceased and i inferred that his story was done then you think i began yes said jeff something like that you let the farmers go ahead and amuse themselves with politics farming s a lonesome life and they ve been against the shell game before the chair of philanthromathematics i see that the cause of education has received the princely gift of more than fifty millions of dollars said i i was gleaning the stray items from the evening papers while jeff peters packed his briar pipe with plug cut which same said jeff calls for a new deck and a recitation by the entire class in philanthromathematics is that an allusion i asked it is said jeff i never told you about the time when me and andy tucker was philanthropists did i it was eight years ago in arizona andy and me was out in the gila mountains with a two horse wagon prospecting for silver we struck it and sold out to parties in tucson for they paid our check at the bank in silver a thousand dollars in a sack we loaded it in our wagon and drove east a hundred miles before we recovered our presence of intellect twenty five thousand dollars doesn t sound like so much when you re reading the annual report of the pennsylvania railroad or listening to an actor talking about his salary but when you can raise up a wagon sheet and kick around your bootheel and hear every one of em ring against another it makes you feel like you was a night and day bank with the clock striking twelve the third day out we drove into one of the most specious and tidy little towns that nature or rand and mcnally ever turned out it was in the foothills and mitigated with trees and flowers and about head of cordial and dilatory inhabitants the town seemed to be called floresville and nature had not contaminated it with many railroads fleas or eastern tourists me and andy deposited our money to the credit of peters and tucker in the esperanza savings bank and got rooms at the skyview hotel after supper we lit up and sat out on the gallery and smoked then was when the philanthropy idea struck me i suppose every grafter gets it sometime when a man swindles the public out of a certain amount he begins to get scared and wants to return part of it and if you ll watch close and notice the way his charity runs you ll see that he tries to restore it to the same people he got it from as a hydrostatical case take let s say a a made his millions selling oil to poor students who sit up nights studying political economy and methods for regulating the trusts so back to the universities and colleges goes his conscience dollars there s b got his from the common laboring man that works with his hands and tools how s he to get some of the remorse fund back into their overalls aha says b i ll do it in the name of education i ve skinned the laboring man says he to himself but according to the old proverb charity covers a multitude of skins so he puts up eighty million dollars worth of libraries and the boys with the dinner pail that builds em gets the benefit where s the books asks the reading public i dinna ken says b i offered ye libraries and there they are i suppose if i d given ye preferred steel trust stock instead ye d have wanted the water in it set out in cut glass decanters hoot for ye but as i said the owning of so much money was beginning to give me philanthropitis it was the first time me and andy had ever made a pile big enough to make us stop and think how we got it andy says i we re wealthy not beyond the dreams of average but in our humble way we are comparatively as rich as greasers i feel as if i d like to do something for as well as to humanity i was thinking the same thing jeff says he we ve been gouging the public for a long time with all kinds of little schemes from selling self igniting celluloid collars to flooding georgia with hoke smith presidential campaign buttons i d like myself to hedge a bet or two in the graft game if i could do it without actually banging the cymbalines in the salvation army or teaching a bible class by the bertillon system what ll we do says andy give free grub to the poor or send a couple of thousand to george cortelyou neither says i we ve got too much money to be implicated in plain charity and we haven t got enough to make restitution so we ll look about for something that s about half way between the two the next day in walking around floresville we see on a hill a big red brick building that appears to be disinhabited the citizens speak up and tell us that it was begun for a residence several years before by a mine owner after running up the house he finds he only had left to furnish it with so he invests that in whiskey and jumps off the roof on a spot where he now requiescats in pieces as soon as me and andy saw that building the same idea struck both of us we would fix it up with lights and pen wipers and professors and put an iron dog and statues of hercules and father john on the lawn and start one of the finest free educational institutions in the world right there so we talks it over to the prominent citizens of floresville who falls in fine with the idea they give a banquet in the engine house to us and we make our bow for the first time as benefactors to the cause of progress and enlightenment andy makes an hour and a half speech on the subject of irrigation in lower egypt and we have a moral tune on the phonograph and pineapple sherbet andy and me didn t lose any time in philanthropping we put every man in town that could tell a hammer from a step ladder to work on the building dividing it up into class rooms and lecture halls we wire to frisco for a car load of desks footballs arithmetics penholders dictionaries chairs for the professors slates skeletons sponges twenty seven cravenetted gowns and caps for the senior class and an open order for all the truck that goes with a first class university i took it on myself to put a campus and a curriculum on the list but the telegraph operator must have got the words wrong being an ignorant man for when the goods come we found a can of peas and a curry comb among em while the weekly papers was having chalk plate cuts of me and andy we wired an employment agency in chicago to express us f o b six professors immediately one english literature one up to date dead languages one chemistry one political economy democrat preferred one logic and one wise to painting italian and music with union card the esperanza bank guaranteed salaries which was to run between and well sir we finally got in shape over the front door was carved the words the world s university peters tucker patrons and proprietors and when september the first got a cross mark on the calendar the come ons begun to roll in first the faculty got off the tri weekly express from tucson they was mostly young spectacled and red headed with sentiments divided between ambition and food andy and me got em billeted on the floresvillians and then laid for the students they came in bunches we had advertised the university in all the state papers and it did us good to see how quick the country responded two hundred and nineteen husky lads aging along from up to chin whiskers answered the clarion call of free education they ripped open that town sponged the seams turned it lined it with new mohair and you couldn t have told it from harvard or goldfields at the march term of court they marched up and down the streets waving flags with the world s university colors ultra marine and blue and they certainly made a lively place of floresville andy made them a speech from the balcony of the skyview hotel and the whole town was

even to her soft words murmured in sleep hoping to catch an idea for my next day s grind there is worse to come god help me next my fangs were buried deep in the neck of the fugitive sayings of my little children guy and viola were two bright fountains of childish quaint thoughts and speeches i found a ready sale for this kind of humor and was furnishing a regular department in a magazine with funny fancies of childhood i began to stalk them as an indian stalks the antelope i would hide behind sofas and doors or crawl on my hands and knees among the bushes in the yard to eavesdrop while they were at play i had all the qualities of a harpy except remorse once when i was barren of ideas and my copy must leave in the next mail i covered myself in a pile of autumn leaves in the yard where i knew they intended to come to play i cannot bring myself to believe that guy was aware of my hiding place but even if he was i would be loath to blame him for his setting fire to the leaves causing the destruction of my new suit of clothes and nearly cremating a parent soon my own children began to shun me as a pest often when i was creeping upon them like a melancholy ghoul i would hear them say to each other here comes papa and they would gather their toys and scurry away to some safer hiding place miserable wretch that i was and yet i was doing well financially before the first year had passed i had saved a thousand dollars and we had lived in comfort but at what a cost i am not quite clear as to what a pariah is but i was everything that it sounds like i had no friends no amusements no enjoyment of life the happiness of my family had been sacrificed i was a bee sucking sordid honey from life s fairest flowers dreaded and shunned on account of my stingo one day a man spoke to me with a pleasant and friendly smile not in months had the thing happened i was passing the undertaking establishment of peter heffelbower peter stood in the door and saluted me i stopped strangely wrung in my heart by his greeting he asked me inside the day was chill and rainy we went into the back room where a fire burned in a little stove a customer came and peter left me alone for a while presently i felt a new feeling stealing over me a sense of beautiful calm and content i looked around the place there were rows of shining rosewood caskets black palls trestles hearse plumes mourning streamers and all the paraphernalia of the solemn trade here was peace order silence the abode of grave and dignified reflections here on the brink of life was a little niche pervaded by the spirit of eternal rest when i entered it the follies of the world abandoned me at the door i felt no inclination to wrest a humorous idea from those sombre and stately trappings my mind seemed to stretch itself to grateful repose upon a couch draped with gentle thoughts a quarter of an hour ago i was an abandoned humorist now i was a philosopher full of serenity and ease i had found a refuge from humor from the hot chase of the shy quip from the degrading pursuit of the panting joke from the restless reach after the nimble repartee i had not known heffelbower well when he came back i let him talk fearful that he might prove to be a jarring note in the sweet dirgelike harmony of his establishment but no he chimed truly i gave a long sigh of happiness never have i known a man s talk to be as magnificently dull as peter s was compared with it the dead sea is a geyser never a sparkle or a glimmer of wit marred his words commonplaces as trite and as plentiful as blackberries flowed from his lips no more stirring in quality than a last week s tape running from a ticker quaking a little i tried upon him one of my best pointed jokes it fell back ineffectual with the point broken i loved that man from then on two or three evenings each week i would steal down to heffelbower s and revel in his back room that was my only joy i began to rise early and hurry through my work that i might spend more time in my haven in no other place could i throw off my habit of extracting humorous ideas from my surroundings peter s talk left me no opening had i besieged it ever so hard under this influence i began to improve in spirits it was the recreation from one s labor which every man needs i surprised one or two of my former friends by throwing them a smile and a cheery word as i passed them on the streets several times i dumfounded my family by relaxing long enough to make a jocose remark in their presence i had so long been ridden by the incubus of humor that i seized my hours of holiday with a schoolboy s zest mv work began to suffer it was not the pain and burden to me that it had been i often whistled at my desk and wrote with far more fluency than before i accomplished my tasks impatiently as anxious to be off to my helpful retreat as a drunkard is to get to his tavern my wife had some anxious hours in conjecturing where i spent my afternoons i thought it best not to tell her women do not understand these things poor girl she had one shock out of it one day i brought home a silver coffin handle for a paper weight and a fine fluffy hearse plume to dust my papers with i loved to see them on my desk and think of the beloved back room down at heffelbower s but louisa found them and she shrieked with horror i had to console her with some lame excuse for having them but i saw in her eyes that the prejudice was not removed i had to remove the articles though at double quick time one day peter heffelbower laid before me a temptation that swept me off my feet in his sensible uninspired way he showed me his books and explained that his profits and his business were increasing rapidly he had thought of taking in a partner with some cash he would rather have me than any one he knew when i left his place that afternoon peter had my check for the thousand dollars i had in the bank and i was a partner in his undertaking business i went home with feelings of delirious joy mingled with a certain amount of doubt i was dreading to tell my wife about it but i walked on air to give up the writing of humorous stuff once more to enjoy the apples of life instead of squeezing them to a pulp for a few drops of hard cider to make the pubic feel funny what a boon that would be at the supper table louisa handed me some letters that had come during my absence several of them contained rejected manuscript ever since i first began going to heffelbower s my stuff had been coming back with alarming frequency lately i had been dashing off my jokes and articles with the greatest fluency previously i had labored like a bricklayer slowly and with agony presently i opened a letter from the editor of the weekly with which i had a regular contract the checks for that weekly article were still our main dependence the letter ran thus dear sir as you are aware our contract for the year expires with the present month while regretting the necessity for so doing we must say that we do not care to renew same for the coming year we were quite pleased with your style of humor which seems to have delighted quite a large proportion of our readers but for the past two months we have noticed a decided falling off in its quality your earlier work showed a spontaneous easy natural flow of fun and wit of late it is labored studied and unconvincing giving painful evidence of hard toil and drudging mechanism again regretting that we do not consider your contributions available any longer we are yours sincerely the editor i handed this letter to my wife after she had read it her face grew extremely long and there were tears in her eyes the mean old thing she exclaimed indignantly i m sure your pieces are just as good as they ever were and it doesn t take you half as long to write them as it did and then i suppose louisa thought of the checks that would cease coming oh john she wailed what will you do now for an answer i got up and began to do a polka step around the supper table i am sure louisa thought the trouble had driven me mad and i think the children hoped it had for they tore after me yelling with glee and emulating my steps i was now something like their old playmate as of yore the theatre for us to night i shouted nothing less and a late wild disreputable supper for all of us at the palace restaurant lumpty diddle de dee de dum and then i explained my glee by declaring that i was now a partner in a prosperous undertaking establishment and that written jokes might go hide their heads in sackcloth and ashes for all me with the editor s letter in her hand to justify the deed i had done my wife could advance no objections save a few mild ones based on the feminine inability to appreciate a good thing such as the little back room of peter hef no of heffelbower co s undertaking establishment in conclusion i will say that to day you will find no man in our town as well liked as jovial and full of merry sayings as i my jokes are again noised about and quoted once more i take pleasure in my wife s confidential chatter without a mercenary thought while guy and viola play at my feet distributing gems of childish humor without fear of the ghastly tormentor who used to dog their steps notebook in hand our business has prospered finely i keep the books and look after the shop while peter attends to outside matters he says that my levity and high spirits would simply turn any funeral into a regular irish wake the sparrows in madison square the young man in straitened circumstances who comes to new york city to enter literature has but one thing to do provided he has studied carefully his field in advance he must go straight to madison square write an article about the sparrows there and sell it to the sun for i cannot recall either a novel or a story dealing with the popular theme of the young writer from the provinces who comes to the metropolis to win fame and fortune with his pen in which the hero does not get his start that way it does seem strange that some author in casting about for startlingly original plots has not hit upon the idea of having his hero write about the bluebirds in union square and sell it to the herald but a search through the files of metropolitan fiction counts up overwhelmingly for the sparrows and the old garden square and the sun always writes the check of course it is easy to understand why this first city venture of the budding author is always successful he is primed by necessity to a superlative effort mid the iron and stone and marble of the roaring city he has found this spot of singing birds and green grass and trees every tender sentiment in his nature is baffling with the sweet pain of homesickness his genius is aroused as it never may be again the birds chirp the tree branches sway the noise of wheels is forgotten he writes with his soul in his pen and he sells it to the sun for i had read of this custom during many years before i came to new york when my friends were using their strongest arguments to dissuade me from coming i only smiled serenely they did not know of that sparrow graft i had up my sleeve when i arrived in new york and the car took me straight from the ferry up twenty third street to madison square i could hear that check rustling in my inside pocket i obtained lodging at an unhyphenated hostelry and the next morning i was on a bench in madison square almost by the time the sparrows were awake their melodious chirping the benignant spring foliage of the noble trees and the clean fragrant grass reminded me so potently of the old farm i had left that tears almost came into my eyes then all in a moment i felt my inspiration the brave piercing notes of those cheerful small birds formed a keynote to a wonderful light fanciful song of hope and joy and altruism like myself they were creatures with hearts pitched to the tune of woods and fields as i was so were they captives by circumstance in the discordant dull city yet with how much grace and glee they bore the restraint and then the early morning people began to pass through the square to their work sullen people with sidelong glances and glum faces hurrying hurrying hurrying and i got my theme cut out clear from the bird notes and wrought it into a lesson and a poem and a carnival dance and a lullaby and then translated it all into prose and began to write for two hours my pencil traveled over my pad with scarcely a rest then i went to the little room i had rented for two days and there i cut it to half and then mailed it white hot to the sun the next morning i was up by daylight and spent two cents of my capital for a paper if the word sparrow was in it i was unable to find it i took it up to my room and spread it out on the bed and went over it column by column something was wrong three hours afterward the postman brought me a large envelope containing my ms and a piece of inexpensive paper about inches by i suppose some of you have seen them upon which was written in violet ink with the sun s thanks i went over to the square and sat upon a bench no i did not think it necessary to eat any breakfast that morning the confounded pests of sparrows were making the square hideous with their idiotic cheep cheep i never saw birds so persistently noisy impudent and disagreeable in all my life by this time according to all traditions i should have been standing in the office of the editor of the sun that personage a tall grave white haired man would strike a silver bell as he grasped my hand and wiped a suspicious moisture from his glasses mr mcchesney he would be saying when a subordinate appeared this is mr henry the young man who sent in that exquisite gem about the sparrows in madison square you may give him a desk at once your salary sir will be a week to begin with this was what i had been led to expect by all writers who have evolved romances of literary new york something was decidedly wrong with tradition i could not assume the blame so i fixed it upon the sparrows i began to hate them with intensity and heat at that moment an individual wearing an excess of whiskers two hats and a pestilential air slid into the seat beside me say willie he muttered cajolingly could you cough up a dime out of your coffers for a cup of coffee this morning i m lung weary my friend said i the best i can do is three cents and you look like a gentleman too said he what brung you down boozer birds i said fiercely the brown throated songsters carolling songs of hope and cheer to weary man toiling amid the city s dust and din the little feathered couriers from the meadows and woods chirping sweetly to us of blue skies and flowering fields the confounded little squint eyed nuisances yawping like a flock of steam pianos and stuffing themselves like aldermen with grass seeds and bugs while a man sits on a bench and goes without his breakfast yes sir birds look at them as i spoke i picked up a dead tree branch that lay by the bench and hurled it with all my force into a close congregation of the sparrows on the grass the flock flew to the trees with a babel of shrill cries but two of them remained prostrate upon the turf in a moment my unsavory friend had leaped over the row of benches and secured the fluttering victims which he thrust hurriedly into his pockets then he beckoned me with a dirty forefinger come on cully he said hoarsely you re in on the feed thank you very much weakly i followed my dingy acquaintance he led me away from the park down a side street and through a crack in a fence into a vacant lot where some excavating had been going on behind a pile of old stones and lumber he paused and took out his birds i got matches said he you got any paper to start a fire with i drew forth my manuscript story of the sparrows and offered it for burnt sacrifice there were old planks splinters and chips for our fire my frowsy friend produced from some interior of his frayed clothing half a loaf of bread pepper and salt in ten minutes each of us was holding a sparrow spitted upon a stick over the leaping flames say said my fellow bivouacker this ain t so bad when a fellow s hungry it reminds me of when i struck new york first about fifteen years ago i come in from the west to see if i could get a job on a newspaper i hit the madison square park the first mornin after and was sitting around on the benches i noticed the sparrows chirpin and the grass and trees so nice and green that i thought i was back in the country again then i got some papers out of my pocket and i know i interrupted you sent it to the sun and got say said my friend suspiciously you seem to know a good deal where was you i went to sleep on the bench there in the sun and somebody touched me for every cent i had hearts and hands at denver there was an influx of passengers into the coaches on the eastbound b m express in one coach there sat a very pretty young woman dressed in elegant taste and surrounded by all the luxurious comforts of an experienced traveler among the newcomers were two young men one of handsome presence with a bold frank countenance and manner the other a ruffled glum faced person heavily built and roughly dressed the two were handcuffed together as they passed down the aisle of the coach the only vacant seat offered was a reversed one facing the attractive young woman here the linked couple seated themselves the young woman s glance fell upon them with a distant swift disinterest then with a lovely smile brightening her countenance and a tender pink tingeing her rounded cheeks she held out a little gray gloved hand when she spoke her voice full sweet and deliberate proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard well mr easton if you will make me speak first i suppose i must don t vou ever recognize old friends when you meet them in the west the younger man roused himself sharply at the sound of her voice seemed to struggle with a slight embarrassment which he threw off instantly and then clasped her fingers with his left hand it s miss fairchild he said with a smile i ll ask you to excuse the other hand it s otherwise engaged just at present he slightly raised his right hand bound at the wrist by the shining bracelet to the left one of his companion the glad look in the girl s eyes slowly changed to a bewildered horror the glow faded from her cheeks her lips parted in a vague relaxing distress easton with a little laugh as if amused was about to speak again when the other forestalled him the glum faced man had been watching the girl s countenance with veiled glances from his keen shrewd eyes you ll excuse me for speaking miss but i see you re acquainted with the marshall here if you ll ask him to speak a word for me when we get to the pen he ll do it and it ll make things easier for me there he s taking me to leavenworth prison it s seven years for counterfeiting oh said the girl with a deep breath and returning color so that is what you are doing out here a marshal my dear miss fairchild said easton calmly i had to do something money has a way of taking wings unto itself and you know it takes money to keep step with our crowd in washington i saw this opening in the west and well a marshalship isn t quite as high a position as that of ambassador but the ambassador said the girl warmly doesn t call any more he needn t ever have done so you ought to know that and so now you are one of these dashing western heroes and you ride and shoot and go into all kinds of dangers that s different from the washington life you have been missed from the old crowd the girl s eyes fascinated went back widening a little to rest upon the glittering handcuffs don t you worry about them miss said the other man all marshals handcuff themselves to their prisoners to keep them from getting away mr easton knows his business will we see you again soon in washington asked the girl not soon i think said easton my butterfly days are over i fear i love the west said the girl irrelevantly her eyes were shining softly she looked away out the car window she began to speak truly and simply without the gloss of style and manner mamma and i spent the summer in denver she went home a week ago because father was slightly ill i could live and be happy in the west i think the air here agrees with me money isn t everything but people always misunderstand things and remain stupid say mr marshal growled the glum faced man this isn t quite fair i m needing a drink and haven t had a smoke all day haven t you talked long enough take me in the smoker now won t you i m half dead for a pipe the bound travelers rose to their feet easton with the same slow smile on his face i can t deny a petition for tobacco he said lightly it s the one friend of the unfortunate good bye miss fairchild duty calls you know he held out his hand for a farewell it s too bad you are not going east she said reclothing herself with manner and style but you must go on to leavenworth i suppose yes said easton i must go on to leavenworth the two men sidled down the aisle into the smoker the two passengers in a seat near by had heard most of the conversation said one of them that marshal s a good sort of chap some of these western fellows are all right pretty young to hold an office like that isn t he asked the other young exclaimed the first speaker why oh didn t you catch on say did you ever know an officer to handcuff a prisoner to his right hand the cactus the most notable thing about time is that it is so purely relative a large amount of reminiscence is by common consent conceded to the drowning man and it is not past belief that one may review an entire courtship while removing one s gloves that is what trysdale was doing standing by a table in his bachelor apartments on the table stood a singular looking green plant in a red earthen jar the plant was one of the species of cacti and was provided with long tentacular leaves that perpetually swayed with the slightest breeze with a peculiar beckoning motion trysdale s friend the brother of the bride stood at a sideboard complaining at being allowed to drink alone both men were in evening dress white favors like stars upon their coats shone through the gloom of the apartment as he slowly unbuttoned his gloves there passed through trysdale s mind a swift scarifying retrospect of the last few hours it seemed that in his nostrils was still the scent of the flowers that had been banked in odorous masses about the church and in his ears the lowpitched hum of a thousand well bred voices the rustle of crisp garments and most insistently recurring the drawling words of the minister irrevocably binding her to another from this last hopeless point of view he still strove as if it had become a habit of his mind to reach some conjecture as to why and how he had lost her shaken rudely by the uncompromising fact he had suddenly found himself confronted by a thing he had never before faced his own innermost unmitigated arid unbedecked self he saw all the garbs of pretence and egoism that he had worn now turn to rags of folly he shuddered at the thought that to others before now the garments of his soul must have appeared sorry and threadbare vanity and conceit these were the joints in his armor and how free from either she had always been but why as she had slowly moved up the aisle toward the altar he had felt an unworthy sullen exultation that had served to support him he had told himself that her paleness was from thoughts of another than the man to whom she was about to give herself but even that poor consolation had been wrenched from him for when he saw that swift limpid upward look that she gave the man when he took her hand he knew himself to be forgotten once that same look had been raised to him and he had gauged its meaning indeed his conceit had crumbled its last prop was gone why had it ended thus there had been no quarrel between them nothing for the thousandth time he remarshalled in his mind the events of those last few days before the tide had so suddenly turned she had always insisted upon placing him upon a pedestal and he had accepted her homage with royal grandeur it had been a very sweet incense that she had burned before him so modest he told himself so childlike and worshipful and he would once have sworn so sincere she had invested him with an almost supernatural number of high attributes and excellencies and talents and he had absorbed the oblation as a desert drinks the rain that can coax from it no promise of blossom or fruit as trysdale grimly wrenched apart the seam of his last glove the crowning instance of his fatuous and tardily mourned egoism came vividly back to him the scene was the night when he had asked her to come up on his pedestal with him and share his greatness he could not now for the pain of it allow his mind to dwell upon the memory of her convincing beauty that night the careless wave of her hair the tenderness and virginal charm of her looks and words but they had been enough and they had brought him to speak during their conversation she had said and captain carruthers tells me that you speak the spanish language like a native why have you hidden this accomplishment from me is there anything you do not know now carruthers was an idiot no doubt he trysdale had been guilty he sometimes did such things of airing at the club some old canting castilian proverb dug from the hotchpotch at the back of dictionaries carruthers who was one of his incontinent admirers was the very man to have magnified this exhibition of doubtful erudition but alas the incense of her admiration had been so sweet and flattering he allowed the imputation to pass without denial without protest he allowed her to twine about his brow this spurious bay of spanish scholarship he let it grace his conquering head and among its soft convolutions he did not feel the prick of the thorn that was to pierce him later how glad how shy how tremulous she was how she fluttered like a snared bird when he laid his mightiness at her feet he could have sworn and he could swear now that unmistakable consent was in her eyes but coyly she would give him no direct answer i will send you my answer to morrow she said and he the indulgent confident victor smilingly granted the delay the next day he waited impatient in his rooms for the word at noon her groom came to the door and left the strange cactus in the red earthen jar there was no note no message merely a tag upon the plant bearing a barbarous foreign or botanical name he waited until night but her answer did not come his large pride and hurt vanity kept him from seeking her two evenings later they met at a dinner their greetings were conventional but she looked at him breathless wondering eager he was courteous adamant waiting her explanation with womanly swiftness she took her cue from his manner and turned to snow and ice thus and wider from this on they had drifted apart where was his fault who had been to blame humbled now he sought the answer amid the ruins of his self conceit if the voice of the other man in the room querulously intruding upon his thoughts aroused him i say trysdale what the deuce is the matter with you you look unhappy as if you yourself had been married instead of having acted merely as an accomplice look at me another accessory come two thousand miles on a garlicky cockroachy banana steamer all the way from south america to connive at the sacrifice please to observe how lightly my guilt rests upon my shoulders only little sister i had too and now she s gone come now take something to ease your conscience i don t drink just now thanks said trysdale your brandy resumed the other coming over and joining him is abominable run down to see me some time at punta redonda and try some of our stuff that old garcia smuggles in it s worth the trip hallo here s an old acquaintance wherever did you rake up this cactus trysdale a present said trysdale from a friend know the species very well it s a tropical concern see hundreds of em around punta every day here s the name on this tag tied to it know any spanish trysdale no said trysdale with the bitter wraith of a smile is it spanish yes the natives imagine the leaves are reaching out and beckoning to you they call it by this name ventomarme name means in english come and take me the detective detector i was walking in central park with avery knight the great new york burglar highwayman and murderer but my dear knight said i it sounds incredible you have undoubtedly performed some of the most wonderful feats in your profession known to modern crime you have committed some marvellous deeds under the very noses of the police you have boldly entered the homes of millionaires and held them up with an empty gun while you made free with their silver and jewels you have sandbagged citizens in the glare of broadway s electric lights you have killed and robbed with superb openness and absolute impunity but when you boast that within forty eight hours after committing a murder you can run down and actually bring me face to face with the detective assigned to apprehend you i must beg leave to express my doubts remember you are in new york avery knight smiled indulgently you pique my professional pride doctor he said in a nettled tone i will convince you about twelve yards in advance of us a prosperous looking citizen was rounding a clump of bushes where the walk curved knight suddenly drew a revolver and shot the man in the back his victim fell and lay without moving the great murderer went up to him leisurely and took from his clothes his money watch and a valuable ring and cravat pin he then rejoined me smiling calmly and we continued our walk ten steps and we met a policeman running toward the spot where the shot had been fired avery knight stopped him i have just killed a man he announced seriously and robbed him of his possessions g wan said the policeman angrily or i ll run yez in want yer name in the papers don t yez i never knew the cranks to come around so quick after a shootin before out of th park now for yours or i ll fan yez what you have done i said argumentatively as knight and i walked on was easy but when you come to the task of hunting down the detective that they send upon your trail you will find that you have undertaken a difficult feat perhaps so said knight lightly i will admit that my success depends in a degree upon the sort of man they start after me if it should be an ordinary plain clothes man i might fail to gain a sight of him if they honor me by giving the case to some one of their celebrated sleuths i do not fear to match my cunning and powers of induction against his on the next afternoon knight entered my office with a satisfied look on his keen countenance how goes the mysterious murder i asked as usual said knight smilingly i have put in the morning at the police station and at the inquest it seems that a card case of mine containing cards with my name and address was found near the body they have three witnesses who saw the shooting and gave a description of me the case has been placed in the hands of shamrock jolnes the famous detective he left headquarters at on the assignment i waited at my address until two thinking he might call there i laughed tauntingly you will never see jolnes i continued until this murder has been forgotten two or three weeks from now i had a better opinion of your shrewdness knight during the three hours and a half that you waited he has got out of your ken he is after you on true induction theories now and no wrongdoer has yet been known to come upon him while thus engaged i advise you to give it up doctor said knight with a sudden glint in his keen gray eye and a squaring of his chin in spite of the record your city holds of something like a dozen homicides without a subsequent meeting of the perpetrator and the sleuth in charge of the case i will undertake to break that record to morrow i will take you to shamrock jolnes i will unmask him before you and prove to you that it is not an impossibility for an officer of the law and a manslayer to stand face to face in your city do it said i and you ll have the sincere thanks of the police department on the next day knight called for me in a cab i ve been on one or two false scents doctor he admitted i know something of detectives methods and i followed out a few of them expecting to find jolnes at the other end the pistol being a caliber i thought surely i would find him at work on the clue in forty fifth street then again i looked for the detective at the columbia university as the man s being shot in the back naturally suggested hazing but i could not find a trace of him nor will you i said emphatically not by ordinary methods said knight i might walk up and down broadway for a month without success but you have aroused my pride doctor and if i fail to show you shamrock jolnes this day i promise you i will never kill or rob in your city again nonsense man i replied when our burglars walk into our houses and politely demand thousands of dollars worth of jewels and then dine and bang the piano an hour or two before leaving how do you a mere murderer expect to come in contact with the detective that is looking for you avery knight sat lost in thought for a while at length he looked up brightly doc said he i have it put on your hat and come with me in half an hour i guarantee that you shall stand in the presence of shamrock jolnes i entered a cab with avery knight i did not hear his instructions to the driver but the vehicle set out at a smart pace up broadway turning presently into fifth avenue and proceeding northward again it was with a rapidly beating heart that i accompanied this wonderful and gifted assassin whose analytical genius and superb self confidence had prompted him to make me the tremendous promise of bringing me into the presence of a murderer and the new york detective in pursuit of him simultaneously even yet i could not believe it possible are you sure that you are not being led into some trap i asked suppose that your clue whatever it is should bring us only into the presence of the commissioner of police and a couple of dozen cops my dear doctor said knight a little stiffly i would remind you that i am no gambler i beg your pardon said i but i do not think you will find jolnes the cab stopped before one of the handsomest residences on the avenue walking up and down in front of the house was a man with long red whiskers with a detective s badge showing on the lapel of his coat now and then the man would remove his whiskers to wipe his face and then i would recognize at once the well known features of the great new york detective jolnes was keeping a sharp watch upon the doors and windows of the house well doctor said knight unable to repress a note of triumph in his voice have you seen it is wonderful wonderful i could not help exclaiming as our cab started on its return trip but how did you do it by what process of induction my dear doctor interrupted the great murderer the inductive theory is what the detectives use my process is more modern i call it the saltatorial theory without bothering with the tedious mental phenomena necessary to the solution of a mystery from slight clues i jump at once to a conclusion i will explain to you the method i employed in this case in the first place i argued that as the crime was committed in new york city in broad daylight in a public place and under peculiarly atrocious circumstances and that as the most skilful sleuth available was let loose upon the case the perpetrator would never be discovered do you not think my postulation justified by precedent perhaps so i replied doggedly but if big bill dev stop that interrupted knight with a smile i ve heard that several times it s too late now i will proceed if homicides in new york went undiscovered i reasoned although the best detective talent was employed to ferret them out it must be true that the detectives went about their work in the wrong way and not only in the wrong way but exactly opposite from the right way that was my clue i slew the man in central park now let me describe myself to you i am tall with a black beard and i hate publicity i have no money to speak of i do not like oatmeal and it is the one ambition of my life to die rich i am of a cold and heartless disposition i do not care for my fellowmen and i never give a cent to beggars or charity now my dear doctor that is the true description of myself the man whom that shrewd detective was to hunt down you who are familiar with the history of crime in new york of late should be able to foretell the result when i promised you to exhibit to your incredulous gaze the sleuth who was set upon me you laughed at me because you said that detectives and murderers never met in new york i have demonstrated to you that the theory is possible but how did you do it i asked again it was very simple replied the distinguished murderer i assumed that the detective would go exactly opposite to the clues he had i have given you a description of myself therefore he must necessarily set to work and trail a short man with a white beard who likes to be in the papers who is very wealthy is fond of oatmeal wants to die poor and is of an extremely generous and philanthropic disposition when thus far is reached the mind hesitates no longer i conveyed you at once to the spot where shamrock jolnes was piping off andrew carnegie s residence knight said i you re a wonder if there was no danger of your reforming what a rounds man you d make for the nineteenth precinct the dog and the playlet this story has been rewritten and published in strictly business under the title the proof of the pudding usually it is a cold day in july when you can stroll up broadway in that month and get a story out of the drama i found one a few breathless parboiling days ago and it seems to decide a serious question in art there was not a soul left in the city except hollis and me and two or three million sunworshippers who remained at desks and counters the elect had fled to seashore lake and mountain and had already begun to draw for additional funds every evening hollis and i prowled about the deserted town searching for coolness in empty cafes dining rooms and roofgardens we knew to the tenth part of a revolution the speed of every electric fan in gotham and we followed the swiftest as they varied hollis s fiancee miss loris sherman had been in the adirondacks at lower saranac lake for a month in another week he would join her party there in the meantime he cursed the city cheerfully and optimistically and sought my society because i suffered him to show me her photograph during the black coffee every time we dined together my revenge was to read to him my one act play it was one insufferable evening when the overplus of the day s heat was being hurled quiveringly back to the heavens by every surcharged brick and stone and inch of iron in the panting town but with the cunning of the two legged beasts we had found an oasis where the hoofs of apollo s steed had not been allowed to strike our seats were on an ocean of cool polished oak the white linen of fifty deserted tables flapped like seagulls in the artificial breeze a mile away a waiter lingered for a heliographic signal we might have roared songs there or fought a duel without molestation out came miss loris s photo with the coffee and i once more praised the elegant poise of the neck the extremely low coiled mass of heavy hair and the eyes that followed one like those in an oil painting she s the greatest ever said hollis with enthusiasm good as great northern preferred and a disposition built like a watch one week more and i ll be happy jonny on the spot old tom tolliver my best college chum went up there two weeks ago he writes me that loris doesn t talk about anything but me oh i guess rip van winkle didn t have all the good luck yes yes said i hurriedly pulling out my typewritten play she s no doubt a charming girl now here s that little curtain raiser you promised to listen to ever been tried on the stage asked hollis not exactly i answered i read half of it the other day to a fellow whose brother knows robert edeson but he had to catch a train before i finished go on said hollis sliding back in his chair like a good fellow i m no stage carpenter but i ll tell you what i think of it from a first row balcony standpoint i m a theatre bug during the season and i can size up a fake play almost as quick as the gallery can flag the waiter once more and then go ahead as hard as you like with it i ll be the dog i read my little play lovingly and i fear not without some elocution there was one scene in it that i believed in greatly the comedy swiftly rises into thrilling and unexpectedly developed drama capt marchmont suddenly becomes cognizant that his wife is an unscrupulous adventuress who has deceived him from the day of their first meeting the rapid and mortal duel between them from that moment she with her magnificent lies and siren charm winding about him like a serpent trying to recover her lost ground he with his man s agony and scorn and lost faith trying to tear her from his heart that scene i always thought was a crackerjack when capt marchmont discovers her duplicity by reading on a blotter in a mirror the impression of a note that she has written to the count he raises his hand to heaven and exclaims o god who created woman while adam slept and gave her to him for a companion take back thy gift and return instead the sleep though it last forever rot said hollis rudely when i had given those lines with proper emphasis i beg your pardon i said as sweetly as i could come now went on hollis don t be an idiot you know very well that nobody spouts any stuff like that these days that sketch went along all right until you rang in the skyrockets cut out that right arm exercise and the adam and eve stunt and make your captain talk as you or i or bill jones would i ll admit said i earnestly for my theory was being touched upon that on all ordinary occasions all of us use commonplace language to convey our thoughts you will rememberthat up to the moment when the captain makes his terrible discovery all the characters on the stage talk pretty much as they would in real life but i believe that i am right in allowing him lines suitable to the strong and tragic situation into which he falls tragic my eye said my friend irreverently in shakespeare s day he might have sputtered out some high cockalorum nonsense of that sort because in those days they ordered ham and eggs in blank verse and discharged the cook with an epic but not for b way in the summer of it is my opinion said i that great human emotions shake up our vocabulary and leave the words best suited to express them on top a sudden violent grief or loss or disappointment will bring expressions out of an ordinary man as strong and solemn and dramatic as those used in fiction or on the stage to portray those emotions that s where you fellows are wrong said hollis plain every day talk is what goes your captain would very likely have kicked the cat lit a cigar stirred up a highball and telephoned for a lawyer instead of getting off those robert mantell pyrotechnics possibly a little later i continued but just at the time just as the blow is delivered if something scriptural or theatrical and deep tongued isn t wrung from a man in spite of his modern and practical way of speaking then i m wrong of course said hollis kindly you ve got to whoop her up some degrees for the stage the audience expects it when the villain kidnaps little effie you have to make her mother claw some chunks out of the atmosphere and scream me chee ild me chee ild what she would actually do would be to call up the police by phone ring for some strong tea and get the little darling s photo out ready for the reporters when you get your villain in a corner a stage corner it s all right for him to clap his hand to his forehead and hiss all is lost off the stage he would remark this is a conspiracy against me i refer you to my lawyers i get no consolation said i gloomily from your concession of an accentuated stage treatment in my play i fondly hoped that i was following life if people in real life meet great crises in a commonplace way they should do the same on the stage and then we drifted like two trout out of our cool pool in the great hotel and began to nibble languidly at the gay flies in the swift current of broadway and our question of dramatic art was unsettled we nibbled at the flies and avoided the hooks as wise trout do but soon the weariness of manhattan in summer overcame us nine stories up facing the south was hollis s apartment and we soon stepped into an elevator bound for that cooler haven i was familiar in those quarters and quickly my play was forgotten and i stood at a sideboard mixing things with cracked ice and glasses all about me a breeze from the bay came in the windows not altogether blighted by the asphalt furnace over which it had passed hollis whistling softly turned over a late arrived letter or two on his table and drew around the coolest wicker armchairs i was just measuring the vermouth carefully when i heard a sound some man s voice groaned hoarsely false oh god false and love is a lie and friendship but the byword of devils i looked around quickly hollis lay across the table with his head down upon his outstretched arms and then he looked up at me and laughed in his ordinary manner i knew him he was poking fun at me about my theory and it did seem so unnatural those swelling words during our quiet gossip that i half began to believe i had been mistaken that my theory was wrong hollis raised himself slowly from the table you were right about that theatrical business old man he said quietly as he tossed a note to me i read it loris had run away with tom tolliver a little talk about mobs i see remarked the tall gentleman in the frock coat and black slouch hat that another street car motorman in your city has narrowly excaped lynching at the hands of an infuriated mob by lighting a cigar and walking a couple of blocks down the street do you think they would have lynched him asked the new yorker in the next seat of the ferry station who was also waiting for the boat not until after the election said the tall man cutting a corner off his plug of tobacco i ve been in your city long enough to know something about your mobs the motorman s mob is about the least dangerous of them all except the national guard and the dressmakers convention you see when little willie goldstein is sent by his mother for pigs knuckles with a nickel tightly grasped in his chubby fist he always crosses the street car track safely twenty feet ahead of the car and then suddenly turns back to ask his inother whether it was pale ale or a spool of white cotton that she wanted the motorman yells and throws himself on the brakes like a football player there is a horrible grinding and then a ripping sound and a piercing shriek and willie is sitting with part of his trousers torn away by the fender screaming for his lost nickel in ten seconds the car is surrounded by infuriated citizens crying lynch the motorman lynch the motorman at the top of their voices some of them run to the nearest cigar store to get a rope but they find the last one has just been cut up and labelled hundreds of the excited mob press close to the cowering motorman whose hand is observed to tremble perceptibly as he transfers a stick of pepsin gum from his pocket to his mouth when the bloodthirsty mob of maddened citizens has closed in on the motorman some bringing camp stools and sitting quite close to him and all shouting lynch him policeman fogarty forces his way through them to the side of their prospective victim hello mike says the motorman in a low voice nice day shall i sneak off a block or so or would you like to rescue me well jerry if you don t mind says the policeman i d like to disperse the infuriated mob singlehanded i haven t defeated a lynching mob since last tuesday and that was a small one of only that wanted to string up a dago boy for selling wormy pears it would boost me some down at the station all right mike says the motorman anything to oblige i ll turn pale and tremble and he does so and policeman fogarty draws his club and says g wan wid yez and in eight seconds the desperate mob has scattered and gone about its business except about a hundred who remain to search for willie s nickel i never heard of a mob in our city doing violence to a motorman because of an accident said the new yorker you are not liable to said the tall man they know the motorman s all right and that he wouldn t even run over a stray dog if he could help it and they know that not a man among em would tie the knot to hang even a thomas cat that had been tried and condemned and sentenced according to law then why do they become infuriated and make threats of lynching asked the new yorker to assure the motorman answered the tall man that he is safe if they really wanted to do him up they would go into the houses and drop bricks on him from the third story windows new yorkers are not cowards said the other man a little stiffly not one at a time agreed the tall man promptly you ve got a fine lot of single handed scrappers in your town i d rather fight three of you than one and i d go up against all the gas trust s victims in a bunch before i d pass two citizens on a dark corner with my watch chain showing when you get rounded up in a bunch you lose your nerve get you in crowds and you re easy ask the l road guards and george b cortelyou and the tintype booths at coney island divided you stand united you fall e pluribus nihil whenever one of your mobs surrounds a man and begins to holler lynch him he says to himself oh dear i suppose i must look pale to please the boys but i will forsooth let my life insurance premium lapse to morrow this is a sure tip for me to play methuselah straight across the board in the next handicap i can imagine the tortured feelings of a prisoner in the hands of new york policemen when an infuriated mob demands that he be turned over to them for lynching for god s sake officers cries the distracted wretch have ye hearts of stone that ye will not let them wrest me from ye sorry jimmy says one of the policemen but it won t do there s three of us me and darrel and the plain clothes man and there s only sivin thousand of the mob how d we explain it at the office if they took ye jist chase the infuriated aggregation around the corner darrel and we ll be movin along to the station some of our gatherings of excited citizens have not been so harmless said the new yorker with a faint note of civic pride i ll admit that said the tall man a cousin of mine who was on a visit here once had an arm broken and lost an ear in one of them that must have been during the cooper union riots remarked the new yorker not the cooper union explained the tall man but it was a union riot at the vanastor wedding you seem to be in favor of lynch law said the new yorker severely no sir i am not no intelligent man is but sir there are certain cases when people rise in their just majesty and take a righteous vengeance for crimes that the law is slow in punishing i am an advocate of law and order but i will say to you that less than six months ago i myself assisted at the lynching of one of that race that is creating a wide chasm between your section of country and mine sir it is a deplorable condition said the new yorker that exists in the south but i am from indiana sir said the tall man taking another chew and i don t think you will condemn my course when i tell you that the colored man in question had stolen in cash sir from my own brother the snow man editorial note before the fatal illness of william sydney porter known through his literary work as o henry this american master

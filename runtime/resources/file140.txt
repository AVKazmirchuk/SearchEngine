long another cop how quickly they scent trouble when trouble is on the wing came along saw them and ran up the steps here what are you doing with that girl he called gruffly she ll be all right in a minute said cork it s a straight deal reverend jeremiah jones read the cop from the door plate with true detective cunning correct said cork on the dead level we re goin to get married the venturers let the story wreck itself on the spreading rails of the non sequitur limited if it will first you must take your seat in the observation car raison d tre for one moment it is for no longer than to consider a brief essay on the subject let us call it what s around the corner omne mundus in duas partes divisum est men who wear rubbers and pay poll taxes and men who discover new continents there are no more continents to discover but by the time overshoes are out of date and the poll has developed into an income tax the other half will be paralleling the canals of mars with radium railways fortune chance and adventure are given as synonymous in the dictionaries to the knowing each has a different meaning fortune is a prize to be won adventure is the road to it chance is what may lurk in the shadows at the roadside the face of fortune is radiant and alluring that of adventure is flushed and heroic the face of chance is the beautiful countenance perfect because vague and dream born that we see in our tea cups at breakfast while we growl over our chops and toast the venturer is one who keeps his eye on the hedgerows and wayside groves and meadows while he travels the road to fortune that is the difference between him and the adventurer eating the forbidden fruit was the best record ever made by a venturer trying to prove that it happened is the highest work of the adventuresome to be either is disturbing to the cosmogony of creation so as bracket sawed and city directoried citizens let us light our pipes chide the children and the cat arrange ourselves in the willow rocker under the flickering gas jet at the coolest window and scan this little tale of two modern followers of chance did you ever hear that story about the man from the west asked billinger in the little dark oak room to your left as you penetrate the interior of the powhatan club doubtless said john reginald forster rising and leaving the room forster got his straw hat straws will be in and maybe out again long before this is printed from the checkroom boy and walked out of the air as hamlet says billinger was used to having his stories insulted and would not mind forster was in his favorite mood and wanted to go away from anywhere a man in order to get on good terms with himself must have his opinions corroborated and his moods matched by some one else i had written that somebody but an a d t boy who once took a telegram for me pointed out that i could save money by using the compound word this is a vice versa case forster s favorite mood was that of greatly desiring to be a follower of chance he was a venturer by nature but convention birth tradition and the narrowing influences of the tribe of manhattan had denied him full privilege he had trodden all the main traveled thoroughfares and many of the side roads that are supposed to relieve the tedium of life but none had sufficed the reason was that he knew what was to be found at the end of every street he knew from experience and logic almost precisely to what end each digression from routine must lead he found a depressing monotony in all the variations that the music of his sphere had grafted upon the tune of life he had not learned that although the world was made round the circle has been squared and that it s true interest is to be in what s around the corner forster walked abroad aimlessly from the powhatan trying not to tax either his judgment or his desire as to what streets he traveled he would have been glad to lose his way if it were possible but he had no hope of that adventure and fortune move at your beck and call in the greater city but chance is oriental she is a veiled lady in a sedan chair protected by a special traffic squad of dragonians crosstown uptown and downtown you may move without seeing her at the end of an hour s stroll forster stood on a corner of a broad smooth avenue looking disconsolately across it at a picturesque old hotel softly but brilliantly lit disconsolately because he knew that he must dine and dining in that hotel was no venture it was one of his favorite caravansaries and so silent and swift would be the service and so delicately choice the food that he regretted the hunger that must be appeased by the dead perfection of the place s cuisine even the music there seemed to be always playing da capo fancy came to him that he would dine at some cheap even dubious restaurant lower down in the city where the erratic chefs from all countries of the world spread their national cookery for the omnivorous american something might happen there out of the routine he might come upon a subject without a predicate a road without an end a question without an answer a cause without an effect a gulf stream in life s salt ocean he had not dressed for evening he wore a dark business suit that would not be questioned even where the waiters served the spaghetti in their shirt sleeves so john reginald forster began to search his clothes for money because the more cheaply you dine the more surely must you pay all of the thirteen pockets large and small of his business suit he explored carefully and found not a penny his bank book showed a balance of five figures to his credit in the old ironsides trust company but forster became aware of a man nearby at his left hand who was really regarding him with some amusement he looked like any business man of thirty or so neatly dressed and standing in the attitude of one waiting for a street car but there was no car line on that avenue so his proximity and unconcealed curiosity seemed to forster to partake of the nature of a personal intrusion but as he was a consistent seeker after what s around the corner instead of manifesting resentment he only turned a half embarrassed smile upon the other s grin of amusement all in asked the intruder drawing nearer seems so said forster now i thought there was a dollar in oh i know said the other man with a laugh but there wasn t i ve just been through the same process myself as i was coming around the corner i found in an upper vest pocket i don t know how they got there exactly two pennies you know what kind of a dinner exactly two pennies will buy you haven t dined then asked forster i have not but i would like to now i ll make you a proposition you look like a man who would take up one your clothes look neat and respectable excuse personalities i think mine will pass the scrutiny of a head waiter also suppose we go over to that hotel and dine together we will choose from the menu like millionaires or if you prefer like gentlemen in moderate circumstances dining extravagantly for once when we have finished we will match with my two pennies to see which of us will stand the brunt of the house s displeasure and vengeance my name is ives i think we have lived in the same station of life before our money took wings you re on said forster joyfully here was a venture at least within the borders of the mysterious country of change anyhow it promised something better than the stale infestivity of a table d h ote the two were soon seated at a corner table in the hotel dining room ives chucked one of his pennies across the table to forster match for which of us gives the order he said forster lost ives laughed and began to name liquids and viands to the waiter with the absorbed but calm deliberation of one who was to the menu born forster listening gave his admiring approval of the order i am a man said ives during the oysters who has made a lifetime search after the to be continued in our next i am not like the ordinary adventurer who strikes for a coveted prize nor yet am i like a gambler who knows he is either to win or lose a certain set stake what i want is to encounter an adventure to which i can predict no conclusion it is the breath of existence to me to dare fate in its blindest manifestations the world has come to run so much by rote and gravitation that you can enter upon hardly any footpath of chance in which you do not find signboards informing you of what you may expect at its end i am like the clerk in the circumlocution office who always complained bitterly when any one came in to ask information he wanted to know you know was the kick he made to his fellow clerks well i don t want to know i don t want to reason i don t want to guess i want to bet my hand without seeing it i understand said forster delightedly i ve often wanted the way i feel put into words you ve done it i want to take chances on what s coming suppose we have a bottle of moselle with the next course agreed said ives i m glad you catch my idea it will increase the animosity of the house toward the loser if it does not weary you we will pursue the theme only a few times have i met a true venturer one who does not ask a schedule and map from fate when he begins a journey but as the world becomes more civilized and wiser the more difficult it is to come upon an adventure the end of which you cannot foresee in the elizabethan days you could assault the watch wring knockers from doors and have a jolly set to with the blades in any convenient angle of a wall and get away with it nowadays if you speak disrespectfully to a policeman all that is left to the most romantic fancy is to conjecture in what particular police station he will land you i know i know said forster nodding approval i returned to new york to day continued ives from a three years ramble around the globe things are not much better abroad than they are at home the whole world seems to be overrun by conclusions the only thing that interests me greatly is a premise i ve tried shooting big game in africa i know what an express rifle will do at so many yards and when an elephant or a rhinoceros falls to the bullet i enjoy it about as much as i did when i was kept in after school to do a sum in long division on the blackboard i know i know said forster there might be something in aeroplanes went on ives reflectively i ve tried ballooning but it seems to be merely a cut and dried affair of wind and ballast women suggested forster with a smile three months ago said ives i was pottering around in one of the bazaars in constantinople i noticed a lady veiled of course but with a pair of especially fine eyes visible who was examining some amber and pearl ornaments at one of the booths with her was an attendant a big nubian as black as coal after a while the attendant drew nearer to me by degrees and slipped a scrap of paper into my hand i looked at it when i got a chance on it was scrawled hastily in pencil the arched gate of the nghtingale garden at nine to night does that appear to you to be an interesting premise mr forster i made inquiries and learned that the nightingale garden was the property of an old turk a grand vizier or something of the sort of course i prospected for the arched gate and was there at nine the same nubian attendant opened the gate promptly on time and i went inside and sat on a bench by a perfumed fountain with the veiled lady we had quite an extended chat she was myrtle thompson a lady journalist who was writing up the turkish harems for a chicago newspaper she said she noticed the new york cut of my clothes in the bazaar and wondered if i couldn t work something into the metropolitan papers about it i see said forster i see i ve canoed through canada said ives down many rapids and over many falls but i didn t seem to get what i wanted out of it because i knew there were only two possible outcomes i would either go to the bottom or arrive at the sea level i ve played all games at cards but the mathematicians have spoiled that sport by computing the percentages i ve made acquaintances on trains i ve answered advertisements i ve rung strange door bells i ve taken every chance that presented itself but there has always been the conventional ending the logical conclusion to the premise i know repeated forster i ve felt it all but i ve had few chances to take my chance at chances is there any life so devoid of impossibilities as life in this city there seems to be a myriad of opportunities for testing the undeterminable but not one in a thousand fails to land you where you expected it to stop i wish the subways and street cars disappointed one as seldom the sun has risen said ives on the arabian nights there are no more caliphs the fisherman s vase is turned to a vacuum bottle warranted to keep any genie boiling or frozen for forty eight hours life moves by rote science has killed adventure there are no more opportunities such as columbus and the man who ate the first oyster had the only certain thing is that there is nothing uncertain well said forster my experience has been the limited one of a city man i haven t seen the world as you have but it seems that we view it with the same opinion but i tell you i am grateful for even this little venture of ours into the borders of the haphazard there may be at least one breathless moment when the bill for the dinner is presented perhaps after all the pilgrims who traveled without scrip or purse found a keener taste to life than did the knights of the round table who rode abroad with a retinue and king arthur s certified checks in the lining of their helmets and now if you ve finished your coffee suppose we match one of your insufficient coins for the impending blow of fate what have i up heads called ives heads it is said forster lifting his hand i lose we forgot to agree upon a plan for the winner to escape i suggest that when the waiter comes you make a remark about telephoning to a friend i will hold the fort and the dinner check long enough for you to get your hat and be off i thank you for an evening out of the ordinary mr ives and wish we might have others if my memory is not at fault said ives laughing the nearest police station is in macdougal street i have enjoyed the dinner too let me assure you forster crooked his finger for the waiter victor with a locomotive effort that seemed to owe more to pneumatics than to pedestrianism glided to the table and laid the card face downward by the loser s cup forster took it up and added the figures with deliberate care ives leaned back comfortably in his chair escuse me said forster but i though you were going to ring grimes about that theatre party for thursday night had you forgotten about it oh said ives settling himself more comfortably i can do that later on get me a glass of water waiter want to be in at the death do you asked forster i hope you don t object said ives pleadingly never in my life have i seen a gentleman arrested in a public restaurant for swindling it out of a dinner all right said forster calmly you are entitled to see a christian die in the arena as your pousse caf victor came with the glass of water and remained with the disengaged air of an inexorable collector forster hesitated for fifteen seconds and then took a pencil from his pocket and scribbled his name on the dinner check the waiter bowed and took it away the fact is said forster with a little embarrassed laugh i doubt whether i m what they call a game sport which means the same as a soldier of fortune i ll have to make a confession i ve been dining at this hotel two or three times a week for more than a year i always sign my checks and then with a note of appreciation in his voice it was first rate of you to stay to see me through with it when you knew i had no money and that you might be scooped in too i guess i ll confess too said ives with a grin i own the hotel i don t run it of course but i always keep a suite on the third floor for my use when i happen to stray into town he called a waiter and said i s mr gilmore still behind the desk all right tell him that mr ives is here and ask him to have my rooms made ready and aired another venture cut short by the inevitable said forster is there a conundrum without an answer in the next number but let s hold to our subject just for a minute or two if you will it isn t often that i meet a man who understands the flaws i pick in existence i am engaged to be married a month from to day i reserve comment said ives right i am going to add to the assertion i am devotedly fond of the lady but i can t decide whether to show up at the church or make a sneak for alaska it s the same idea you know that we were discussing it does for a fellow as far as possibilities are concerned everybody knows the routine you get a kiss flavored with ceylon tea after breakfast you go to the office you come back home and dress for dinner theatre twice a week bills moping around most evenings trying to make conversation a little quarrel occasionally maybe sometimes a big one and a separation or else a settling down into a middle aged contentment which is worst of all i know said ives nodding wisely it s the dead certainty of the thing went on forster that keeps me in doubt there ll nevermore be anything around the corner nothing after the little church said ives i know understand said forster that i am in no doubt as to my feelings toward the lady i may say that i love her truly and deeply but there is something in the current that runs through my veins that cries out against any form of the calculable i do not know what i want but i know that i want it i m talking like an idiot i suppose but i m sure of what i mean i understand you said ives with a slow smile well i think i will be going up to my rooms now if you would dine with me here one evening soon mr forster i d be glad thursday suggested forster at seven if it s convenient answered ives seven goes assented forster at halft past eight ives got into a cab and was driven to a number in one of the correct west seventies his card admitted him to the reception room of an old fashioned house into which the spirits of fortune chance and adventure had never dared to enter on the walls were the whistler etchings the steel engravings by oh what s his name the still life paintings of the grapes and garden truck with the watermelon seeds spilled on the table as natural as life and the greuze head it was a household there was even brass andirons on a table was an album half morocco with oxidized silver protections on the corners of the lids a clock on the mantel ticked loudly with a warning click at five minutes to nine ives looked at it curiously remembering a time piece in his grandmother s home that gave such a warning and then down the stairs and into the room came mary marsden she was twenty four and i leave her to your imagination but i must say this much youth and health and simplicity and courage and greenish violet eyes are beautiful and she had all these she gave ives her hand with the sweet cordiality of an old friendship you can t think what a pleasure it is she said to have you drop in once every three years or so for half an hour they talked i confess that i cannot repeat the conversation you will find it in books in the circulating library when that part of it was over mary said and did you find what you wanted while you were abroad what i wanted said ives yes you know you were always queer even as a boy you wouldn t play marbles or baseball or any game with rules you wanted to dive in water where you didn t know whether it was ten inches or ten feet deep and when you grew up you were just the same we ve often talked about your peculiar ways i suppose i am an incorrigible said ives i am opposed to the doctrine of predestination to the rule of three gravitation taxation and everything of the kind life has always seemed to me something like a serial story would be if they printed above each instalment a synopsis of succeeding chapters mary laughed merrily bob ames told us once she said of a funny thing you did it was when you and he were on a train in the south and you got off at a town where you hadn t intended to stop just because the brakeman hung up a sign in the end of the car with the name of the next station on it i remember said ives that next station has been the thing i ve always tried to get away from i know it said mary and you ve been very foolish i hope you didn t find what you wanted not to find or get off at the station where there wasn t any or whatever it was you expected wouldn t happen to you during the three years you ve been away there was something i wanted before i went away said ives mary looked in his eyes clearly with a slight but perfectly sweet smile there was she said you wanted me and you could have had me as you very well know without replying ives let his gaze wander slowly about the room there had been no change in it since last he had been in it three years before he vividly recalled the thoughts that had been in his mind then the contents of that room were as fixed in their way as the everlasting hills no change would ever come there except the inevitable ones wrought by time and decay that silver mounted album would occupy that corner of that table those pictures would hang on the walls those chairs be found in their same places every morn and noon and night while the household hung together the brass andirons were monuments to order and stability herre and there were relics of a hundred years ago which were still living mementos and would be for many years to come one going from and coming back to that house would never need to forecast or doubt he would find what he left and leave what he found the veiled lady chance would never lift her hand to the knocker on the outer door and before him sat the lady who belonged in the room cool and sweet and unchangeable she was she offered no surprises if one should pass his life with her though she might grow white haired and wrinkled he would never perceive the change three years he had been away from her and she was still waiting for him as established and constant as the house itself he was sure that she had once cared for him it was the knowledge that she would always do so that had driven him away thus his thoughts ran i am going to be married soon said mary on the next thursday afternoon forster came hurriedly to ive s hotel old man said he we ll have to put that dinner off for a year or so i m going abroad the steamer sails at four that was a great talk we had the other night and it decided me i m going to knock around the world and get rid of that incubus that has been weighing on both you and me the terrible dread of knowing what s going to happen i ve done one thing that hurts my conscience a little but i know it s best for both of us i ve written to the lady to whom i was engaged and explained everything told her plainly why i was leaving that the monotony of matrimony would never do for me don t you think i was right it is not for me to say answered ives go ahead and shoot elephants if you think it will bring the element of chance into your life we ve got to decide these things for ourselves but i tell you one thing forster i ve found the way i ve found out the biggest hazard in the world a game of chance that never is concluded a venture that may end in the highest heaven or the blackest pit it will keep a man on edge until the clods fall on his coffin because he will never know not until his last day and not then will he know it is a voayge without a rudder or compass and you must be captain and crew and keep watch every day and night yourself with no one to relieve you i have found the venture don t bother yourself about leaving mary marsden forster i married her yesterday at noon the duel the gods lying beside their nectar on lympus and peeping over the edge of the cliff perceive a difference in cities although it would seem that to their vision towns must appear as large or small ant hills without special characteristics yet it is not so studying the habits of ants frm so great a height should be but a mild diversion when coupled with the soft drink that mythology tells us is their only solace but doubtless they have amused themselves by the comparison of villages and towns and it will be no news to them nor perhaps to many mortals that in one particularity new york stands unique among the cities of the world this shall be the theme of a little story addressed to the man who sits smoking with his sabbath slippered feet on another chair and to the woman who snatches the paper for a moment while boiling greens or a narcotized baby leaves her free with these i love to sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings new york city is inhabited by mysterious strangers thus beating bird centre by three millions and half a dozen nine s they came here in various ways and for many reasons hendrik hudson the art schools green goods the stork the annual dressmakers convention the pennsylvania railroad love of money the stage cheap excursion rates brains personal column ads heavy walking shoes ambition freight trains all these have had a hand in making up the population but every man jack when he first sets foot on the stones of manhattan has got to fight he has got to fight at once until either he or his adversary wins there is no resting between rounds for there are no rounds it is slugging from the first it is a fight to a finish your opponent is the city you must do battle with it from the time the ferry boat lands you on the island until either it is yours or it has conquered you it is the same whether you have a million in your pocket or only the price of a week s lodging the battle is to decide whether you shall become a new yorker or turn the rankest outlander and philistine you must be one or the other you cannot remain neutral you must be for or against lover or enemy bosom friend or outcast and oh the city is a general in the ring not only by blows does it seek to subdue you it woos you to its heart with the subtlety of a siren it is a combination of delilah green chartreuse beethoven chloral and john l in his best days in other cities you may wander and abide as a stranger man as long as you please you may live in chicago until your hair whitens and be a citizen and still prate of beans if boston mothered you and without rebuke you may become a civic pillar in any other town but knickerbocker s and all the time publicly sneering at its buildings comparing them with the architecture of colonel telfair s residence in jackson miss whence you hail and you will not be set upon but in new york you must be either a new yorker or an invader of a modern troy concealed in the wooden horse of your conceited provincialism and this dreary preamble is only to introduce to you the unimportant figures of william and jack they came out of the west together where they had been friends they came to dig their fortunes out of the big city father knickerbocker met them at the ferry giving one a right hander on the nose and the other an upper cut with his left just to let them know that the fight was on william was for business jack was for art both were young and ambitious so they countered and clinched i think they were from nebraska or possibly missouri or minnesota anyhow they were out for success and scraps and scads and they tackled the city like two lochinvars with brass knucks and a pull at the city hall four years afterward william and jack met at luncheon the business man blew in like a march wind hurled his silk hat at a waiter dropped into the chair that was pushed under him seized the bill of fare and had ordered as far as cheese before the artist had time to do more than nod after the nod a humorous smile came into his eyes billy he said you re done for the city has gobbled you up it has taken you and cut you to its pattern and stamped you with its brand you are so nearly like ten thousand men i have seen to day that you couldn t be picked out from them if it weren t for your laundry marks camembert finished william what s that oh you ve still got your hammer out for new york have you well little old noisyville on the subway is good enough for me it s giving me mine and say i used to think the west was the whole round world only slightly flattened at the poles whenever bryan ran i used to yell myself hoarse about the free expense and hang my hat on the horizon and say cutting things in the grocery to little soap drummers from the east but i d never seen new york then jack me for it from the rathskellers up sixth avenue is the west to me now have you heard this fellow crusoe sing the desert isle for him i say but my wife made me go give me may irwin or e s willard any time poor billy said the artist delicately fingering a cigarette you remember when we were on our way to the east how we talked about this great wonderful city and how we meant to conquer it and never let it get the best of us we were going to be just the same fellows we had always been and never let it master us it has downed you old man you have changed from a maverick into a butterick don t see exactly what you are driving at said william i don t wear an alpaca coat with blue trousers and a seersucker vest on dress occasions like i used to do at home you talk about being cut to a pattern well ain t the pattern all right when you re in rome you ve got to do as the dagoes do this town seems to me to have other alleged metropolises skinned to flag stations according to the railroad schedule i ve got in mind chicago and saint jo and paris france are asterisk stops which means you wave a red flag and get on every other tuesday i like this little suburb of tarrytown on the hudson there s something or somebody doing all the time i m clearing a year selling automatic pumps and i m living like kings up why yesterday i was introduced to john w gates i took an auto ride with a wine agent s sister i saw two men run over by a street car and i seen edna may play in the evening talk about the west why the other night i woke everybody up in the hotel hollaring i dreamed i was walking on a board sidewalk in oshkosh what have you got against this town jack there s only one thing in it that i don t care for and that s a ferryboat the artist gazed dreamily at the cartridge paper on the wall this town said he is a leech it drains the blood of the country whoever comes to it accepts a challenge to a duel abandoning the figure of the leech it is a juggernaut a moloch a monster to which the innocence the genius and the beauty of the land must pay tribute hand to hand every newcomer must struggle with the leviathan you ve lost billy it shall never conquer me i hate it as one hates sin or pestilence or the color work in a ten cent magazine i despise its very vastness and power it has the poorest millionaires the littlest great men the lowest skyscrapers the dolefulest pleasures of any town i ever saw it has caught you old man but i will never run beside its chariot wheels it glosses itself as the chinaman glosses his collars give me the domestic finish i could stand a town ruled by wealth or one ruled by an aristocracy but this is one controlled by its lowest ingredients claiming culture it is the crudest asseverating its pre eminence it is the basest denying all outside values and virtue it is the narrowest give me the pure and the open heart of the west country i would go back there to morrow if i could don t you like this filet mignon said william shucks now what s the use to knock the town it s the greatest ever i couldn t sell one automatic pump between harrisburg and tommy o keefe s saloon in sacramento where i sell twenty here and have you seen sara bernardt in andrew mack yet the town s got you billy said jack all right said william i m going to buy a cottage on lake ronkonkoma next summer at midnight jack raised his window and sat close to it he caught his breath at what he saw though he had seen and felt it a hundred times far below and around lay the city like a ragged purple dream the irregular houses were like the broken exteriors of cliffs lining deep gulches and winding streams some were mountainous some lay in long desert ca ons such was the background of the wonderful cruel enchanting bewildering fatal great city but into this background were cut myriads of brilliant parallelograms and circles and squares through which glowed many colored lights and out of the violet and purple depths ascended like the city s soul sounds and odors and thrills that make up the civic body there arose the breath of gaiety unrestrained of love of hate of all the passions that man can know there below him lay all things good or bad that can be brought from the four corners of the earth to instruct please thrill enrich despoil elevate cast down nurture or kill thus the flavor of it came up to him and went into his blood there was a knock on his door a telegram had come for him it came from the west and these were its words come back and the answer will be yes dolly he kept the boy waiting ten minutes and then wrote the reply impossible to leave here at present then he sat at the window again and let the city put its cup of mandragora to his lips again after all it isn t a story but i wanted to know which one of the heroes won the battle against the city so i went to a very learned friend and laid the case before him what he said was please don t bother me i have christmas presents to buy so there it rests and you will have to decide for yourself what you want night had fallen on that great and beautiful city known as bagdad on the subway and with the night came the enchanted glamour that belongs not to arabia alone in different masquerade the streets bazaars and walled houses of the occidental city of romance were filled with the same kind of folk that so much interested our interesting old friend the late mr h a rashid they wore clothes eleven hundred years nearer to the latest styles than h a saw in old bagdad but they were about the same people underneath with the eye of faith you could have seen the little hunchback sinbad the sailor fitbad the tailor the beautiful persian the one eyed calenders ali baba and forty robbers on every block and the barber and his six brothers and all the old arabian gang easily but let us revenue to our lamb chops old tom crowley was a caliph he had in preferred stocks and bonds with solid gold edges in these times to be called a caliph you must have money the old style caliph business as conducted by mr rashid is not safe if you hold up a person nowadays in a bazaar or a turkish bath or a side street and inquire into his private and personal affairs the police court ll get you old tom was tired of clubs theatres dinners friends music money and everything that s what makes a caliph you must get to despise everything that money can buy and then go out and try to want something that you can t pay for i ll take a little trot around town all by myself thought old tom and try if i can stir up anything new let s see it seems i ve read about a king or a cardiff giant or something in old times who used to go about with false whiskers on making persian dates with folks he hadn t been introduced to that don t listen like a bad idea i certainly have got a case of humdrumness and fatigue on for the ones i do know that old cardiff used to pick up cases of trouble as he ran upon em and give em gold sequins i think it was and make em marry or got em good government jobs now i d like something of that sort my money is as good as his was even if the magazines do ask me every month where i got it yes i guess i ll do a little cardiff business to night and see how it goes plainly dressed old tom crowley left his madison avenue palace and walked westward and then south as he stepped to the sidewalk fate who holds the ends of the strings in the central offices of all the enchanted cities pulled a thread and a young man twenty blocks away looked at a wall clock and then put on his coat james turner worked in one of those little hat cleaning establishments on sixth avenue in which a fire alarms rings when you push the door open and where they clean your hat while you wait two days james stood all day at an electric machine that turned hats around faster than the best brands of champagne ever could have done overlooking your mild impertinence in feeling a curiosity about the personal appearance of a stranger i will give you a modified description of him weight complexion hair and brain light height five feet six age about twenty three dressed in a suit of greenish blue serge pockets containing two keys and sixty three cents in change but do not misconjecture because this description sounds like a general alarm that james was either lost or a dead one allons james stood all day at his work his feet were tender and extremely susceptible to impositions being put upon or below them all day long they burned and smarted causing him much suffering and inconvenience but he was earning twelve dollars per week which he needed to support his feet whether his feet would support him or not james turner had his own conception of what happiness was just as you and i have ours your delight is to gad about the world in yachts and motor cars and to hurl ducats at wild fowl mine is to smoke a pipe at evenfall and watch a badger a rattlesnake and an owl go into their common prairie home one by one james turner s idea of bliss was different but it was his he would go directly to his boarding house when his day s work was done after his supper of small steak bessemer potatoes stooed not stewed apples and infusion of chicory he would ascend to his fifth floor back hall room then he would take off his shoes and socks place the soles of his burning feet against the cold bars of his iron bed and read clark russell s sea yarns the delicious relief of the cool metal applied to his smarting soles was his nightly joy his favorite novels never palled upon him the sea and the adventures of its navigators were his sole intellectual passion no millionaire was ever happier than james turner taking his ease when james left the hat cleaning shop he walked three blocks out of his way home to look over the goods of a second hand bookstall on the sidewalk stands he had more than once picked up a paper covered volume of clark russell at half price while he was bending with a scholarly stoop over the marked down miscellany of cast off literature old tom the caliph sauntered by his discerning eye made keen by twenty years experience in the manufacture of laundry soap save the wrappers recognized instantly the poor and discerning scholar a worthy object of his caliphanous mood he descended the two shallow stone steps that led from the sidewalk and addressed without hesitation the object of his designed munificence his first words were no worse than salutatory and tentative james turner looked up coldly with sartor resartus in one hand and a mad marriage in the other beat it said he i don t want to buy any coat hangers or town lots in hankipoo new jersey run along now and play with your teddy bear young man said the caliph ignoring the flippancy of the hat cleaner i observe that you are of a studious disposition learning is one of the finest things in the world i never had any of it worth mentioning but i admire to see it in others i come from the west where we imagine nothing but facts maybe i couldn t understand the poetry and allusions in them books you are picking over but i like to see somebody else seem to know what they mean i m worth about and i m getting richer every day i made the height of it manufacturing aunt patty s silver soap i invented the art of making it i experimented for three years before i got just the right quantity of chloride of sodium solution and caustic potash mixture to curdle properly and after i had taken some out of the soap business i made the rest in corn and wheat futures now you seem to have the literary and scholarly turn of character and i ll tell you what i ll do i ll pay for your education at the finest college in the world i ll pay the expense of your rummaging over europe and the art galleries and finally set you up in a good business you needn t make it soap if you have any objections i see by your clothes and frazzled necktie that you are mighty poor and you can t afford to turn down the offer well when do you want to begin the hat cleaner turned upon old tom the eye of the big city which is an eye expressive of cold and justifiable suspicion of judgment suspended as high as haman was hung of self preservation of challenge curiosity defiance cynicism and strange as you may think it of a childlike yearning for friendliness and fellowship that must be hidden when one walks among the stranger bands for in new bagdad one in order to survive must suspect whosoever sits dwells drinks rides walks or sleeps in the adjacent chair house booth seat path or room say mike said james turner what s your line anyway shoe laces i m not buying anything you better put an egg in your shoe and beat it before incidents occur to you you can t work off any fountain pens gold spectacles you found on the street or trust company certificate house clearings on me say do i look like i d climbed down one of them missing fire escapes at helicon hall what s vitiating you anyhow son said the caliph in his most harunish tones as i said i m worth i don t want to have it all put in my coffin when i die i want to do some good with it i seen you handling over these here volumes of literature and i thought i d keep you i ve give the missionary societies but what did i get out of it nothing but a receipt from the secretary now you are just the kind of young man i d like to take up and see what money could make of him volumes of clark russell were hard to find that evening at the old book shop and james turner s smarting and aching feet did not tend to improve his temper humble hat cleaner though he was he had a spirit equal to any caliph s say you old faker he said angrily be on your way i don t know what your game is unless you want change for a bogus bill well i don t carry that much around with me but i do carry a pretty fair left handed punch that you ll get if you don t move on you are a blamed impudent little gutter pup said the caliph then james delivered his self praised punch old tom seized him by the collar and kicked him thrice the hat cleaner rallied and clinched two bookstands were overturned and the books sent flying a copy came up took an arm of each and marched them to the nearest station house fighting and disorderly conduct said the cop to the sergeant three hundred dollars bail said the sergeant at once asseveratingly and inquiringly sixty three cents said james turner with a harsh laugh the caliph searched his pockets and collected small bills and change amounting to four dollars i am worth he said forty million dollars but lock em up ordered the sergeant in his cell james turner laid himself on his cot ruminating maybe he s got the money and maybe he ain t but if he has or he ain t what does he want to go round butting into other folks s business for when a man knows what he wants and can get it it s the same as to him then an idea came to him that brought a pleased look to his face he removed his socks drew his cot close to the door stretched himself out luxuriously and placed his tortured feet against the cold bars of the cell door something hard and bulky under the blankets of his cot gave one shoulder discomfort he reached under and drew out a paper covered volume by clark russell called a sailor s sweetheart he gave a great sigh of contentment presently to his cell came the doorman and said say kid that old gazabo that was pinched with you for scrapping seems to have been the goods after all he phoned to his friends and he s out at the desk now with a roll of yellowbacks as big as a pullman car pillow he wants to bail you and for you to come out and see him tell him i ain t in said james turner sixes and sevens the last of the troubadours inexorably sam galloway saddled his pony he was going away from the rancho altito at the end of a three months visit it is not to be expected that a guest should put up with wheat coffee and biscuits yellow streaked with saleratus for longer than that nick napoleon the big negro man cook had never been able to make good biscuits once before when nick was cooking at the willow ranch sam had been forced to fly from his cuisine after only a six weeks sojourn on sam s face was an expression of sorrow deepened with regret and slightly tempered by the patient forgiveness of a connoisseur who cannot be understood but very firmly and inexorably he buckled his saddle cinches looped his stake rope and hung it to his saddle horn tied his slicker and coat on the cantle and looped his quirt on his right wrist the merrydews householders of the rancho altito men women children and servants vassals visitors employes dogs and casual callers were grouped in the gallery of the ranch house all with faces set to the tune of melancholy and grief for as the coming of sam galloway to any ranch camp or cabin between the rivers frio or bravo del norte aroused joy so his departure caused mourning and distress and then during absolute silence except for the bumping of a hind elbow of a hound dog as he pursued a wicked flea sam tenderly and carefully tied his guitar across his saddle on top of his slicker and coat the guitar was in a green duck bag and if you catch the significance of it it explains sam sam galloway was the last of the troubadours of course you know about the troubadours the encyclopaedia says they flourished between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries what they flourished doesn t seem clear you may be pretty sure it wasn t a sword maybe it was a fiddlebow or a forkful of spaghetti or a lady s scarf anyhow sam galloway was one of em sam put on a martyred expression as he mounted his pony but the expression on his face was hilarious compared with the one on his pony s you see a pony gets to know his rider mighty well and it is not unlikely that cow ponies in pastures and at hitching racks had often guyed sam s pony for being ridden by a guitar player instead of by a rollicking cussing all wool cowboy no man is a hero to his saddle horse and even an escalator in a department store might be excused for tripping up a troubadour oh i know i m one and so are you you remember the stories you memorize and the card tricks you study and that little piece on the piano how does it go ti tum te tum ti tum those little arabian ten minute entertainments that you furnish when you go up to call on your rich aunt jane you should know that omnae personae in tres partes divisae sunt namely brons troubadours and workers barons have no inclination to read such folderol as this and workers have no time so i know you must be a troubadour and that you will understand sam galloway whether we sing act dance write lecture or paint we are only troubadours so let us make the worst of it the pony with the dante alighieri face guided by the pressure of sam s knees bore that wandering minstrel sixteen miles southeastward nature was in her most benignant mood league after league of delicate sweet flowerets made fragrant the gently undulating prairie the east wind tempered the spring warmth wool white clouds flying in from the mexican gull hindered the direct rays of the april sun sam sang songs as he rode under his pony s bridle he had tucked some sprigs of chaparral to keep away the deer flies thus crowned the long faced quadruped looked more dantesque than before and judging by his countenance seemed to think of beatrice straight as topography permitted sam rode to the sheep ranch of old man ellison a visit to a sheep ranch seemed to him desirable just then there had been too many people too much noise argument competition confusion at rancho altito he had never conferred upon old man ellison the favour of sojourning at his ranch but he knew he would be welcome the troubadour is his own passport everywhere the workers in the castle let down the drawbridge to him and the baron sets him at his left hand at table in the banquet hall there ladies smile upon him and applaud his songs and stories while the workers bring boars heads and flagons if the baron nods once or twice in his carved oaken chair he does not do it maliciously old man ellison welcomed the troubadour flatteringly he had often heard praises of sam galloway from other ranchmen who had been complimented by his visits but had never aspired to such an honour for his own humble barony i say barony because old man ellison was the last of the barons of course mr bulwer lytton lived too early to know him or he wouldn t have conferred that sobriquet upon warwick in life it is the duty and the function of the baron to provide work for the workers and lodging and shelter for the troubadours old man ellison was a shrunken old man with a short yellow white beard and a face lined and seamed by past and gone smiles his ranch was a little two room box house in a grove of hackberry trees in the lonesomest part of the sheep country his household consisted of a kiowa indian man cook four hounds a pet sheep and a half tamed coyote chained to a fence post he owned sheep which he ran on two sections of leased land and many thousands of acres neither leased nor owned three or four times a year some one who spoke his language would ride up to his gate and exchange a few bald ideas with him those were red letter days to old man ellison then in what illuminated embossed and gorgeously decorated capitals must have been written the day on which a troubadour a troubadour who according to the encyclopaedia should have flourished between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries drew rein at the gates of his baronial castle old man ellison s smiles came back and filled his wrinkles when he saw sam he hurried out of the house in his shuffling limping way to greet him hello mr ellison called sam cheerfully thought i d drop over and see you a while notice you ve had fine rains on your range they ought to make good grazing for your spring lambs well well well said old man ellison i m mighty glad to see you sam i never thought you d take the trouble to ride over to as out of the way an old ranch as this but you re mighty welcome light i ve got a sack of new oats in the kitchen shall i bring out a feed for your hoss oats for him said sam derisively no sir ee he s as fat as a pig now on grass he don t get rode enough to keep him in condition i ll just turn him in the horse pasture with a drag rope on if you don t mind i am positive that never during the eleventh and thirteenth centuries did baron troubadour and worker amalgamate as harmoniously as their parallels did that evening at old man ellison s sheep ranch the kiowa s biscuits were light and tasty and his coffee strong ineradicable hospitality and appreciation glowed on old man ellison s weather tanned face as for the troubadour he said to himself that he had stumbled upon pleasant places indeed a well cooked abundant meal a host whom his lightest attempt to entertain seemed to delight far beyond the merits of the exertion and the reposeful atmosphere that his sensitive soul at that time craved united to confer upon him a satisfaction and luxurious ease that he had seldom found on his

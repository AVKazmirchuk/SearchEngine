the seashore it was evident that the presidential advent would not be celebrated by unlimited rejoicing the tenth of november was the day set for the entrance into coralio of the gay company from the capital a narrow gauge railroad runs twenty miles into the interior from solitas the government party travels by carriage from san mateo to this road s terminal point and proceeds by train to solitas from here they march in grand procession to coralio where on the day of their coming festivities and ceremonies abound but this season saw an ominous dawning of the tenth of november although the rainy season was over the day seemed to hark back to reeking june a fine drizzle of rain fell all during the forenoon the procession entered coralio amid a strange silence president losada was an elderly man grizzly bearded with a considerable ratio of indian blood revealed in his cinnamon complexion his carriage headed the procession surrounded and guarded by captain cruz and his famous troop of one hundred light horse el ciento huilando colonel rocas followed with a regiment of the regular army the president s sharp beady eyes glanced about him for the expected demonstration of welcome but he faced a stolid indifferent array of citizens sightseers the anchurians are by birth and habit and they turned out to their last able bodied unit to witness the scene but they maintained an

a close double file of fours following them the rest of the officials of state the judges and distinguished military and social ornaments of public and private life as the band struck up and the

about its arrival a business firm does not go to war with a nation but it reminded senor espirition and others in those carriages that the vesuvius fruit company was undoubtedly carrying something up

their way bluff hearty and nonchalant through the crowd on the narrow sidewalk clad in white linen big debonair with an air of good humored authority they made conspicuous figures among the dark mass of unimposing anchurians as they penetrated to within a few yards of the steps of the casa morena looking easily above the heads of the crowd they perceived another that towered above the undersized

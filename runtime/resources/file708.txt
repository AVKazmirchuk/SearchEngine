mademoiselle the laughter filled the alley and trickled back into the court as strange a thing to enter there as sunlight itself mademoiselle was amused sidonie a wise echo added a sepulchral but faithful contralto the laughter of the two seemed at last to penetrate the candy man he fumbled with his horseshoe pin at length mademoiselle ex hausted turned her flushed beautiful face to the win dow candy man said she go away when i laugh sidonie pulls my hair i can but laugh while you remain there here is a note for mademoiselle said fe ice coming to the window in the room there is no justice said the candy man lift ing the handle of his cart and moving away three yards he moved and stopped loud shriek after shriek came from the window of mademoiselle quickly he ran back he heard a body thumping upon the floor and a sound as though heels beat alter nately upon it what is it be called sidonie s severe head came into the window mademoiselle is overcome by bad news she said one whom she loved with all her soul has gone you may have beard of him he is monsieur ives he sails across the ocean to morrow oh you men squaring the circle at the hazard of wearying you this tale of vehe ment emotions must be prefaced by a discourse on geometry nature moves in circles art in straight lines the natural is rounded the artificial is made up of angles a man lost in the snow wanders in spite of himself in perfect circles the city man s feet denaturalized by rectangular streets and floors carry him ever away from himself the round eyes of childhood typify innocence the narrowed line of the flirt s optic proves the in vasion of art the horizontal mouth is the mark of determined cunning who has not read nature s most spontaneous lyric in lips rounded for the candid kiss beauty is nature in perfection circularity is its chief attribute behold the full moon the enchant ing golf ball the domes of splendid temples the huckleberry pie the wedding ring the circus ring the ring for the waiter and the round of drinks on the other hand straight lines show that na ture has been deflected imagine venus s girdle transformed into a straight front when we begin to move in straight lines and turn sharp corners our natures begin to change the consequence is that nature being more adaptive than art tries to conform to its sterner regulations the result is often a rather curious product for in stance a prize chrysanthemum wood alcohol whis key a republican missouri cauliflower au gratin and a new yorker nature is lost quickest in a big city the cause is geometrical not moral the straight lines of its streets and architecture the rectangularity of its laws and social customs the undeviating pavements the hard severe depressing uncompromising rules of all its ways even of its recreation and sports coldly exhibit a sneering defiance of the curved line of nature wherefore it may be said that the big city has demonstrated the problem of squaring the circle and it may be added that this mathematical intro duction precedes an account of the fate of a kentucky feud that was imported to the city that has a habit of making its importations conform to its angles the feud began in the cumberland mountains be tween the folwell and the harkness families the first victim of the homespun vendetta was a possum dog belonging to bill harkness the harkness family evened up this dire loss by laying out the chief of the folwell clan the folwells were prompt at repartee they oiled up their squirrel rifles and made it feasible for bill harkness to follow his dog to a land where the possums come down when treed without the stroke of an ax the feud flourished for forty years harknesses were shot at the plough through their lamp lit cabin windows coming from camp meeting asleep in duello sober and otherwise singly and in family groups prepared and unprepared folwells had the branches of their family tree lopped off in similar ways as the traditions of their country prescribed and authorized by and by the pruning left but a single member of each family and then cal harkness probably reasoning that further pursuance of the controversy would give a too decided personal flavor to the feud suddenly disappeared from the relieved cumberlands baulking the avenging hand of sam the ultimate op posing folwell a year afterward sam folwell learned that his hereditary unsuppressed enemy was living in new york city sam turned over the big iron wash pot in the yard scraped off some of the soot which he mixed with lard and shined his boots with the com pound he put on his store clothes of butternut dyed black a white shirt and collar and packed a carpet sack with spartan lingerie he took his squirrel rifle from its hooks but put it back again with a sigh however ethical and plausible the habit might be in the cumberlands perhaps new york would not swallow his pose of hunting squirrels among the skyscrapers along broadway an ancient but reliable colt s revolver that he resurrected from a bureau drawer seemed to proclaim itself the pink of weapons for metropolitan adventure and vengeance this and a hunting knife in a leather sheath sam packed in the carpet sack as he started muleback for the lowland railroad station the last folwell turned in his saddle and looked grimly at the little cluster of white pine slabs in the clump of cedars that marked the folwell burying ground sam folwell arrived in new york in the night still moving and living in the free circles of nature he did not perceive the formidable pitiless restless fierce angles of the great city waiting in the dark

familiar from different coigns of view a pleasant note of singing in his ears reinforced his opinion high sweet holy carolling far and harmonious and uprising as of sanctified nuns at their responses at what hour did the sisters sing he tried to think was it six eight twelve tansey leaned his back against the limestone wall and wondered strange things followed the air was full of white fluttering pigeons that circled about and settled upon the convent wall the wall blossomed with a quantity of shining green eyes that blinked and peered at him from the solid masonry a pink classic nymph came from an excavation in the cavernous road and danced barefoot and airy upon the ragged flints the sky was traversed by a company of beribboned cats marching in stupendous aerial procession the noise of singing grew louder an illumination of unseasonable fireflies danced past and strange whispers came out of the dark without meaning or excuse without amazement tansey took note of these phenomena he was on some new plane of understanding though his mind seemed to him clear and indeed happily tranquil a desire for movement and exploration seized him he rose and turned into the black gash of street to his right for a time the high wall formed one of its boundaries but further on two rows of black windowed houses closed it in here was the city s quarter once given over to the spaniard here were still his forbidding abodes of concrete and adobe standing cold and indomitable against the century from the murky fissure the eye saw flung against the sky the tangled filigree of his moorish balconies through stone archways breaths of dead vault chilled air coughed upon him his feet struck jingling iron rings in staples stone buried for half a cycle along these paltry avenues had swaggered the arrogant don had caracoled and serenaded and blustered while the tomahawk and the pioneer s rifle were already uplifted to expel him from a continent and tansey stumbling through this old world dust looked up dark as it was and saw andalusian beauties glimmering on the balconies some of them were laughing and listening to the goblin music that still followed others harked fearfully through the night trying to catch the hoof beats of caballeros whose last echoes from those stones had died away a century ago those women were silent but tansey heard the jangle of horseless bridle bits the whirr of riderless rowels and now and then a muttered malediction in a foreign tongue but he was not frightened shadows nor shadows of sounds could daunt him afraid no afraid of mother peek afraid to face the girl of his heart afraid of tipsy captain peek nay nor of these apparitions nor of that spectral singing that always pursued him singing he would show them he lifted up a strong and untuneful voice when you hear them bells go tingalingling serving notice upon those mysterious agencies that if it should come to a face to face encounter there ll be a hot time in the old town to night how long tansey consumed in treading this haunted byway was not clear to him but in time he emerged into a more commodious avenue when within a few yards of the corner he perceived through a window that a small confectionary of mean appearance was set in the angle his same glance that estimated its meagre equipment its cheap soda water fountain and stock of tobacco and sweets took cognizance of captain peek within lighting a cigar at a swinging gaslight as tansey rounded the corner captain peek came out and they met vis a vis an exultant joy filled tansey when he found himself sustaining the encounter with implicit courage peek indeed he raised his hand and snapped his fingers loudly it was peek himself who quailed guiltily before the valiant mien of the drug clerk sharp surprise and a palpable fear bourgeoned upon the captain s face and verily that face was one to rather call up such expressions on the faces of others the face of a libidinous heathen idol small eyed with carven folds in the heavy jowls and a consuming pagan license in its expression in the gutter just beyond the store tansey saw a closed carriage standing with its back toward him and a motionless driver perched in his place why it s tansey exclaimed captain peek how are you tansey h have a cigar tansey why it s peek cried tansey jubilant at his own temerity what deviltry are you up to now peek back streets and a closed carriage fie peek there s no one in the carriage said the captain smoothly everybody out of it is in luck continued tansey aggressively i d love for you to know peek that i m not stuck on you you re a bottle nosed scoundrel why the little rat s drunk cried the captain joyfully only drunk and i thought he was on go home tansey and quit bothering grown persons on the street but just then a white clad figure sprang out of the carriage and a shrill voice katie s voice sliced the air sam sam help me sam tansey sprung toward her but captain peek interposed his bulky form wonder of wonders the whilom spiritless youth struck out with his right and the hulking captain went over in a swearing heap tansey flew to katie and took her in his arms like a conquering knight she raised her face and he kissed her violets electricity caramels champagne here was the attainment of a dream that brought no disenchantment oh sam cried katie when she could i knew you would come to rescue me what do you suppose the mean things were going to do with me have your picture taken said tansey wondering at the foolishness of his remark no they were going to eat me i heard them

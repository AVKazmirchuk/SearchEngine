love of it because he was quick tempered to avoid arrest for his own amusement any reason that came to his mind would suffice he had escaped capture because he could shoot five sixths of a second sooner than any sheriff or ranger in the service and because he rode a speckled roan horse that knew every cow path in the mesquite and pear thickets from san antonio to matamoras tonia perez the girl who loved the cisco kid was half carmen half madonna and the rest oh yes a woman who is half carmen and half madonna can always be something more the rest let us say was humming bird she lived in a grass roofed jacal near a little mexican settlement at the lone wolf crossing of the frio with her lived a father or grandfather a lineal aztec somewhat less than a thousand years old who herded a hundred goats and lived in a continuous drunken dream from drinking mescal back of the jacal a tremendous forest of bristling pear twenty feet high at its worst crowded almost to its door it was along the bewildering maze of this spinous thicket that the speckled roan would bring the kid to see his girl and once clinging like a lizard to the ridge pole high up under the peaked grass roof he had heard tonia with her madonna face and carmen beauty and humming bird soul parley with the sheriff s posse denying knowledge of her man in her soft melange of spanish and english one day the adjutant general of the state who is ex officio commander of the ranger forces wrote some sarcastic lines to captain duval of company x stationed at laredo relative to the serene and undisturbed existence led by murderers and desperadoes in the said captain s territory the captain turned the colour of brick dust under his tan and forwarded the letter after adding a few comments per ranger private bill adamson to ranger lieutenant sandridge camped at a water hole on the nueces with a squad of five men in preservation of law and order lieutenant sandridge turned a beautiful couleur de rose through his ordinary strawberry complexion tucked the letter in his hip pocket and chewed off the ends of his gamboge moustache the next morning he saddled his horse and rode alone to the mexican settlement at the lone wolf crossing of the frio twenty miles away six feet two blond as a viking quiet as a deacon dangerous as a machine gun sandridge moved among the jacales patiently seeking news of the cisco kid far more than the law the mexicans dreaded the cold and certain vengeance of the lone rider that the ranger sought it had been one of the kid s pastimes to shoot mexicans to see them kick if he demanded from them moribund terpsichorean feats simply that he might be entertained what terrible and extreme penalties would be certain to follow should they anger him one and all they lounged with upturned palms and shrugging shoulders filling the air with quien sabes and denials of the kid s acquaintance but there was a man named fink who kept a store at the crossing a man of many nationalities tongues interests and ways of thinking no use to ask them mexicans he said to sandridge they re afraid to tell this hombre they call the kid goodall is his name ain t it he s been in my store once or twice i have an idea you might run across him at but i guess i don t keer to say myself i m two seconds later in pulling a gun than i used to be and the difference is worth thinking about but this kid s got a half mexican girl at the crossing that he comes to see she lives in that jacal a hundred yards down the arroyo at the edge of the pear maybe she no i don t suppose she would but that jacal would be a good place to watch anyway sandridge rode down to the jacal of perez the sun was low and the broad shade of the great pear thicket already covered the grass thatched hut the goats were enclosed for the night in a brush corral near by a few kids walked the top of it nibbling the chaparral leaves the old mexican lay upon a blanket on the grass already in a stupor from his mescal and dreaming perhaps of the nights when he and pizarro touched glasses to their new world fortunes so old his wrinkled face seemed to proclaim him to be and in the door of the jacal stood tonia and lieutenant sandridge sat in his saddle staring at her like a gannet agape at a sailorman the cisco kid was a vain person as all eminent and successful assassins are and his bosom would have been ruffled had he known that at a simple exchange of glances two persons in whose minds he had been looming large suddenly abandoned at least for the time all thought of him never before had tonia seen such a man as this he seemed to be made of sunshine and blood red tissue and clear weather he seemed to illuminate the shadow of the pear when he smiled as though the sun were rising again the men she had known had been small and dark even the kid in spite of his achievements was a stripling no larger than herself with black straight hair and a cold marble face that chilled the noonday as for tonia though she sends description to the poorhouse let her make a millionaire of your fancy her blue black hair smoothly divided in the middle and bound close to her head and her large eyes full of the latin melancholy gave her the madonna touch her motions and air spoke of the concealed fire and the desire to charm that

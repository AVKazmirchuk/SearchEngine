a recent enactment of ethics along with race suicide and rural delivery listen says caligula and i ll explain the case set down in the papers here was a greek citizen named burdick harris says he captured for a graft by africans and the united states sends two gunboats to the state of tangiers and makes the king of morocco give up seventy thousand dollars to raisuli go slow says i that sounds too international to take in all at once it s like thimble thimble who s got the naturalization papers twas press despatches from constantinople says caligula you ll see six months from now they ll be confirmed by the monthly magazines and then it won t be long till you ll notice em alongside the photos of the mount pelee eruption photos in the while you get your hair cut weeklies it s all right pick this african man raisuli hides burdick harris up in the mountains and advertises his price to the governments of different nations now you wouldn t think for a minute goes on caligula that john hay would have chipped in and helped this graft along if it wasn t a square game would you why no says i i ve always stood right in with bryan s policies and i couldn t consciously say a word against the republican administration just now but if harris was a greek on what system of international protocols did hay interfere it ain t exactly set forth in the papers says caligula i suppose it s a matter of sentiment you know he wrote this poem little breeches and them greeks wear little or none but anyhow john hay sends the brooklyn and the olympia over and they cover africa with thirty inch guns and then hay cables after the health of the persona grata and how are they this morning he wires is burdick harris alive yet or mr raisuli dead and the king of morocco sends up the seventy thousand dollars and they turn burdick harris loose and there s not half the hard feelings among the nations about this little kidnapping matter as there was about the peace congress and burdick harris says to the reporters in the greek language that he s often heard about the united states and he admires roosevelt next to raisuli who is one of the whitest and most gentlemanly kidnappers that he ever worked alongside of so you see pick winds up caligula we ve got the law of nations on our side we ll cut this colonel man out of the herd and corral him in them little mountains and stick up his heirs and assigns for ten thousand dollars well you seldom little red headed territorial terror i answers you can t bluff your uncle tecumseh pickens i ll be your company in this graft but i misdoubt if you ve absorbed the inwardness of this burdick harris case calig and if on any morning we get a telegram from the secretary of state asking about the health of the scheme i propose to acquire the most propinquitous and celeritous mule in this section and gallop diplomatically over into the neighboring and peaceful nation of alabama iii me and caligula spent the next three days investigating the bunch of mountains into which we proposed to kidnap colonel jackson t rockingham we finally selected an upright slice of topography covered with bushes and trees that you could only reach by a secret path that we cut out up the side of it and the only way to reach the mountain was to follow up the bend of a branch that wound among the elevations then i took in hand an important subdivision of the proceedings i went up to atlanta on the train and laid in a two hundred and fifty dollar supply of the most gratifying and efficient lines of grub that money could buy i always was an admirer of viands in their more palliative and revised stages hog and hominy are not only inartistic to my stomach but they give indigestion to my moral sentiments and i thought of colonel jackson t rockingham president of the sunrise edenville tap railroad and how he would miss the luxury of his home fare as is so famous among wealthy southerners so i sunk half of mine and caligula s capital in as elegant a layout of fresh and canned provisions as burdick harris or any other professional kidnappee ever saw in a camp i put another hundred in a couple of cases of bordeaux two quarts of cognac two hundred havana regalias with gold bands and a camp stove and stools and folding cots i wanted colonel rockingham to be comfortable and i hoped after he gave up the ten thousand dollars he would give me and caligula as good a name for gentlemen and entertainers as the greek man did the friend of his that made the united states his bill collector against africa when the goods came down from atlanta we hired a wagon moved them up on the little mountain and established camp and then we laid for the colonel we caught him one morning about two miles out from mountain valley on his way to look after some of his burnt umber farm land he was an elegant old gentleman as thin and tall as a trout rod with frazzled shirt cuffs and specs on a black string we explained to him brief and easy what we wanted and caligula showed him careless the handle of his forty five under his coat what says colonel rockingham bandits in perry county georgia i shall see that the board of immigration and public improvements hears of this be so unfoolhardy as to climb into that buggy says caligula by order of the board of perforation and public depravity this is a business meeting and we re anxious to adjourn sine qua non we

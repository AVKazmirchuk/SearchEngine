see texas texas he walked to a large wall map of the united states and placing his finger thereon at about the location of idaho ran it down in a zigzag doubtful way until he reached texas oh yes here it is i have so many things on my mind i sometimes forget what i should know well let s see texas oh yes that s the state where ida wells and a lot of colored people lynched a socialist named hogg for raising a riot at a camp meeting so you are from texas i know a man from texas named dave culberson how is dave and his family has dave got any children he has a boy in austin i said working around the capitol who is president of texas now i don t exactly oh excuse me i forgot again i thought i heard some talk of its having been made a republic again now mr cleveland i said you answer some of my questions a curious film came over the president s eyes he sat stiffly in his chair like an automaton proceed he said what do you think of the political future of this country i will state that political exigencies demand emergentistical promptitude and while the united states is indissoluble in conception and invisible in intent treason and internecine disagreement have ruptured the consanguinity of patriotism and one moment mr president i interrupted would you mind changing that cylinder i could have gotten all that from the american press association if i had wanted plate matter do you wear flannels what is your favorite poet brand of catsup bird flower and what are you going to do when you are out of a job young man said mr cleveland sternly you are going a little too far my private affairs do not concern the public i begged his pardon and he recovered his good humor in a moment you texans have a great representative in senator mills he said i think the greatest two speeches i ever heard were his address before the senate advocating the removal of the tariff on salt and increasing it on chloride of sodium tom ochiltree is also from our state i said oh no he isn t you must be mistaken replied mr cleveland for he says he is i really must go down to texas some time and see the state i want to go up into the panhandle and see if it is really shaped like it is on the map well i must be going said i when you get back to texas said the president rising you must write to me your visit has awakened in me quite an interest in your state which i fear i have not given the attention it deserves there are many historical and otherwise interesting places that you have revived in my recollection the alamo where davy jones fell goliad sam houston s surrender to montezuma the petrified boom found near austin five cent cotton and the siamese democratic platform born in dallas i should so much like to see the gals in galveston and go to the wake in waco i am glad i met you turn to the left as you enter the hall and keep straight on out i made a low bow to signify that the interview was at an end and withdrew immiediately i had no difficulty in leaving the building as soon as i was outside i hurried downtown in order to obtain refreshments at some place where viands had been placed upon the free list i shall not describe my journey back to austin i lost my return ticket somewhere in the white house and was forced to return home in a manner not especially beneficial to my shoes everybody was well in washington when i left and all send their love an unfinished christmas story probably begun several years before his death published as it here appears in short stories january now a christmas story should be one for a good many years the ingenious writers have been putting forth tales for the holiday numbers that employed every subtle evasive indirect and strategic scheme they could invent to disguise the christmas flavor so far has this new practice been carried that nowadays when you read a story in a holiday magazine the only way you can tell it is a christmas story is to look at the footnote which reads the incidents in the above story happened on december th ed there is progress in this but it is all very sad there are just as many real christmas stories as ever if we would only dig em up me i am for the scrooge and marley christmas story and the annie and willie s prayer poem and the long lost son coming home on the stroke of twelve to the poorly thatched cottage with his arms full of talking dolls and popcorn balls and zip you hear the second mortgage on the cottage go flying off it into the deep snow so this is to warn you that there is no subterfuge about this story and you might come upon stockings hung to the mantel and plum puddings and hark the chimes and wealthy misers loosening up and handing over penny whistles to lame newsboys if you read further once i knocked at a door i have so many things to tell you i keep on losing sight of the story it was the front door of a furnished room house in west teenth street i was looking for a young illustrator named paley originally and irrevocably from terre haute paley doesn t enter even into the first serial rights of this christmas story i mention him simply in explaining why i came to knock at the door some people have so much curiosity the door was opened by the landlady i had seen hundreds like her and i had smelled before that cold dank furnished draught of air that hurried by her to escape immurement in the furnished house she was stout and her face and lands were as white as though she had been drowned in a barrel of vinegar one hand held together at her throat a buttonless flannel dressing sacque whose lines had been cut by no tape or butterick known to mortal woman beneath this a too long flowered black sateen skirt was draped about her reaching the floor in stiff wrinkles and folds the rest of her was yellow her hair in some bygone age had been dipped in the fountain of folly presided over by the merry nymph hydrogen but now except at the roots it had returned to its natural grim and grizzled white her eyes and teeth and finger nails were yellow her chops hung low and shook when she moved the look on her face was exactly that smileless look of fatal melancholy that you may have seen on the countenance of a hound left sitting on the doorstep of a deserted cabin i inquired for paley after a long look of cold suspicion the landlady spoke and her voice matched the dingy roughness of her flannel sacque paley was i sure that was the name and wasn t it likely mr sanderson i meant in the third floor rear no it was paley i wanted again that frozen shrewd steady study of my soul from her pale yellow unwinking eyes trying to penetrate my mask of deception and rout out my true motives from my lying lips there was a mr tompkins in the front hall bedroom two flights up perhaps it was he i was seeking he worked of nights he never came in till seven in the morning or if it was really mr tucker thinly disguised as paley that i was hunting i would have to call between five and but no i held firmly to paley there was no such name among her lodgers click the door closed swiftly in my face and i heard through the panels the clanking of chains and bolts i went down the steps and stopped to consider the number of this house was i was sure paley had said or perhaps it was or i decided to try the second house farther along i rang the bell the door opened and there stood the same woman i wasn t confronted by just a resemblance it was the same woman holding together the same old sacque at her throat and looking at me with the same yellow eyes as if she had never seen me before on earth i saw on the knuckle of her second finger the same red and black spot made probably by a recent burn against a hot stove i stood speechless and gaping while one with moderate haste might have told fifty i couldn t have spoken paley s name even if i had remembered it i did the only thing that a brave man who believes there are mysterious forces in nature that we do not yet fully comprehend could have done in the circumstances i backed down the steps to the sidewalk and then hurried away frontward fully understanding how incidents like that must bother the psychical research people and the census takers of course i heard an explanation of it afterward as we always do about inexplicable things the landlady was mrs kannon and she leased three adjoining houses which she made into one by cutting arched doorways through the walls she sat in the middle house and answered the three bells i wonder why i have maundered so slowly through the prologue i have it it was simply to say to you in the form of introduction rife through the middle west shake hands with mrs kannon for it was in her triple house that the christmas story happened and it was there where i picked up the incontrovertible facts from the gossip of many roomers and met stickney and saw the necktie christmas came that year on thursday and snow came with it stickney harry clarence fowler stickney to whomsoever his full baptismal cognominal burdens may be of interest reached his address at six thirty wednesday afternoon address is new yorkese for home stickney roomed at west teenth street third floor rear hall room he was twenty years and four months old and he worked in a cameras of all kinds photographic supplies and films developed store i don t know what kind of work he did in the store but you must have seen him he is the young man who always comes behind the counter to wait on you and lets you talk for five minutes telling him what you want when you are done he calls the proprietor at the top of his voice to wait on you and walks away whistling between his teeth i don t want to bother about describing to you his appearance but if you are a man reader i will say that stickncy looked precisely like the young chap that you always find sitting in your chair smoking a cigarette after you have missed a shot while playing pool not billiards but pool when you want to sit down yourself there are some to whom christmas gives no christmassy essence of course prosperous people and comfortable people who have homes or flats or rooms with meals and even people who live in apartment houses with hotel service get something of the christmas flavor they give one another presents with the cost mark scratched off with a penknife and they hang holly wreaths in the front windows and when they are asked whether they prefer light or dark meat from the turkey they say both please and giggle and have lots of fun and the very poorest people have the best time of it the army gives em a dinner and the a m issue of the night final edition of the newspaper with the largest circulation in the city leaves a basket at their door full of an apple a lake ronkonkoma squab a scrambled eggplant and a bunch of kalamazoo bleached parsley the poorer you are the more christmas does for you but i ll tell you to what kind of a mortal christmas seems to be only the day before the twenty sixth day of december it s the chap in the big city earning sixteen dollars a week with no friends and few acquaintances who finds himself with only fifty cents in his pocket on christmas eve he can t accept charity he can t borrow he knows no one who would invite him to dinner i have a fancy that when the shepherds left their flocks to follow the star of bethlehem there was a bandy legged young fellow among them who was just learning the sheep business so they said to him bobby we re going to investigate this star route and see what s in it if it should turn out to be the first christmas day we don t want to miss it and as you are not a wise man and as you couldn t possibly purchase a present to take along suppose you stay behind and mind the sheep so as we may say harry stickney was a direct descendant of the shepherd who was left behind to take care of the flocks getting back to facts stickney rang the doorbell of he had a habit of forgetting his latchkey instantly the door opened and there stood mrs kannon clutching her sacque together at the throat and gorgonizing him with her opaque yellow eyes to give you good measure here is a story within a story once a roomer in who had the scotch habit not kilts but a habit of drinking scotch began to figure to himself what might happen if two persons should ring the doorbells of and at the same time visions of two halves of mrs kannon appearing respectively and simultaneously at the two entrances each clutching at a side of an open flapping sacque that could never meet overpowered him bellevue got him evening said stickney cheerlessly as he distributed little piles of muddy slush along the hall matting think we ll have snow you left your key said here the manuscript ends the unprofitable servant left unfinished and published as it here appears in everybody s magazine december i am the richer by the acquaintance of four newspaper men singly they are my encyclopedias friends mentors and sometimes bankers but now and then it happens that all of them will pitch upon the same printworthy incident of the passing earthly panorama and will send in reportorial constructions thereof to their respective journals it is then that for me it is to laugh for it seems that to each of them trained and skilled as he may be the same occurrence presents a different facet of the cut diamond life one will have it let us say that mme andre macarte s apartment was looted by six burglars who descended via the fire escape and bore away a ruby tiara valued at two thousand dollars and a five hundred dollar prize spitz dog which in violation of the expectoration ordinance was making free with the halls of the wuttapesituckquesunoowetunquah apartments my second chiel will take notes to the effect that while a friendly game of pinochle was in progress in the tenement rooms of mrs andy mccarty a lady guest named ruby o hara threw a burglar down six flights of stairs where he was pinioned and held by a two thousand dollar english bulldog amid a crowd of five hundred excited spectators my third chronicler and friend will gather the news threads of the happening in his own happy way setting forth on the page for you to read that the house of antonio macartini was blown up at a m by the black hand society on his refusing to leave two thousand dollars at a certain street corner killing a pet five hundred dollar pomeranian belonging to alderman rubitara s little daughter see photo and diagram opposite number four of my history makers will simply construe from the premises the story that while an audience of two thousand enthusiasts was listening to a rubinstein concert on sixth street a woman who said she was mrs andrew m carter threw a brick through a plate glass window valued at five hundred dollars the carter woman claimed that some one in the building had stolen her dog now the discrepancies in these registrations of the day s doings need do no one hurt surely one newspaper is enough for any man to prop against his morning water bottle to fend off the smiling hatred of his wife s glance if he be foolish enough to read four he is no wiser than a higher critic i remember probably as well as you do having read the parable of the talents a prominent citizen about to journey into a far country first hands over to his servants his goods to one he gives five talents to another two to another one to every man according to his several ability as the text has it there are two versions of this parable as you well know there may be more i do not know when the p c returns he requires an accounting two servants have put their talents out at usury and gained one hundred per cent good the unprofitable one simply digs up the talent deposited with him and hands it out on demand a pattern of behavior for trust companies and banks surely in one version we read that he had wrapped it in a napkin and laid it away but the commentator informs us that the talent mentioned was composed of ounces of silver about worth so the chronicler who mentioned the napkin had either to reduce the amount of the deposit or do a lot of explaining about the size of the napery used in those davs therefore in his version we note that he uses the word pound instead of talent a pound of silver may very well be laid away and carried away in a napkin as any hotel or restaurant man will tell you but let us get away from our mutton when the returned nobleman finds that the one talented servant has nothing to hand over except the original fund entrusted to him he is as angry as a multi millionaire would be if some one should hide under his bed and make a noise like an assessment he orders the unprofitable servant cast into outer darkness after first taking away his talent and giving it to the one hundred per cent financier and breathing strange saws saying from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath which is the same as to say nothing from nothing leaves nothing and now closer draw the threads of parable precept allegory and narrative leading nowhere if you will or else weaving themselves into the little fiction story about cliff mcgowan and his one talent there is but a definition to follow and then the homely actors trip on talent a gift endowment or faculty some peculiar ability power or accomplishment natural or acquired a metaphor borrowed from the parable in matt xxv l in new york city to day there are estimated living creatures training for the stage this does not include seals pigs dogs elephants prize fighters carmens mind readers or japanese wrestlers the bulk of them are in the ranks of the four million out of this number will survive a thousand nine hundred of these will have attained their fulness of fame when they shall dubiously indicate with the point of a hatpin a blurred figure in a flashlight photograph of a stage tout ensemble with the proud commentary that s me eighty in the pinkest of male louis xiv court costumes shall welcome the queen of the mythical pawpaw isles in a few well memorized words turning a tip tilted nose upon the nine hundred ten in tiny lace caps shall dust ibsen furniture for six minutes after the rising of the curtain nine shall attain the circuits besieging with muscle skill eye hand voice wit brain heel and toe the ultimate high walls of stardom one shall inherit broadway sic venit gloria mundi cliff mcgowan and mac mcgowan were cousins they lived on the west side and were talented singing dancing imitations trick bicycle riding boxing german and irish dialect comedy and a little sleight of hand and balancing of wheat straws and wheelbarrows on the ends of their chins came as easy to them as it is for you to fix your rat so it won t show or to dodge a creditor through the swinging doors of a well lighted cafe according as you may belong to the one or the other division of the greatest prestidigitators the people they were slim pale consummately self possessed youths whose fingernails were always irreproachably and clothes seams reproachfully shiny their conversation was in sentences so short that they made kipling s seem as long as court citations having the temperament they did no work any afternoon you could find them on eighth avenue either in front of spinelli s barber shop mike dugan s place or the limerick hotel rubbing their forefinger nails with dingy silk handkerchiefs at any time if you had happened to be standing undecisive near a pool table and cliff and mac had casually as it were drawn near mentioning something disinterestedly about a game well indeed would it have been for you had you gone your way unresponsive which assertion carefully considered is a study in tense punctuation and advice to strangers of all kinships it is likely that the closest is that of cousin between cousins there exist the ties of race name and favor ties thicker than water and yet not coagulated with the jealous precipitations of brotherhood or the enjoining obligations of the matrimonial yoke you can bestow upon a cousin almost the interest and affection that you would give to a stranger you need not feel toward him the contempt and embarrassment that you have for one of your father s sons it is the closer clan feeling that sometimes makes the branch of a tree stronger than its trunk thus were the two mcgowans bonded they enjoyed a quiet celebrity in their district which was a strip west of eighth avenue with the pump for its pivot their talents were praised in a hundred joints their friendship was famed even in a neighborhood where men had been known to fight off the wives of their friends when domestic onslaught was being made upon their friends by the wives of their friends thus do the limitations of english force us to repetends so side by side grim sallow lowering inseparable undefeated the cousins fought their way into the temple of art art with a big a which causes to intervene a lesson in geometry one night at about eleven o clock del delano dropped into mike s place on eighth avenue from that moment instead of remaining a place the cafe became a resort it was as though king edward had condescended to mingle with ten spots of a different suit or joe gans had casually strolled in to look over the tuskegee school or mr shaw of england had accepted an invitation to read selections from rena the snow bird at an unveiling of the proposed monument to james owen o connor at chinquapin falls mississippi in spite of these comparisons you will have to be told why the patronizing of a third rate saloon on the west side by the said del delano conferred such a specific honor upon the place del delano could not make his feet behave and so the world paid him a week to see them misconduct themselves on the vaudeville stage to make the matter plain to you and to swell the number of words he was the best fancy dancer on any of the circuits between ottawa and corpus christi with his eyes fixed on vacancy and his feet apparently fixed on nothing he nightly charmed thousands as his press agent incorrectly stated even taking night performance and matinee together he scarcely could have charmed more than eighteen hundred including those who left after zora the nautch girl had squeezed herself through a hoop twelve inches in diameter and those who were waiting for the moving pictures but del delano was the west side s favorite and nowhere is there a more loyal side five years before our story was submitted to the editors del had crawled from some tenth avenue basement like a lean rat and had bitten his way into the big cheese patched half starved cuffless and as scornful of the hook as an interpreter of ibsen he had danced his way into health as you and i view it and fame in sixteen minutes on amateur night at creary s variety theatre in eighth avenue a bookmaker one of the kind that talent wins with instead of losing sat in the audience asleep dreaming of an impossible pick up among the amateurs after a snore a glass of beer from the handsome waiter and a temporary blindness caused by the diamonds of a transmontane blonde in box e the bookmaker woke up long enough to engage del delano for a three weeks trial engagement fused with a trained dog short circuit covering the three washingtons heights statue and square by the time this story was read and accepted del delano was drawing his three hundred dollars a week which divided by seven sunday acts not in costume being permissible dispels the delusion entertained by most of us that we have seen better days you can easily imagine the worshipful agitation of eighth avenue whenever del delano honored it with a visit after his terpsichorean act in a historically great and vilely ventilated broadway theatre if the west side could claim forty two minutes out of his forty two weeks bookings every year it was an occasion for bonfires and repainting of the pump and now you know why mike s saloon is a resort and no longer a simple place del delano entered mike s alone so nearly concealed in a fur lined overcoat and a derby two sizes too large for him was prince lightfoot that you saw of his face only his pale hatchet edged features and a pair of unwinking cold light blue eyes nearly every man lounging at mike s bar recognized the renowned product of the west side to those who did not wisdom was conveyed by prodding elbows and growls of one sided introduction upon charley one of the bartenders both fame and fortune descended simultaneously he had once been honored by shaking hands with the great delano at a seventh avenue boxing bout so with lungs of brass he now cried hallo del old man what ll it be mike the proprietor who was cranking the cash register heard on the next day he raised charley s wages five a week del delano drank a pony beer paying for it carelessly out of his nightly earnings of and c he nodded amiably but coldly at the long line of mike s patrons and strolled past then into the rear room of the cafe for he heard in there sounds pertaining to his own art the light stirring staccato of a buck and wing dance in the back room mac mcgowan was giving a private exhibition of the genius of his feet a few young men sat at tables looking on critically while they amused themselves seriously with beer they nodded approval at some new fancy steps of mac s own invention at the sight of the great del delano the amateur s feet stuttered blundered clicked a few times and ceased to move the tongues of one s shoes become tied in the presence of the master mac s sallow face took on a slight flush from the uncertain cavity between del delano s hat brim and the lapels of his high fur coat collar came a thin puff of cigarette smoke and then a voice do that last step over again kid and don t hold your arms quite so stiff now then once more mac went through his paces according to the traditions of the man dancer his entire being was transformed into mere feet and legs his gaze and expression became cataleptic his body unbending above the waist but as light as a cork bobbed like the same cork dancing on the ripples of a running brook the beat of his heels and toes pleased you like a snare drum obligato the performance ended with an amazing clatter of leather against wood that culminated in a sudden flat footed stamp leaving the dancer erect and as motionless as a pillar of the colonial portico of a mansion in a kentucky prohibition town mac felt that he had done his best and that del delano would turn his back upon him in derisive scorn an approximate silence followed broken only by the mewing of a cafe cat and the hubbub and uproar of a few million citizens and transportation facilities outside mac turned a hopeless but nervy eye upon del delano s face in it he read disgust admiration envy indifference approval disappointment praise and contempt thus in the countenances of those we hate or love we find what we most desire or fear to see which is an assertion equalling in its wisdom and chiaroscuro the most famous sayings of the most foolish philosophers that the world has ever known del delano retired within his overcoat and hat in two minutes he emerged and turned his left side to mac then he spoke you ve got a foot movement kid like a baby hippopotamus trying to side step a jab from a humming bird and you hold yourself like a truck driver having his picture taken in a third avenue photograph gallery and you haven t got any method or style and your knees are about as limber as a couple of yale pass keys and you strike the eye as weighing let us say pounds while you work but say would you mind giving me your name mcgowan said the humbled amateur mac mcgowan delano the great slowly lighted a cigarette and continued through its smoke in other words you re rotten you can t dance but i ll tell you one thing you ve got throw it all off of your system while you re at it said mac what ve i got genius said del delano except myself it s up to you to be the best fancy dancer in the united states europe asia and the colonial possessions of all three smoke up said mac mcgowan genius repeated the master you ve got a talent for genius your brains are in your feet where a dancer s ought to be you ve been self taught until you re almost ruined but not quite what you need is a trainer i ll take you in hand and put you at the top of the profession there s room there for the two of us you may beat me said the master casting upon him a cold savage look combining so much rivalry affection justice and human hate that it stamped him at once as one of the little great ones of the earth you may beat me but i doubt it i ve got the start and the pull but at the top is where you belong your name you say is robinson mcgowan repeated the amateur mac mcgowan it don t matter said delano suppose you walk up to my hotel with me i d like to talk to you your footwork is the worst i ever saw madigan but well i d like to talk to you you may not think so but i m not so stuck up i came off of the west side myself that overcoat cost me eight hundred dollars but the collar ain t so high but what i can see over it i taught myself to dance and i put in most of nine years at it before i shook a foot in public but i had genius i didn t go too far wrong in teaching myself as you ve done you ve got the rottenest method and style of anybody i ever saw oh i don t think much of the few little steps i take said mac with hypocritical lightness don t talk like a package of self raising buckwheat flour said del delano you ve had a talent handed to you by the proposition higher up and it s up to you to do the proper thing with it i d like to have you go up to my hotel for a talk if you will in his rooms in the king clovis hotel del delano put on a scarlet house coat bordered with gold braid and set out apollinaris and a box of sweet crackers mac s eye wandered forget it said del drink and tobacco may be all right for a man who makes his living with his hands but they won t do if you re depending on your head or your feet if one end of you gets tangled so does the other that s why beer and cigarettes don t hurt piano players and picture painters but you ve got to cut em out if you want to do mental or pedal work now have a cracker and then we ll talk some all right said mac i take it as an honor of course for you to notice my hopping around of course i d like to do something in a professional line of course i can sing a little and do card tricks and irish and german comedy stuff and of course i m not so bad on the trapeze and comic bicycle stunts and hebrew monologues and one moment interrupted del delano before we begin i said you couldn t dance well that wasn t quite right you ve only got two or three bad tricks in your method you re handy with your feet and you belong at the top where i am i ll put you there i ve got six weeks continuous in new york and in four i can shape up your style till the booking agents will fight one another to get you and i ll do it too i m of from and for the west side del delano looks good on bill boards but the family name s crowley now mackintosh mcgowan i mean you ve got your chance fifty times a better one than i had i d be a shine to turn it down said mac and i hope you understand i appreciate it me and my cousin cliff mcgowan was thinking of getting a try out at creary s on amateur night a month from to morrow good stuff said delano i got mine there junius t rollins the booker for kuhn dooley jumped on the stage and engaged me after my dance and the boards were an inch deep in nickels and dimes and quarters there wasn t but nine penny pieces found in the lot i ought to tell you said mac after two minutes of pensiveness that my cousin cliff can beat me dancing we ve always been what you might call pals if you d take him up instead of me now it might be better he s invented a lot of steps that i can t cut forget it said delano mondays wednesdays fridays and saturdays of every week from now till amateur night a month off i ll coach you i ll make you as good as i am and nobody could do more for you my act s over every night at half an hour later i ll take you up and drill you till twelve i ll put you at the top of the bunch right where i am you ve got talent your style s bum but you ve got the genius you let me manage it i m from the west side myself and i d rather see one of the same gang win out before i would an east sider or any of the flatbush or hackensack meadow kind of butt iners i ll see that junius rollins is present on your friday night and if he don t climb over the footlights and offer you fifty a week as a starter i ll let you draw it down from my own salary every monday night now am i talking on the level or am i not amateur night at creary s eighth avenue theatre is cut by the same pattern as amateur nights elsewhere after the regular performance the humblest talent may by previous arrangement with the management make its debut upon the public stage ambitious non professionals mostly self instructed display their skill and powers of entertainment along the broadest lines they may sing dance mimic juggle contort recite or disport themselves along any of the ragged boundary lines of art from the ranks of these anxious tyros are chosen the professionals that adorn or otherwise make conspicuous the full blown stage press agents delight in recounting to open mouthed and close eared reporters stories of the humble beginnings of the brilliant stars whose orbits they control such and such a prima donna they will tell you made her initial bow to the public while turning handsprings on an amateur night one great matinee favorite made his debut on a generous friday evening singing coon songs of his own composition a tragedian famous on two continents and an island first attracted attention by an amateur impersonation of a newly landed scandinavian peasant girl one broadway comedian that turns em away got a booking on a friday night by reciting seriously the graveyard scene in hamlet thus they get their chance amateur night is a kindly boon it is charity divested of almsgiving it is a brotherly hand reached down by members of the best united band of coworkers in the world to raise up less fortunate ones without labelling them beggars it gives you the chance if you can grasp it to step for a few minutes before some badly painted scenery and during the playing by the orchestra of some ten or twelve bars of music and while the soles of your shoes may be clearly holding to the uppers to secure a salary equal to a congressman s or any orthodox minister s could an ambitious student of literature or financial methods get a chance like that by spending twenty minutes in a carnegie library i do not not trow so but shall we look in at creary s let us say that the specific friday night had arrived on which the fortunate mac mcgowan was to justify the flattering predictions of his distinguished patron and incidentally drop his silver talent into the slit of the slot machine of fame and fortune that gives up reputation and dough i offer sure of your acquiescence that we now forswear hypocritical philosophy and bigoted comment permitting the story to finish itself in the dress of material allegations a medium more worthy when held to the line than the most laborious creations of the word milliners page of o henry s manuscript missing here easily among the wings with his patron the great del delano for whatever footlights shone in the city that would be amused the freedom of their unshaded side was del s and if he should take up an amateur see and bring him around see and winking one of his cold blue eyes say to the manager take it from me he s got the goods see you wouldn t expect that amateur to sit on an unpainted bench sudorifically awaiting his turn would you so mac strolled around largely with the nonpareil and the seven waited clammily on the bench a giant in shirt sleeves with a grim kind face in which many stitches had been taken by surgeons from time to time i e with a long stick looped at the end he was the man with the hook the manager with his close smoothed blond hair his one sided smile and his abnormally easy manner pored with patient condescension over the difficult program of the amateurs the last of the professional turns the grand march of the happy huzzard had been completed the last wrinkle and darn of their blue silkolene cotton tights had vanished from the stage the man in the orchestra who played the kettle drum cymbals triangle sandpaper whang doodle hoof beats and catcalls and fired the pistol shots had wiped his brow the illegal holiday of the romans had arrived while the orchestra plays the famous waltz from the dismal wife let us bestow two hundred words upon the psychology of the audience the orchestra floor was filled by people the boxes contained persons in the galleries was the foreordained verdict the claque was there as it had originated in the stone age and was afterward adapted by the french every micky and maggie who sat upon creary s amateur bench wise beyond their talents knew that their success or doom lay already meted out to them by that crowded whistling roaring mass of romans in the three galleries they knew that the winning or the losing of the game for each one lay in the strength of the gang aloft that could turn the applause to its favorite on a broadway first night a wooer of fame may win it from the ticket buyers over the heads of the cognoscenti but not so at creary s the amateur s fate is arithmetical the number of his supporting admirers present at his try out decides it in advance but how these outlying friday nights put to a certain shame the mondays tuesdays wednesdays thursdays saturdays and matinees of the broadway stage you should know here the manuscript ends aristocracy versus hash from the rolling stone the snake reporter of the rolling stone was wandering up the avenue last night on his way home from the y m c a rooms when he was approached by a gaunt hungry looking man with wild eyes and dishevelled hair he accosted the reporter in a hollow weak voice can you tell me sir where i can find in this town a family of scrubs i don t understand exactly let me tell you how it is said the stranger inserting his forefinger in the reporter s buttonhole and badly damaging his chrysanthemum i am a representative from soapstone county and i and my family are houseless homeless and shelterless we have not tasted food for over a week i brought my family with me as i have indigestion and could not get around much with the boys some days ago i started out to find a boarding house as i cannot afford to put up at a hotel i found a nice aristocratic looking place that suited me and went in and asked for the proprietress a very stately lady with a roman nose came in the room she had one hand laid across her stom across her waist and the other held a lace handkerchief i told her i wanted board for myself and family and she condescended to take us i asked for her terms and she said per week i had two dollars in my pocket and i gave her that for a fine teapot that i broke when i fell over the table when she spoke you appear surprised says she you will please remembah that i am the widow of governor riddle of georgiah my family is very highly connected i give you board as a favah i nevah considah money any equivalent for the advantage of my society i well i got out of there and i went to some other places the next lady was a cousin of general mahone of virginia and wanted four dollars an hour for a back room with a pink motto and a burnet granite bed in it the next one was an aunt of davy crockett and asked eight dollars a day for a room furnished in imitation of the alamo with prunes for breakfast and one hour s conversation with her for dinner another one said she was a descendant of benedict arnold on her father s side and captain kidd on the other she took more after captain kidd she only had one meal and prayers a day and counted her society worth a week i found nine widows of supreme judges twelve relicts of governors and generals and twenty two ruins left by various happy colonels professors and majors who valued their aristocratic worth from to per week with weak kneed hash and dried apples on the side i admire people of fine descent but my stomach yearns for pork and beans instead of culture am i not right your words said the reporter convince me that you have uttered what you have said thanks you see how it is i am not wealthy i have only my per diem and my perquisites and i cannot afford to pay for high lineage and moldy ancestors a little corned beef goes further with me than a coronet and when i am cold a coat of arms does not warm me i greatly fear said the reporter with a playful hiccough that you have run against a high toned town most all the first class boarding houses here are run by ladies of the old southern families the very first in the land i am now desperate said the representative as he chewed a tack awhile thinking it was a clove i want to find a boarding house where the proprietress was an orphan found in a livery stable whose father was a dago from east austin and whose grandfather was never placed on the map i want a scrubby ornery low down snuff dipping back woodsy piebald gang who never heard of finger bowls or ward mcallister but who can get up a mess of hot cornbread and irish stew at regular market quotations is there such a place in austin the snake reporter sadly shook his head i do not know he said but i will shake you for the beer ten minutes later the slate in the blue ruin saloon bore two additional characters the prisoner of zembla from the rolling stone so the king fell into a furious rage so that none durst go near him for fear and he gave out that since the princess ostla had disobeyed him there would be a great tourney and to the knight who should prove himself of the greatest valor he would give the hand of the princess and he sent forth a herald to proclaim that he would do this and the herald went about the country making his desire known blowing a great tin horn and riding a noble steed that pranced and gambolled and the villagers gazed upon him and said lo that is one of them tin horn gamblers concerning which the chroniclers have told us and when the day came the king sat in the grandstand holding the gage of battle in his band and by his side sat the princess ostla looking very pale and beautiful but with mournful eyes from which she scarce could keep the tears and the knights which came to the tourney gazed upon the princess in wonder at her beauty and each swore to win so that he could marry her and board with the king suddenly the heart of the princess gave a great bound for she saw among the knights one of the poor students with whom she had been in love the knights mounted and rode in a line past the grandstand and the king stopped the poor student who had the worst horse and the poorest caparisons of any of the knights and said sir knight prithee tell me of what that marvellous shacky and rusty looking armor of thine is made oh king said the young knight seeing that we are about to engage in a big fight i would call it scrap iron wouldn t you ods bodkins said the king the youth hath a pretty wit about this time the princess ostla who began to feel better at the sight of her lover slipped a piece of gum into her mouth and closed her teeth upon it and even smiled a little and showed the beautiful pearls with which her mouth was set whereupon as soon as the knights perceived this of them went over to the king s treasurer and settled for their horse feed and went home it seems very hard said the princess that i cannot marry when i chews but two of the knights were left one of them being the princess lover here s enough for a fight anyhow said the king come hither o knights will ye joust for the hand of this fair lady we joust will said the knights the two knights fought for two hours and at length the princess lover prevailed and stretched the other upon the ground the victorious knight made his horse caracole before the king and bowed low in his saddle on the princess ostla s cheeks was a rosy flush in her eyes the light of excitement vied with the soft glow of love her lips were parted her lovely hair unbound and she grasped the arms of her chair and leaned forward with heaving bosom and happy smile to hear the words of her lover you have foughten well sir knight said the king and if there is any boon you crave you have but to name it then said the knight i will ask you this i have bought the patent rights in your kingdom for schneider s celebrated monkey wrench and i want a letter from you endorsing it you shall have it said the king but i must tell you that there is not a monkey in my kingdom with a yell of rage the victorious knight threw himself on his horse and rode away at a furious gallop the king was about to speak when a horrible suspicion flashed upon him and he fell dead upon the grandstand my god he cried he has forgotten to take the princess with him a strange story from the rolling stone in the northern part of austin there once dwelt an honest family by the name of smothers the family consisted of john smothers his wife himself their little daughter five years of age and her parents making six people toward the population of the city when counted for a special write up but only three by actual count one night after supper the little girl was seized with a severe colic and john smothers hurried down town to get some medicine he never came back the little girl recovered and in time grew up to womanhood the mother grieved very much over her husband s disappearance and it was nearly three months before she married again and moved to san antonio the little girl also married in time and after a few years had rolled around she also had a little girl five years of age she still lived in the same house where they dwelt when her father had left and never returned one night by a remarkable coincidence her little girl was taken with cramp colic on the anniversary of the disappearance of john smothers who would now have been her grandfather if he had been alive and had a steady job i will go downtown and get some medicine for her said john smith for it was none other than he whom she had married no no dear john cried his wife you too might disappear forever and then forget to come back so john smith did not go and together they sat by the bedside of little pansy for that was pansy s name after a little pansy seemed to grow worse and john smith again attempted to go for medicine but his wife would not let him suddenly the door opened and an old man stooped and bent with long white hair entered the room hello here is grandpa said pansy she had recognized him before any of the others the old man drew a bottle of medicine from his pocket and gave pansy a spoonful she got well immediately i was a little late said john smothers as i waited for a street car fickle fortune or how gladys hustled from the rolling stone press me no more mr snooper said gladys vavasour smith i can never be yours you have led me to believe different gladys said bertram d snooper the setting sun was flooding with golden light the oriel windows of a magnificent mansion situated in one of the most aristocratic streets west of the brick yard bertram d snooper a poor but ambitious and talented young lawyer had just lost his first suit he had dared to aspire to the hand of gladys vavasour smith the beautiful and talented daughter of one of the oldest and proudest families in the county the bluest blood flowed in her veins her grandfather had sawed wood for the hornsbys and an aunt on her mother s side had married a man who had been kicked by general lee s mule the lines about bertram d snooper s hands and mouth were drawn tighter as he paced to and fro waiting for a reply to the question he intended to ask gladys as soon as he thought of one at last an idea occurred to him why will you not marry me he asked in an inaudible tone because said gladys firmly speaking easily with great difficulty the progression and enlightenment that the woman of to day possesses demand that the man shall bring to the marriage altar a heart and body as free from the debasing and hereditary iniquities that now no longer exist except in the chimerical imagination of enslaved custom it is as i expected said bertram wiping his heated brow on the window curtain you have been reading books besides that continued gladys ignoring the deadly charge you have no money the blood of the snoopers rose hastily and mantled the cheek of bertram d he put on his coat and moved proudly to the door stay here till i return he said i will be back in fifteen years when he had finished speaking he ceased and left the room when he had gone gladys felt an uncontrollable yearning take possession of her she said slowly rather to herself than for publication i wonder if there was any of that cold cabbage left from dinner she then left the room when she did so a dark complexioned man with black hair and gloomy desperate looking clothes came out of the fireplace where he had been concealed and stated aha i have you in my power at last bertram d snooper gladys vavasour smith shall be mine i am in the possession of secrets that not a soul in the world suspects i have papers to prove that bertram snooper is the heir to the footnote an estate famous in texas legal history it took many many years for adjustment and a large part of the property was of course consumed as expenses of litigation tom bean estate and i have discovered that gladys grandfather who sawed wood for the hornsby s was also a cook in major rhoads fisher s command during the war therefore the family repudiate her and she will marry me in order to drag their proud name down in the dust ha ha ha as the reader has doubtless long ago discovered this man was no other than henry r grasty mr grasty then proceeded to gloat some more and then with a sardonic laugh left for new york fifteen years have elapsed of course our readers will understand that this is only supposed to the the case it really took less than a minute to make the little stars that represent an interval of time we could not afford to stop a piece in the middle and wait fifteen years before continuing it we hope this explanation will suffice we are careful not to create any wrong impressions gladys vavasour smith and henry r grasty stood at the marriage altar mr grasty had evidently worked his rabbit s foot successfully although he was quite a while in doing so just as the preacher was about to pronounce the fatal words on which he would have realized ten dollars and had the laugh on mr grasty the steeple of the church fell off and bertram d snooper entered the preacher fell to the ground with a dull thud he could ill afford to lose ten dollars he was hastily removed and a cheaper one secured bertram d snooper held a statesman in his hand aha he said i thought i would surprise you i just got in this morning here is a paper noticing my arrival he handed it to henry r grasty mr grasty looked at the paper and turned deadly pale it was dated three weeks after mr snooper s arrival foiled again he hissed speak bertram d snooper said gladys why have you come between me and henry i have just discovered that i am the sole heir to tom bean s estate and am worth two million dollars with a glad cry gladys threw herself in bertram s arms henry r grasty drew from his breast pocket a large tin box and opened it took therefrom pages of closely written foolscap what you say is true mr snooper but i ask you to read that he said handing it to bertram snooper mr snooper had no sooner read the document than he uttered a piercing shriek and bit off a large chew of tobacco all is lost he said what is that document asked gladys governor hogg s message it is not as bad as that said bertram but it deprives me of my entire fortune but i care not for that gladys since i have won you what is it speak i implore you said gladys those papers said henry r grasty are the proofs of my appointment as administrator of the tom bean estate with a loving cry gladys threw herself in henry r grasty s arms twenty minutes later bertram d snooper was seen deliberately to enter a beer saloon on seventeenth street an apology this appeared in the rolling stone shortly before it suspended publication never to resume the person who sweeps the office translates letters from foreign countries deciphers communications from graduates of business colleges and does most of the writing for this paper has been confined for the past two weeks to the under side of a large red quilt with a joint caucus of la grippe and measles

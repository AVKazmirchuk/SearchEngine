in a minstrel troupe by nine o clock the streets were almost deserted not at the consulate was there often a change of bill keogh would come there nightly for coralio s one cool place was the little porch of that official residence the brandy would be kept moving and before midnight sentiment would begin to stir in the heart of the self exiled consul then he would relate to keogh the story of his ended romance each night keogh would listen patiently to the tale and be ready with untiring sympathy but don t you think for a minute thus johnny would always conclude his woeful narrative that i m grieving about that girl billy i ve forgotten her she never enters my mind if she were to enter that door right now my pulse wouldn t gain a beat that s all over long ago don t i know it keogh would answer of course you ve forgotten her proper thing to do wasn t quite k of her to listen to the knocks that er dink pawson kept giving you pink dawson a word of contempt would be in johnny s tones poor white trash that s what he was had five hundred acres of farming land though and that counted maybe i ll have a chance to get back at him some day the dawsons weren t anybody everybody in alabama knows the atwoods say billy did you know my mother was a de graffenreid why no keogh would say is that so he had heard it some three hundred times fact the de graffenreids of hancock county but i never think of that girl any more do i billy not for a minute my boy would be the last sounds heard by the conqueror of cupid at this point johnny would fall into a gentle slumber and keogh would saunter out to his own shack under the calabash tree at the edge of the plaza in a day or two the letter from the dalesburg postmaster and its answer had been forgotten by the coralio exiles but on the th day of july the fruit of the reply appeared upon the tree of events the andador a fruit steamer that visited coralio regularly drew into the offing and anchored the beach was lined with spectators while the quarantine doctor and the custom house crew rowed out to attend to their duties an hour later billy keogh lounged into the consulate clean and cool in his linen clothes and grinning like a pleased shark guess what he said to johnny lounging in his hammock too hot to guess said johnny lazily your shoe store man s come said keogh rolling the sweet morsel on his tongue with a stock of goods big enough to supply the continent as far down as tierra del fuego they re carting his cases over to the custom house now six barges full they brought ashore and have paddled back for the rest oh ye saints in glory won t there be regalements in the air when he gets onto the joke and has an interview with mr consul it ll be worth nine years in the tropics just to witness that one joyful moment keogh loved to take his mirth easily he selected a clean place on the matting and lay upon the floor the walls shook with his enjoyment johnny turned half over and blinked didn t tell me he said that anybody was fool enough to take that letter seriously four thousand dollar stock of goods gasped keogh in ecstasy talk about coals to newcastle why didn t he take a ship load of palm leaf fans to spitzenbergen while he was about it saw the old codger on the beach you ought to have been there when he put on his specs and squinted at the five hundred or so barefooted citizens standing around are you telling the truth billy asked the consul weakly am i you ought to see the buncoed gentleman s daughter he brought along looks she makes the brick dust senoritas here look like tar babies go on said johnny if you can stop that asinine giggling i hate to see a grown man make a laughing hyena of himself name is hemstetter went on keogh he s a hello what s the matter now johnny s moccasined feet struck the floor with a thud as he wriggled out of his hammock get up you idiot he said sternly or i ll brain you with this inkstand that s rosine and her father gad what a drivelling idiot old patterson is get up here billy keogh and help me what the devil are we going to do has all the world gone crazy keogh rose and dusted himself he managed to regain a decorous demeanor situation has got to be met johnny he said with some success at seriousness i didn t think about its being your girl until you spoke first thing to do is to get them comfortable quarters you go down and face the music and i ll trot out to goodwin s and see if mrs goodwin won t take them in they ve got the decentest house in town bless you billy said the consul i knew you wouldn t desert me the world s bound to come to an end but maybe we can stave it off for a day or two keogh hoisted his umbrella and set out for goodwin s house johnny put on his coat and hat he picked up the brandy bottle but set it down again without drinking and marched bravely down to the beach in the shade of the custom house walls he found mr hemstetter and rosine surrounded by a mass of gaping citizens the

you caballeros i have related the history of that session when we issued that so ridiculous commission of a truth our jest has been turned against us behold the frankenstein s monster we have created don sabas glanced toward the shore the lights of coralio were drawing near he could see the beach the warehouse of the bodega nacional the long low cuartel occupied by the soldiers and behind that gleaming in the moonlight a stretch of high adobe wall he had seen men stood with their faces to that wall and shot dead again he addressed the extravagant figure at the helm it is true he said that i am fleeing the country but receive the assurance that i care very little for that courts and camps everywhere are open to sabas placido vaya what is this molehill of a republic this pig s head of a country to a man like me i am a paisano of everywhere in rome in london in paris in vienna you will hear them say welcome back don sabas come tonto baboon of a boy admiral whatever you call yourself turn your boat put us on board the salvador and here is your pay five hundred pesos in money of the estados unidos more than your lying government will pay you in twenty years don sabas pressed a plump purse against the youth s hand the admiral gave no heed to the words or the movement braced against the helm he was holding the sloop dead on her shoreward course his dull face was lit almost to intelligence by some inward conceit that seemed to afford him joy and found utterance in another parrot like cackle that is why they do it he said so that you will not see the guns they fire boom and you fall dead with your face to the wall yes the admiral called a sudden order to his crew the lithe silent caribs made fast the sheets they held and slipped down the hatchway into the hold of the sloop when the last one had disappeared don sabas like a big brown leopard leaped forward closed and fastened the hatch and stood smiling no rifles if you please dear admiral he said it was a whimsey of mine once to compile a dictionary of the carib lengua so i understood your order perhaps now you will he cut short his words for he heard the dull swish of iron scraping along tin the admiral had drawn the cutlass of pedro lafitte and was darting upon him the blade descended and it was only by a display of surprising agility that the large man escaped with only a bruised shoulder the glancing weapon he was drawing his pistol as he sprang and the next instant he shot the admiral down don sabas stooped over him and rose again in the heart he said briefly senores the navy is abolished colonel rafael sprang to the helm and the other officer hastened to loose the mainsail sheets the boom swung round el nacional veered and began to tack industriously for the salvador strike that flag senor called colonel rafael our friends on the steamer will wonder why we are sailing under it well said cried don sabas advancing to the mast he lowered the flag to the deck where lay its too loyal supporter thus ended the minister of war s little piece of after dinner drollery and by the same hand that began it suddenly don sabas gave a great cry of joy and ran down the slanting deck to the side of colonel rafael across his arm he carried the flag of the extinguished navy mire mire senor ah dios already can i hear that great bear of an oestreicher shout du hast mein herz gebrochen mire of my friend herr grunitz of vienna you have heard me relate that man has travelled to ceylon for an orchid to patagonia for a headdress to benares for a slipper to mozambique for a spearhead to add to his famous collections thou knowest also amigo rafael that i have been a gatherer of curios my collection of battle flags of the world s navies was the most complete in existence until last year then herr grunitz secured two such rare specimens one of a barberry state and one of the makarooroos a tribe on the west coast of africa i have not those but they can be procured but this flag senor do you know what it is name of god do you know see that red cross upon the blue and white ground you never saw it before seguramente no it is the naval flag of your country mire this rotten tub we stand upon is its navy that dead cockatoo lying there was its commander that stroke of cutlass and single pistol shot a sea battle all a piece of absurd foolery i grant you but authentic there has never been another flag like this and there never will be another no it is unique in the whole world yes think of what that means to a collector of flags do you know coronel mio how many golden crowns herr grunitz would give for this flag ten thousand likely well a hundred thousand would not buy it beautiful flag only flag little devil of a most heaven born flag o he old grumbler beyond the ocean wait till don sabas comes again to the konigin strasse he will let you kneel and touch the folds of it with one finger o he old spectacled ransacker of the world forgotten was the impotent revolution the danger the loss the gall of defeat possessed solely by the inordinate and unparalleled passion of the collector he strode up and down the little deck clasping to his breast with one hand the paragon of a flag he snapped his fingers triumphantly toward the east he shouted the paean to his prize

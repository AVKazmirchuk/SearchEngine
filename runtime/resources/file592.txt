hundred and thirty seven or one hundred and sixty five or some such number now said he you see what alcohol does to the blood pressure it s marvellous said i but do you think it a sufficient test have one on me and let s try the other arm but no then he grasped my hand i thought i was doomed and he was saying good bye but all he wanted to do was to jab a needle into the end of a finger and compare the red drop with a lot of fifty cent poker chips that he had fastened to a card it s the haemoglobin test he explained the colour of your blood is wrong well said i i know it should be blue but this is a country of mix ups some of my ancestors were cavaliers but they got thick with some people on nantucket island so i mean said the doctor that the shade of red is too light oh said i it s a case of matching instead of matches the doctor then pounded me severely in the region of the chest when he did that i don t know whether he reminded me most of napoleon or battling or lord nelson then he looked grave and mentioned a string of grievances that the flesh is heir to mostly ending in itis i immediately paid him fifteen dollars on account is or are it or some or any of them necessarily fatal i asked i thought my connection with the matter justified my manifesting a certain amount of interest all of them he answered cheerfully but their progress may be arrested with care and proper continuous treatment you may live to be eighty five or ninety i began to think of the doctor s bill eighty five would be sufficient i am sure was my comment i paid him ten dollars more on account the first thing to do he said with renewed animation is to find a sanitarium where you will get a complete rest for a while and allow your nerves to get into a better condition i myself will go with you and select a suitable one so he took me to a mad house in the catskills it was on a bare mountain frequented only by infrequent frequenters you could see nothing but stones and boulders some patches of snow and scattered pine trees the young physician in charge was most agreeable he gave me a stimulant without applying a compress to the arm it was luncheon time and we were invited to partake there were about twenty inmates at little tables in the dining room the young physician in charge came to our table and said it is a custom with our guests not to regard themselves as patients hut merely as tired ladies and gentlemen taking a rest whatever slight maladies they may have are never alluded to in conversation my doctor called loudly to a waitress to bring some phosphoglycerate of lime hash dog bread bromo seltzer pancakes and nux vomica tea for my repast then a sound arose like a sudden wind storm among pine trees it was produced by every guest in the room whispering loudly neurasthenia except one man with a nose whom i distinctly heard say chronic alcoholism i hope to meet him again the physician in charge turned and walked away an hour or so after luncheon he conducted us to the workshop say fifty yards from the house thither the guests had been conducted by the physician in charge s understudy and sponge holder a man with feet and a blue sweater he was so tall that i was not sure he had a face hut the armour packing company would have been delighted with his hands here said the physician in charge our guests find relaxation from past mental worries by devoting themselves to physical labour recreation in reality there were turning lathes carpenters outfits clay modelling tools spinning wheels weaving frames treadmills bass drums enlarged crayon portrait apparatuses blacksmith forges and everything seemingly that could interest the paying lunatic guests of a first rate sanitarium the lady making mud pies in the corner whispered the physician in charge is no other than lula lulington the authoress of the novel entitled why love loves what she is doing now is simply to rest her mind after performing that piece of work i had seen the book why doesn t she do it by writing another one instead i asked as you see i wasn t as far gone as they thought i was the gentleman pouring water through the funnel continued the physician in charge is a wall street broker broken down from overwork i buttoned my coat others he pointed out were architects playing with noah s arks ministers reading darwin s theory of evolution lawyers sawing wood tired out society ladies talking ibsen to the blue sweatered sponge holder a neurotic millionaire lying asleep on the floor and a prominent artist drawing a little red wagon around the room you look pretty strong said the physician in charge to me i think the best mental relaxation for you would be throwing small boulders over the mountainside and then bringing them up again i was a hundred yards away before my doctor overtook me what s the matter he asked the matter is said i that there are no aeroplanes handy so i am going to merrily and hastily jog the foot pathway to yon station and catch the first unlimited soft coal express back to town well said the doctor perhaps you are right this seems hardly the suitable place for you but what you need is rest absolute rest and exercise that night i went to a hotel in the city and said to the clerk what i need is absolute rest and exercise can you give me a room with one of those tall

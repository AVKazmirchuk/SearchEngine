able to make good biscuits once before when nick was cooking at the willow ranch sam had been forced to fly from his cuisine after only a six weeks sojourn on sam s face was an expression of sorrow deepened with regret and slightly tempered by the patient forgiveness of a connoisseur who cannot be understood but very firmly and inexorably he buckled his saddle cinches looped his stake rope and hung it to his saddle horn tied his slicker and coat on the cantle and looped his quirt on his right wrist the merrydews householders of the rancho altito men women children and servants vassals visitors employes dogs and casual callers were grouped in the gallery of the ranch house all with faces set to the tune of melancholy and grief for as the coming of sam galloway to any ranch camp or cabin between the rivers frio or bravo del norte aroused joy so his departure caused mourning and distress and then during absolute silence except for the bumping of a hind elbow of a hound dog as he pursued a wicked flea sam tenderly and carefully tied his guitar across his saddle on top of his slicker and coat the guitar was in a green duck bag and if you catch the significance of it it explains sam sam galloway was the last of the troubadours of course you know about the troubadours the encyclopaedia says they flourished between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries what they flourished doesn t seem clear you may be pretty sure it wasn t a sword maybe it was a fiddlebow or a forkful of spaghetti or a lady s scarf anyhow sam galloway was one of em sam put on a martyred expression as he mounted his pony but the expression on his face was hilarious compared with the one on his pony s you see a pony gets to know his rider mighty well and it is not unlikely that cow ponies in pastures and at hitching racks had often guyed sam s pony for being ridden by a guitar player instead of by a rollicking cussing all wool cowboy no man is a hero to his saddle horse and even an escalator in a department store might be excused for tripping up a troubadour oh i know i m one and so are you you remember the stories you memorize and the card tricks you study and that little piece on the piano how does it go ti tum te tum ti tum those little arabian ten minute entertainments that you furnish when you go up to call on your rich aunt jane you should know that omnae personae in tres partes divisae sunt namely brons troubadours and workers barons have no inclination to read such folderol as this and workers have no time so i know you must be a troubadour and that you will understand sam galloway whether we sing act dance write lecture or paint we are only troubadours so let us make the worst of it the pony with the dante alighieri face guided by the pressure of sam s knees bore that wandering minstrel sixteen miles southeastward nature was in her most benignant mood league after league of delicate sweet flowerets made fragrant the gently undulating prairie the east wind tempered the spring warmth wool white clouds flying in from the mexican gull hindered the direct rays of the april sun sam sang songs as he rode under his pony s bridle he had tucked some sprigs of chaparral to keep away the deer flies thus crowned the long faced quadruped looked more dantesque than before and judging by his countenance seemed to think of beatrice straight as topography permitted sam rode to the sheep ranch of old man ellison a visit to a sheep ranch seemed to him desirable just then there had been too many people too much noise argument competition confusion at rancho altito he had never conferred upon old man ellison the favour of sojourning at his ranch but he knew he would be welcome the troubadour is his own passport everywhere the workers in the castle let down the drawbridge to him and the baron sets him at his left hand at table in the banquet hall there ladies smile upon him and applaud his songs and stories while the workers bring boars heads and flagons if the baron nods once or twice in his carved oaken chair he does not do it maliciously old man ellison welcomed the troubadour flatteringly he had often heard praises of sam galloway from other ranchmen who had been complimented by his visits but had never aspired to such an honour for his own humble barony i say barony because old man ellison was the last of the barons of course mr bulwer lytton lived too early to know him or he wouldn t have conferred that sobriquet upon warwick in life it is the duty and the function of the baron to provide work for the workers and lodging and shelter for the troubadours old man ellison was a shrunken old man with a short yellow white beard and a face lined and seamed by past and gone smiles his ranch was a little two room box house in a grove of hackberry trees in the lonesomest part of the sheep country his household consisted of a kiowa indian man cook four hounds a pet sheep and a half tamed coyote chained to a fence post he owned sheep which he ran on two sections of leased land and many thousands of acres neither leased nor owned three or four times a year some one who spoke his language would ride up to his gate and exchange a few bald ideas with him those were red letter days to old man ellison then in what illuminated embossed and gorgeously decorated capitals must have been written the day on which a troubadour

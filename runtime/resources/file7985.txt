smoke and brag and unshorn hair jess learned to drink a cocktail in order to get the cherry at home she smoked a cigarette after dinner she learned to pronounce chianti and leave her olive stones for the waiter to pick up once she essayed to say la la la in a crowd but got only as far as the second one they met one or two couples while dining out and became friendly with them the sideboard was stocked with scotch and rye and a liqueur they had their new friends in to dinner and all were laughing at nothing by a m some plastering fell in the room below them for which bob had to pay thus they footed it merrily on the ragged frontiers of the country that has no boundary lines or government and soon bob fell in with his cronies and learned to keep his foot on the little rail six inches above the floor for an hour or so every afternoon before he went home drink always rubbed him the right way and he would reach his rooms as jolly as a sandboy jessie would meet him at the door and generally they would dance some insane kind of a rigadoon about the floor by way of greeting once when bob s feet became confused and he tumbled headlong over a foot stool jessie laughed so heartily and long that he had to throw all the couch pillows at her to make her hush in such wise life was speeding for them on the day when bob babbitt first felt the power that the giftie gi ed him but let us get back to our lamb and mint sauce when bob got home that evening he found jessie in a long apron cutting up a lobster for the newburg usually when bob came in mellow from his hour at the bar his welcome was hilarious though somewhat tinctured with scotch smoke by screams and snatches of song and certain audible testimonials of domestic felicity was his advent proclaimed when she heard his foot on the stairs the old maid in the hall room always stuffed cotton into her ears at first jessie had shrunk from the rudeness and favor of these spiritual greetings but as the fog of the false bohemia gradually encompassed her she came to accept them as love s true and proper greeting bob came in without a word smiled kissed her neatly but noiselessly took up a paper and sat down in the hall room the old maid held her two plugs of cotton poised filled with anxiety jessie dropped lobster and knife and ran to him with frightened eyes what s the matter bob are you ill not at all dear then what s the matter with you nothing hearken brethren when she who has a right to ask interrogates you concerning a change she finds in your mood answer her thus tell her that you in a sudden rage have murdered your grandmother tell her that you have robbed orphans and that remorse has stricken you tell her your fortune is swept away that you are beset by enemies by bunions by any kind of malevolent fate but do not if peace and happiness are worth as much as a grain of mustard seed to you do not answer her nothing jessie went back to the lobster in silence she cast looks of darkest suspicion at bob he had never acted that way before when dinner was on the table she set out the bottle of scotch and the glasses bob declined tell you the truth jess he said i ve cut out the drink help yourself of course if you don t mind i ll try some of the seltzer straight you ve stopped drinking she said looking at him steadily and unsmilingly what for it wasn t doing me any good said bob don t you approve of the idea jessie raised her eyebrows and one shoulder slightly entirely she said with a sculptured smile i could not conscientiously advise any one to drink or smoke or whistle on sunday the meal was finished almost in silence bob tried to make talk but his efforts lacked the stimulus of previous evenings he felt miserable and once or twice his eye wandered toward the bottle but each time the scathing words of his bibulous friend sounded in his ear and his mouth set with determination jessie felt the change deeply the essence of their lives seemed to have departed suddenly the restless fever the false gayety the unnatural excitement of the shoddy bohemia in which they had lived had dropped away in the space of the popping of a cork she stole curious and forlorn glances at the dejected bob who bore the guilty look of at least a wife beater or a family tyrant after dinner the colored maid who came in daily to perform such chores cleared away the things jessie with an unreadable countenance brought back the bottle of scotch and the glasses and a bowl of cracked ice and set them on the table may i ask she said with some of the ice in her tones whether i am to be included in your sudden spasm of goodness if not i ll make one for myself it s rather chilly this evening for some reason oh come now jess said bob good naturedly don t be too rough on me help yourself by all means there s no danger of your overdoing it but i thought there was with me and that s why i quit have yours and then let s get out the banjo and try over that new quickstep i ve heard said jessie in the tones of the oracle that drinking alone is a pernicious habit no i don t think i feel like playing this evening if we are going to reform we may as well abandon the evil habit of banjo playing too she took up a book and sat in her little willow rocker on the other side of the table neither of them spoke for half an hour and then bob laid down his paper and got up with a strange absent look on his face and went behind her chair and reached over her shoulders taking her hands in his and laid his face close to hers in a moment to jessie the walls of the seine hung room vanished and she saw the sullivan county hills and rills bob felt her hands quiver in his as he began the verse from old omar come fill the cup and in the fire of spring the winter garment of repentance fling the bird of time has but a little way to fly and lo the bird is on the wing and then he walked to the table and poured a stiff drink of scotch into a glass but in that moment a mountain breeze had somehow found its way in and blown away the mist of the false bohemia jessie leaped and with one fierce sweep of her hand sent the bottle and glasses crashing to the floor the same motion of her arm carried it around bob s neck where it met its mate and fastened tight oh my god bobbie not that verse i see now i wasn t always such a fool was i the other one boy the one that says remould it to the heart s desire say that one to the heart s desire i know that one said bob it goes ah love could you and i with him conspire to grasp this sorry scheme of things entire would not we let me finish it said jessie would not we shatter it to bits and then remould it nearer to the heart s desire it s shattered all right said bob crunching some glass under his heel in some dungeon below the accurate ear of mrs pickens the landlady located the smash it s that wild mr babbitt coming home soused again she said and he s got such a nice little wife too the pendulum eighty first street let em out please yelled the shepherd in blue a flock of citizen sheep scrambled out and another flock scrambled aboard ding ding the cattle cars of the manhattan elevated rattled away and john perkins drifted down the stairway of the station with the released flock john walked slowly toward his flat slowly because in the lexicon of his daily life there was no such word as perhaps there are no surprises awaiting a man who has been married two years and lives in a flat as he walked john perkins prophesied to himself with gloomy and downtrodden cynicism the foregone conclusions of the monotonous day katy would meet him at the door with a kiss flavored with cold cream and butter scotch he would remove his coat sit upon a macadamized lounge and read in the evening paper of russians and japs slaughtered by the deadly linotype for dinner there would be pot roast a salad flavored with a dressing warranted not to crack or injure the leather stewed rhubarb and the bottle of strawberry marmalade blushing at the certificate of chemical purity on its label after dinner katy would show him the new patch in her crazy quilt that the iceman had cut for her off the end of his four in hand at half past seven they would spread newspapers over the furniture to catch the pieces of plastering that fell when the fat man in the flat overhead began to take his physical culture exercises exactly at eight hickey mooney of the vaudeville team unbooked in the flat across the hall would yield to the gentle influence of delirium tremens and begin to overturn chairs under the delusion that hammerstein was pursuing them with a five hundred dollar a week contract then the gent at the window across the air shaft would get out his flute the nightly gas leak would steal forth to frolic in the highways the dumbwaiter would slip off its trolley the janitor would drive mrs zanowitski s five children once more across the yalu the lady with the champagne shoes and the skye terrier would trip downstairs and paste her thursday name over her bell and letter box and the evening routine of the frogmore flats would be under way john perkins knew these things would happen and he knew that at a quarter past eight he would summon his nerve and reach for his hat and that his wife would deliver this speech in a querulous tone now where are you going i d like to know john perkins thought i d drop up to mccloskey s he would answer and play a game or two of pool with the fellows of late such had been john perkins s habit at ten or eleven he would return sometimes katy would be asleep sometimes waiting up ready to melt in the crucible of her ire a little more gold plating from the wrought steel chains of matrimony for these things cupid will have to answer when he stands at the bar of justice with his victims from the frogmore flats to night john perkins encountered a tremendous upheaval of the commonplace when he reached his door no katy was there with her affectionate confectionate kiss the three rooms seemed in portentous disorder all about lay her things in confusion shoes in the middle of the floor curling tongs hair bows kimonos powder box jumbled together on dresser and chairs this was not katy s way with a sinking heart john saw the comb with a curling cloud of her brown hair among its teeth some unusual hurry and perturbation must have possessed her for she always carefully placed these combings in the little blue vase on the mantel to be some day formed into the coveted feminine rat hanging conspicuously to the gas jet by a string was a folded paper john seized it it was a note from his wife running thus dear john i just had a telegram saying mother is very sick i am going to take the train brother sam is going to meet me at the depot there there is cold mutton in the ice box i hope it isn t her quinzy again pay the milkman cents she had it bad last spring don t forget to write to the company about the gas meter and your good socks are in the top drawer i will write to morrow hastily katy never during their two years of matrimony had he and katy been separated for a night john read the note over and over in a dumbfounded way here was a break in a routine that had never varied and it left him dazed there on the back of a chair hung pathetically empty and formless the red wrapper with black dots that she always wore while getting the meals her week day clothes had been tossed here and there in her haste a little paper bag of her favorite butterscotch lay with its string yet unwound a daily paper sprawled on the floor gaping rectangularly where a railroad time table had been clipped from it everything in the room spoke of a loss of an essence gone of its soul and life departed john perkins stood among the dead remains with a queer feeling of desolation in his heart he began to set the rooms tidy as well as he could when he touched her clothes a thrill of something like terror went through him he had never thought what existence would be without katy she had become so thoroughly annealed into his life that she was like the air he breathed necessary but scarcely noticed now without warning she was gone vanished as completely absent as if she had never existed of course it would be only for a few days or at most a week or two but it seemed to him as if the very hand of death had pointed a finger at his secure and uneventful home john dragged the cold mutton from the ice box made coffee and sat down to a lonely meal face to face with the strawberry marmalade s shameless certificate of purity bright among withdrawn blessings now appeared to him the ghosts of pot roasts and the salad with tan polish dressing his home was dismantled a quinzied mother in law had knocked his lares and penates sky high after his solitary meal john sat at a front window he did not care to smoke outside the city roared to him to come join in its dance of folly and pleasure the night was his he might go forth unquestioned and thrum the strings of jollity as free as any gay bachelor there he might carouse and wander and have his fling until dawn if he liked and there would be no wrathful katy waiting for him bearing the chalice that held the dregs of his joy he might play pool at mccloskey s with his roistering friends until aurora dimmed the electric bulbs if he chose the hymeneal strings that had curbed him always when the frogmore flats had palled upon him were loosened katy was gone john perkins was not accustomed to analyzing his emotions but as he sat in his katy bereft x parlor he hit unerringly upon the keynote of his discomfort he knew now that katy was necessary to his happiness his feeling for her lulled into unconsciousness by the dull round of domesticity had been sharply stirred by the loss of her presence has it not been dinned into us by proverb and sermon and fable that we never prize the music till the sweet voiced bird has flown or in other no less florid and true utterances i m a double dyed dub mused john perkins the way i ve been treating katy off every night playing pool and bumming with the boys instead of staying home with her the poor girl here all alone with nothing to amuse her and me acting that way john perkins you re the worst kind of a shine i m going to make it up for the little girl i ll take her out and let her see some amusement and i ll cut out the mccloskey gang right from this minute yes there was the city roaring outside for john perkins to come dance in the train of momus and at mccloskey s the boys were knocking the balls idly into the pockets against the hour for the nightly game but no primrose way nor clicking cue could woo the remorseful soul of perkins the bereft the thing that was his lightly held and half scorned had been taken away from him and he wanted it backward to a certain man named adam whom the cherubim bounced from the orchard could perkins the remorseful trace his descent near the right hand of john perkins stood a chair on the back of it stood katy s blue shirtwaist it still retained something of her contour midway of the sleeves were fine individual wrinkles made by the movements of her arms in working for his comfort and pleasure a delicate but impelling odor of bluebells came from it john took it and looked long and soberly at the unresponsive grenadine katy had never been unresponsive tears yes tears came into john perkins s eyes when she came back things would be different he would make up for all his neglect what was life without her the door opened katy walked in carrying a little hand satchel john stared at her stupidly my i m glad to get back said katy ma wasn t sick to amount to anything sam was at the depot and said she just had a little spell and got all right soon after they telegraphed so i took the next train back i m just dying for a cup of coffee nobody heard the click and rattle of the cog wheels as the third floor front of the frogmore flats buzzed its machinery back into the order of things a band slipped a spring was touched the gear was adjusted and the wheels revolve in their old orbit john perkins looked at the clock it was he reached for his hat and walked to the door now where are you going i d like to know john perkins asked katy in a querulous tone thought i d drop up to mccloskey s said john and play a game or two of pool with the fellows two thanksgiving day gentlemen there is one day that is ours there is one day when all we americans who are not self made go back to the old home to eat saleratus biscuits and marvel how much nearer to the porch the old pump looks than it used to bless the day president roosevelt gives it to us we hear some talk of the puritans but don t just remember who they were bet we can lick em anyhow if they try to land again plymouth rocks well that sounds more familiar lots of us have had to come down to hens since the turkey trust got its work in but somebody in washington is leaking out advance information to em about these thanksgiving proclamations the big city east of the cranberry bogs has made thanksgiving day an institution the last thursday in november is the only day in the year on which it recognizes the part of america lying across the ferries it is the one day that is purely american yes a day of celebration exclusively american and now for the story which is to prove to you that we have traditions on this side of the ocean that are becoming older at a much rapider rate than those of england are thanks to our git up and enterprise stuffy pete took his seat on the third bench to the right as you enter union square from the east at the walk opposite the fountain every thanksgiving day for nine years he had taken his seat there promptly at o clock for every time he had done so things had happened to him charles dickensy things that swelled his waistcoat above his heart and equally on the other side but to day stuffy pete s appearance at the annual trysting place seemed to have been rather the result of habit than of the yearly hunger which as the philanthropists seem to think afflicts the poor at such extended intervals certainly pete was not hungry he had just come from a feast that had left him of his powers barely those of respiration and locomotion his eyes were like two pale gooseberries firmly imbedded in a swollen and gravy smeared mask of putty his breath came in short wheezes a senatorial roll of adipose tissue denied a fashionable set to his upturned coat collar buttons that had been sewed upon his clothes by kind salvation fingers a week before flew like popcorn strewing the earth around him ragged he was with a split shirt front open to the wishbone but the november breeze carrying fine snowflakes brought him only a grateful coolness for stuffy pete was overcharged with the caloric produced by a superbountiful dinner beginning with oysters and ending with plum pudding and including it seemed to him all the roast turkey and baked potatoes and chicken salad and squash pie and ice cream in the world wherefore he sat gorged and gazed upon the world with after dinner contempt the meal had been an unexpected one he was passing a red brick mansion near the beginning of fifth avenue in which lived two old ladies of ancient family and a reverence for traditions they even denied the existence of new york and believed that thanksgiving day was declared solely for washington square one of their traditional habits was to station a servant at the postern gate with orders to admit the first hungry wayfarer that came along after the hour of noon had struck and banquet him to a finish stuffy pete happened to pass by on his way to the park and the seneschals gathered him in and upheld the custom of the castle after stuffy pete had gazed straight before him for ten minutes he was conscious of a desire for a more varied field of vision with a tremendous effort he moved his head slowly to the left and then his eyes bulged out fearfully and his breath ceased and the rough shod ends of his short legs wriggled and rustled on the gravel for the old gentleman was coming across fourth avenue toward his bench every thanksgiving day for nine years the old gentleman had come there and found stuffy pete on his bench that was a thing that the old gentleman was trying to make a tradition of every thanksgiving day for nine years he had found stuffy there and had led him to a restaurant and watched him eat a big dinner they do those things in england unconsciously but this is a young country and nine years is not so bad the old gentleman was a staunch american patriot and considered himself a pioneer in american tradition in order to become picturesque we must keep on doing one thing for a long time without ever letting it get away from us something like collecting the weekly dimes in industrial insurance or cleaning the streets the old gentleman moved straight and stately toward the institution that he was rearing truly the annual feeling of stuffy pete was nothing national in its character such as the magna charta or jam for breakfast was in england but it was a step it was almost feudal it showed at least that a custom was not impossible to new y ahem america the old gentleman was thin and tall and sixty he was dressed all in black and wore the old fashioned kind of glasses that won t stay on your nose his hair was whiter and thinner than it had been last year and he seemed to make more use of his big knobby cane with the crooked handle as his established benefactor came up stuffy wheezed and shuddered like some woman s over fat pug when a street dog bristles up at him he would have flown but all the skill of santos dumont could not have separated him from his bench well had the myrmidons of the two old ladies done their work good morning said the old gentleman i am glad to perceive that the vicissitudes of another year have spared you to move in health about the beautiful world for that blessing alone this day of thanksgiving is well proclaimed to each of us if you will come with me my man i will provide you with a dinner that should make your physical being accord with the mental that is what the old gentleman said every time every thanksgiving day for nine years the words themselves almost formed an institution nothing could be compared with them except the declaration of independence always before they had been music in stuffy s ears but now he looked up at the old gentleman s face with tearful agony in his own the fine snow almost sizzled when it fell upon his perspiring brow but the old gentleman shivered a little and turned his back to the wind stuffy had always wondered why the old gentleman spoke his speech rather sadly he did not know that it was because he was wishing every time that he had a son to succeed him a son who would come there after he was gone a son who would stand proud and strong before some subsequent stuffy and say in memory of my father then it would be an institution but the old gentleman had no relatives he lived in rented rooms in one of the decayed old family brownstone mansions in one of the quiet streets east of the park in the winter he raised fuchsias in a little conservatory the size of a steamer trunk in the spring he walked in the easter parade in the summer he lived at a farmhouse in the new jersey hills and sat in a wicker armchair speaking of a butterfly the ornithoptera amphrisius that he hoped to find some day in the autumn he fed stuffy a dinner these were the old gentleman s occupations stuffy pete looked up at him for a half minute stewing and helpless in his own self pity the old gentleman s eyes were bright with the giving pleasure his face was getting more lined each year but his little black necktie was in as jaunty a bow as ever and the linen was beautiful and white and his gray mustache was curled carefully at the ends and then stuffy made a noise that sounded like peas bubbling in a pot speech was intended and as the old gentleman had heard the sounds nine times before he rightly construed them into stuffy s old formula of acceptance thankee sir i ll go with ye and much obliged i m very hungry sir the coma of repletion had not prevented from entering stuffy s mind the conviction that he was the basis of an institution his thanksgiving appetite was not his own it belonged by all the sacred rights of established custom if not by the actual statute of limitations to this kind old gentleman who bad preempted it true america is free but in order to establish tradition some one must be a repetend a repeating decimal the heroes are not all heroes of steel and gold see one here that wielded only weapons of iron badly silvered and tin the old gentleman led his annual protege southward to the restaurant and to the table where the feast had always occurred they were recognized here comes de old guy said a waiter dat blows dat same bum to a meal every thanksgiving the old gentleman sat across the table glowing like a smoked pearl at his corner stone of future ancient tradition the waiters heaped the table with holiday food and stuffy with a sigh that was mistaken for hunger s expression raised knife and fork and carved for himself a crown of imperishable bay no more valiant hero ever fought his way through the ranks of an enemy turkey chops soups vegetables pies disappeared before him as fast as they could be served gorged nearly to the uttermost when he entered the restaurant the smell of food had almost caused him to lose his honor as a gentleman but he rallied like a true knight he saw the look of beneficent happiness on the old gentleman s face a happier look than even the fuchsias and the ornithoptera aniphrisins had ever brought to it and he had not the heart to see it wane in an hour stuffy leaned back with a battle won thankee kindly sir he puffed like a leaky steam pipe thankee kindly for a hearty meal then he arose heavily with glazed eyes and started toward the kitchen a waiter turned him about like a top and pointed him toward the door the old gentleman carefully counted out in silver change leaving three nickels for the waiter they parted as they did each year at the door the old gentleman going south stuffy north around the first corner stuffy turned and stood for one minute then he seemed to puff out his rags as an owl puffs out his feathers and fell to the sidewalk like a sunstricken horse when the ambulance came the young surgeon and the driver cursed softly at his weight there was no smell of whiskey to justify a transfer to the patrol wagon so stuffy and his two dinners went to the hospital there they stretched him on a bed and began to test him for strange diseases with the hope of getting a chance at some problem with the bare steel and lo an hour later another ambulance brought the old gentleman and they laid him on another bed and spoke of appendicitis for he looked good for the bill but pretty soon one of the young doctors met one of the young nurses whose eyes he liked and stopped to chat with her about the cases that nice old gentleman over there now he said you wouldn t think that was a case of almost starvation proud old family i guess he told me he hadn t eaten a thing for three days the assessor of success hastings beauchamp morley sauntered across union square with a pitying look at the hundreds that lolled upon the park benches they were a motley lot he thought the men with stolid animal unshaven faces the women wriggling and self conscious twining and untwining their feet that hung four inches above the gravelled walks were i mr carnegie or mr rockefeller i would put a few millions in my inside pocket and make an appointment with all the park commissioners around the corner if necessary and arrange for benches in all the parks of the world low enough for women to sit upon and rest their feet upon the ground after that i might furnish libraries to towns that would pay for em or build sanitariums for crank professors and call em colleges if i wanted to women s rights societies have been laboring for many years after equality with man with what result when they sit on a bench they must twist their ankles together and uncomfortably swing their highest french heels clear of earthly support begin at the bottom ladies get your feet on the ground and then rise to theories of mental equality hastings beauchamp morley was carefully and neatly dressed that was the result of an instinct due to his birth and breeding it is denied us to look further into a man s bosom than the starch on his shirt front so it is left to us only to recount his walks and conversation morley had not a cent in his pockets but he smiled pityingly at a hundred grimy unfortunate ones who had no more and who would have no more when the sun s first rays yellowed the tall paper cutter building on the west side of the square but morley would have enough by then sundown had seen his pockets empty before but sunrise had always seen them lined first he went to the house of a clergyman off madison avenue and presented a forged letter of introduction that holily purported to issue from a pastorate in indiana this netted him when backed up by a realistic romance of a delayed remittance on the sidewalk twenty steps from the clergyman s door a pale faced fat man huskily enveloped him with a raised red fist and the voice of a bell buoy demanding payment of an old score why bergman man sang morley dulcetly is this you i was just on my way up to your place to settle up that remittance from my aunt arrived only this morning wrong address was the trouble come up to the corner and i ll square up glad to see you saves me a walk four drinks placated the emotional bergman there was an air about morley when he was backed by money in hand that would have stayed off a call loan at rothschilds when he was penniless his bluff was pitched half a tone lower but few are competent to detect the difference in the notes you gum to mine blace and bay me to morrow mr morley said bergman oxcuse me dat i dun you on der street but i haf not seen you in dree mont pros t morley walked away with a crooked smile on his pale smooth face the credulous drink softened german amused him he would have to avoid twenty ninth street in the future he had not been aware that bergman ever went home by that route at the door of a darkened house two squares to the north morley knocked with a peculiar sequence of raps the door opened to the length of a six inch chain and the pompous important black face of an african guardian imposed itself in the opening morley was admitted in a third story room in an atmosphere opaque with smoke he hung for ten minutes above a roulette wheel then downstairs he crept and was out sped by the important negro jingling in his pocket the cents in silver that remained to him of his five dollar capital at the corner lie lingered undecided across the street was a drug store well lighted sending forth gleams from the german silver and crystal of its soda fountain and glasses along came a youngster of five headed for the dispensary stepping high with the consequence of a big errand possibly one to which his advancing age had earned him promotion in his hand he clutched something tightly publicly proudly conspicuously morley stopped him with his winning smile and soft speech me said the youngster i m doin to the drug tore for mamma she dave me a dollar to buy a bottle of med cin now now now said morley such a big man you are to be doing errands for mamma i must go along with my little man to see that the cars don t run over him and on the way we ll have some chocolates or would he rather have lemon drops morley entered the drug store leading the child by the hand he presented the prescription that had been wrapped around the money on his face was a smile predatory parental politic profound aqua pura one pint said he to the druggist sodium chloride ten grains fiat solution and don t try to skin me because i know all about the number of gallons of h o in the croton reservoir and i always use the other ingredient on my potatoes fifteen cents said the druggist with a wink after he had compounded the order i see you understand pharmacy a dollar is the regular price to gulls said morley smilingly he settled the wrapped bottle carefully in the child s arms and escorted him to the corner in his own pocket he dropped the cents accruing to him by virtue of his chemical knowledge look out for the cars sonny he said cheerfully to his small victim two street cars suddenly swooped in opposite directions upon the youngster morley dashed between them and pinned the infantile messenger by the neck holding him in safety then from the corner of his street he sent him on his way swindled happy and sticky with vile cheap candy from the italian s fruit stand morley went to a restaurant and ordered a sirloin and a pint of inexpensive chateau breuille he laughed noiselessly but so genuinely that the waiter ventured to premise that good news had come his way why no said morley who seldom held conversation with any one it is not that it is something else that amuses me do you know what three divisions of people are easiest to over reach in transactions of all kinds sure said the waiter calculating the size of the tip promised by the careful knot of morley s tie there s the buyers from the dry goods stores in the south during august and honeymooners from staten island and wrong said morley chuckling happily the answer is just men women and children the world well say new york and as far as summer boarders can swim out from long island is full of greenhorns two minutes longer on the broiler would have made this steak fit to be eaten by a gentleman francois if yez t inks it s on de bum said the waiter oi ll morley lifted his hand in protest slightly martyred protest it will do he said magnanimously and now green chartreuse frappe and a demi tasse morley went out leisurely and stood on a corner where two tradeful arteries of the city cross with a solitary dime in his pocket he stood on the curb watching with confident cynical smiling eyes the tides of people that flowed past him into that stream he must cast his net and draw fish for his further sustenance and need good izaak walton had not the half of his self reliance and bait lore a joyful party of four two women and two men fell upon him with cries of delight there was a dinner party on where had he been for a fortnight past what luck to thus run upon him they surrounded and engulfed him he must join them tra la la and the rest one with a white hat plume curving to the shoulder touched his sleeve and cast at the others a triumphant look that said see what i can do with him and added her queen s command to the invitations i leave you to imagine said morley pathetically how it desolates me to forego the pleasure but my friend carruthers of the new york yacht club is to pick me up here in his motor car at the white plume tossed and the quartet danced like midges around an arc light down the frolicsome way morley stood turning over and over the dime in his pocket and laughing gleefully to himself front he chanted under his breath front does it it is trumps in the game how they take it in men women and children forgeries water and salt lies how they all take it in an old man with an ill fitting suit a straggling gray beard and a corpulent umbrella hopped from the conglomeration of cabs and street cars to the sidewalk at morley s side stranger said he excuse me for troubling you but do you know anybody in this here town named solomon smothers he s my son and i ve come down from ellenville to visit him be darned if i know what i done with his street and number i do not sir said morley half closing his eyes to veil the joy in them you had better apply to the police the police said the old man i ain t done nothin to call in the police about i just come down to see ben he lives in a five story house he writes me if you know anybody by that name and could i told you i did not said morley coldly i know no one by the name of smithers and i advise you to smothers not smithers interrupted the old man hopefully a heavy sot man sandy complected about twenty nine two front teeth out about five foot oh smothers exclaimed morley sol smothers why he lives in the next house to me i thought you said smithers morley looked at his watch you must have a watch you can do it for a dollar better go hungry than forego a gunmetal or the ninety eight cent one that the railroads according to these watchmakers are run by the bishop of long island said morley was to meet me here at to dine with me at the kingfishers club but i can t leave the father of my friend sol smothers alone on the street by st swithin mr smothers we wall street men have to work tired is no name for it i was about to step across to the other corner and have a glass of ginger ale with a dash of sherry when you approached me you must let me take you to sol s house mr smothers but before we take the car i hope you will join me in an hour later morley seated himself on the end of a quiet bench in madison square with a twenty five cent cigar between his lips and in deeply creased bills in his inside pocket content light hearted ironical keenly philosophic he watched the moon drifting in and out amidst a maze of flying clouds an old ragged man with a low bowed head sat at the other end of the bench presently the old man stirred and looked at his bench companion in morley s appearance he seemed to recognize something superior to the usual nightly occupants of the benches kind sir he whined if you could spare a dime or even a few pennies to one who morley cut short his stereotyped appeal by throwing him a dollar god bless you said the old man i ve been trying to find work for work echoed morley with his ringing laugh you are a fool my friend the world is a rock to you no doubt but you must be an aaron and smite it with your rod then things better than water will gush out of it for you that is what the world is for it gives to me whatever i want from it god has blessed you said the old man it is only work that i have known and now i can get no more i must go home said morley rising and buttoning his coat i stopped here only for a smoke i hope you may find work may your kindness be rewarded this night said the old man oh said morley you have your wish already i am satisfied i think good luck follows me like a dog i am for yonder bright hotel across the square for the night and what a moon that is lighting up the city to night i think no one enjoys the moonlight and such little things as i do well a goodnight to you morley walked to the corner where he would cross to his hotel he blew slow streams of smoke from his cigar heavenward a policeman passing saluted to his benign nod what a fine moon it was the clock struck nine as a girl just entering womanhood stopped on the corner waiting for the approaching car she was hurrying as if homeward from employment or delay her eyes were clear and pure she was dressed in simple white she looked eagerly for the car and neither to the right nor the left morley knew her eight years before he had sat on the same bench with her at school there had been no sentiment between them nothing but the friendship of innocent days but he turned down the side street to a quiet spot and laid his suddenly burning face against the cool iron of a lamp post and said dully god i wish i could die the buyer from cactus city it is well that hay fever and colds do not obtain in the healthful vicinity of cactus city texas for the dry goods emporium of navarro platt situated there is not to be sneezed at twenty thousand people in cactus city scatter their silver coin with liberal hands for the things that their hearts desire the bulk of this semiprecious metal goes to navarro platt their huge brick building covers enough ground to graze a dozen head of sheep you can buy of them a rattlesnake skin necktie an automobile or an eighty five dollar latest style ladies tan coat in twenty different shades navarro platt first introduced pennies west of the colorado river they had been ranchmen with business heads who saw that the world did not necessarily have to cease its revolutions after free grass went out every spring navarro senior partner fifty five half spanish cosmopolitan able polished had gone on to new york to buy goods this year he shied at taking up the long trail he was undoubtedly growing older and he looked at his watch several times a day before the hour came for his siesta john he said to his junior partner you shall go on this year to buy the goods platt looked tired i m told said he that new york is a plumb dead town but i ll go i can take a whirl in san antone for a few days on my way and have some fun two weeks later a man in a texas full dress suit black frock coat broad brimmed soft white hat and lay down collar inch high with black wrought iron necktie entered tile wholesale cloak and suit establishment of zizzbaum son on lower broadway old zizzbaum had the eye of an osprey the memory of an elephant and a mind that unfolded from him in three movements like the puzzle of the carpenter s rule he rolled to the front like a brunette polar bear and shook platt s hand and how is the good mr navarro in texas he said the trip was too long for him this year so we welcome mr platt instead a bull s eye said platt and i d give forty acres of unirrigated pecos county land to know how you did it i knew grinned zizzbaum just as i know that the rainfall in el paso for the year was inches or an increase of inches and that therefore navarro platt will buy a stock of suits this spring instead of as in a dry year but that will be tomorrow there is first a cigar in my private office that will remove from your mouth the taste of the ones you smuggle across the rio grande and like because they are smuggled it was late in the afternoon and business for the day had ended zizzbaum left platt with a half smoked cigar and came out of the private office to son who was arranging his diamond scarfpin before a mirror ready to leave abey lie said you will have to take mr platt around to night and show him things they are customers for ten years mr navarro and i we played chess every moment of spare time when he came that is good but mr platt is a young man and this is his first visit to new york he should amuse easily all right said abey screwing the guard tightly on his pin i ll take him on after he s seen the flatiron

at but he ll be all to the mrs winslow before then the next morning at platt walked into the store ready to do business he had a bunch of hyacinths pinned on his lapel zizzbaum himself waited on him navarro platt were good customers and never failed to take their discount for cash and what did you think of our little town asked zizzbaum with the fatuous smile of the manhattanite i shouldn t care to live in it said the texan your son and i knocked around quite a little last night you ve got good water but cactus city is better lit up we ve got a few lights on broadway don t you think mr platt and a good many shadows said platt i think i like your horses best i haven t seen a crowbait since i ve been in town zizzbaum led him up stairs to show the samples of suits ask miss asher to come he said to a clerk miss asher came and platt of navarro platt felt for the first time the wonderful bright light of romance and glory descend upon him he stood still as a granite cliff above the canon of the colorado with his wide open eyes fixed upon her she noticed his look and flushed a little which was contrary to her custom miss asher was the crack model of zizzbaum son she was of the blond type known as medium and her measurements even went the required standard a little better she had been at zizzbaum s two years and knew her business her eye was bright but cool and had she chosen to match her gaze against the optic of the famed basilisk that fabulous monster s gaze would have wavered and softened first incidentally she knew buyers now mr platt said zizzbaum i want you to see these princess gowns in the light shades they will be the thing in your climate this first if you please miss asher swiftly in and out of the dressing room the prize model flew each time wearing a new costume and looking more stunning with every change she posed with absolute self possession before the stricken buyer who stood tongue tied and motionless while zizzbaum orated oilily of the styles on the model s face was her faint impersonal professional smile that seemed to cover something like weariness or contempt when the display was over platt seemed to hesitate zizzbaum was a little anxious thinking that his customer might be inclined to try elsewhere but platt was only looking over in his mind the best building sites in cactus city trying to select one on which to build a house for his wife to be who was just then in the dressing room taking off an evening gown of lavender and tulle take your time mr platt said zizzbaum think it over to night you won t find anybody else meet our prices on goods like these i m afraid you re having a dull time in new york mr platt a young man like you of course you miss the society of the ladies wouldn t you like a nice young lady to take out to dinner this evening miss asher now is a very nice young lady she will make it agreeable for you why she doesn t know me said platt wonderingly she doesn t know anything about me would she go i m not acquainted with her would she go repeated zizzbaum with uplifted eyebrows sure she would go i will introduce you sure she would go he called miss asher loudly she came calm and slightly contemptuous in her white shirt waist and plain black skirt mr platt would like the pleasure of your company to dinner this evening said zizzbaum walking away sure said miss asher looking at the ceiling i d be much pleased nine eleven west twentieth street what time say seven o clock all right but please don t come ahead of time i room with a school teacher and she doesn t allow any gentlemen to call in the room there isn t any parlor so you ll have to wait in the hall i ll be ready at half past seven platt and miss asher sat at a table in a broadway restaurant she was dressed in a plain filmy black platt didn t know that it was all a part of her day s work with the unobtrusive aid of a good waiter he managed to order a respectable dinner minus the usual broadway preliminaries miss asher flashed upon him a dazzling smile mayn t i have something to drink she asked why certainly said platt anything you want a dry martini she said to the waiter when it was brought and set before her platt reached over and took it away what is this he asked a cocktail of course i thought it was some kind of tea you ordered this is liquor you can t drink this what is your first name to my intimate friends said miss asher freezingly it is helen listen helen said platt leaning over the table for many years every time the spring flowers blossomed out on the prairies i got to thinking of somebody that i d never seen or heard of i knew it was you the minute i saw you yesterday i m going back home to morrow and you re going with me i know it for i saw it in your eyes when you first looked at me you needn t kick for you ve got to fall into line here s a little trick i picked out for you on my way over he flicked a two carat diamond solitaire ring across the table miss asher flipped it back to him with her fork don t get fresh she said severely i m worth a hundred thousand dollars said platt i ll build you the finest house in west texas you can t buy me mr buyer said miss asher if you had a hundred million i didn t think i d have to call you down you didn t look like the others to me at first but i see you re all alike all who asked platt all you buyers you think because we girls have to go out to dinner with you or lose our jobs that you re privileged to say what you please well forget it i thought you were different from the others but i see i was mistaken platt struck his fingers on the table with a gesture of sudden illuminating satisfaction i ve got it he exclaimed almost hilariously the nicholson place over on the north side there s a big grove of live oaks and a natural lake the old house can be pulled down and the new one set further back put out your pipe said miss asher i m sorry to wake you up but you fellows might as well get wise once for all to where you stand i m supposed to go to dinner with you and help jolly you along so you ll trade with old zizzy but don t expect to find me in any of the suits you buy do you mean to tell me

generally talk diamonds while you ve actually dug one up how long have you been working helen got my name pat haven t you i ve been supporting myself for eight years i was a cash girl and a wrapper and then a shop girl until i was grown and then i got to be a suit model mr texas man don t you think a little wine would make this dinner a little less dry you re not going to drink wine any more

of hearing such talk after the dinner they walked down broadway and came upon diana s little wooded park the trees caught platt s eye at once and he must turn along under the winding walk beneath them the lights shone upon two bright tears in the model s eyes i don t like that said platt what s the matter don t you mind said miss asher well it s because well i didn t think you were that kind when i first saw you but you are all like and now will you take me home or will i have to call a cop platt took her to the door of her boarding house they stood for a minute in the vestibule she looked at him with such scorn in her eyes that even his heart of oak began to waver his arm was half way around her waist when she struck him a stinging blow on the face with her open hand as he stepped back a ring fell from somewhere and bounded on the tiled floor platt groped for it and found it now take your useless diamond and go mr buyer she said this was the other one the wedding ring said the texan holding the smooth gold band on the palm of his hand miss asher s eyes blazed upon him in the half darkness was that what you meant did you somebody opened the door from inside the house good night said platt i ll see you at the store to morrow miss asher ran up to her room and shook the school teacher until she sat up in bed ready to scream fire where is it she cried that s what i want to know

caracas is in venezuela of course what s it like why it s principally earthquakes and negroes and monkeys and malarial fever and volcanoes i don t care said miss asher blithely i m going there to

sweetness the wonder the thrill of it attained once more the maximum of his incessant dreams the next instant an icy blade was driven deep between his shoulders he felt his blood slowly congeal heard the senile cackle of the perennial spaniard saw the plaza rise and reel till the zenith crashed into the horizon and knew no more when tansey opened his eyes again he was sitting upon those self same steps gazing upon the dark bulk of the sleeping convent in the middle of his back was still the acute chilling pain how had he been conveyed back there again he got stiffly to his feet and stretched his cramped limbs supporting himself against the stonework he revolved in his mind the extravagant adventures that had befallen him each time he had strayed from the steps that night in reviewing them certain features strained his credulity had he really met captain peek or katie or the unparalleled mexican in his wanders had he really encountered them under commonplace conditions and his over stimulated brain had supplied the incongruities however that might be a sudden elating thought caused him an intense joy nearly all of us have at some point in our lives either to excuse our own stupidity or to placate our consciences promulgated some theory of fatalism we have set up an intelligent fate that works by codes and signals tansey had done likewise and now he read through the night s incidents the finger prints of destiny each excursion that he had made had led to the one paramount finale to katie and that kiss which survived and grew strong and intoxicating in his memory clearly fate was holding up to him the mirror that night calling him to observe what awaited him at the end of whichever road he might take he immediately turned and hurried homeward clothed in an elaborate pale blue wrapper cut to fit miss katie peek reclined in an armchair before a waning fire in her room her little bare feet were thrust into house shoes rimmed with swan s down by the light of a small lamp she was attacking the society news of the latest sunday paper some happy substance seemingly indestructible was being rhythmically crushed between her small white teeth miss katie read of functions and furbelows but she kept a vigilant ear for outside sounds and a frequent eye upon the clock over the mantel at every footstep upon the asphalt sidewalk her smooth round chin would cease for a moment its regular rise and fall and a frown of listening would pucker her pretty brows at last she heard the latch of the iron gate click she sprang up tripped softly to the mirror where she made a few of those feminine flickering passes at her front hair and throat which are warranted to hypnotize the approaching guest the door bell rang miss katie in her haste turned the blaze of the lamp lower instead of higher and hastened noiselessly down stairs into the hall she turned the key the door opened and mr tansey side stepped in why the i de a exclaimed miss katie is this you mr tansey it s after midnight aren t you ashamed to wake me up at such an hour to let you in you re just awful i was late said tansey brilliantly i should think you were ma was awfully worried about you when you weren t in by ten that hateful tom mcgill said you were out calling on another said you were out calling on some young lady i just despise mr mcgill well i m not going to scold you any more mr tansey if it is a little late oh i turned it the wrong way miss katie gave a little scream absent mindedly she had turned the blaze of the lamp entirely out instead of higher it was very dark tansey heard a musical soft giggle and breathed an entrancing odour of heliotrope a groping light hand touched his arm how awkward i was can you find your way sam i i think i have a match miss k katie a scratching sound a flame a glow of light held at arm s length by the recreant follower of destiny illuminating a tableau which shall end the ignominious chronicle a maid with unkissed curling contemptuous lips slowly lifting the lamp chimney and allowing the wick to ignite then waving a scornful and abjuring hand toward the staircase the unhappy tansey erstwhile champion in the prophetic lists of fortune ingloriously ascending to his just and certain doom while let us imagine half within the wings stands the imminent figure of fate jerking wildly at the wrong strings and mixing things up in her usual able manner a departmental case in texas you may travel a thousand miles in a straight line if your course is a crooked one it is likely that both the distance and your rate of speed may be vastly increased clouds there sail serenely against the wind the whip poor will delivers its disconsolate cry with the notes exactly reversed from those of his northern brother given a drought and a subsequently lively rain and lo from a glazed and stony soil will spring in a single night blossomed lilies miraculously fair tom green county was once the standard of measurement i have

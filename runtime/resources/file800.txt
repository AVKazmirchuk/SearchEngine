blowing of the captain s whistle the uniformed plain clothes men rushed up the stairs into the pool room when they saw the betting paraphernalia distrib uted around they halted surprised and puzzled to know why they had been summoned but the captain pointed to the lock ed door and bade them break it down in a few moments they demolished it with the axes they carried into the other room sprang

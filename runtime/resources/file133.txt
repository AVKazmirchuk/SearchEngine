of the question george washington was all right you know and nobody could say a word against the angel i don t think so bad of that group if you was to give jupiter a pair of epaulets and a sword and kind of work the clouds around to look like a blackberry patch it wouldn t make such a bad battle scene why if we hadn t already settled on the price he ought to pay an extra thousand for washington and the angel ought to raise it five hundred you don t understand billy said white with an uneasy laugh some of us fellows who try to paint have big notions about art i wanted to paint a picture some day that people would stand before and forget that it was made of paint i wanted it to creep into them like a bar of music and mushroom there like a soft bullet and i wanted em to go away and ask what else has he done and i didn t want em to find a thing not a portrait nor a magazine cover nor an illustration nor a drawing of a girl nothing but the picture that s why i ve lived on fried sausages and tried to keep true to myself i persuaded myself to do this portrait for the chance it might give me to study abroad but this howling screaming caricature good lord can t you see how it is sure said keogh as tenderly as he would have spoken to a child and he laid a long forefinger on white s knee i see it s bad to have your art all slugged up like that i know you wanted to paint a big thing like the panorama of the battle of gettysburg but let me kalsomine you a little mental sketch to consider up to date we re out on this scheme our capital took every cent both of us could raise we ve got about enough left to get back to new york on i need my share of that ten thousand i want to work a copper deal in idaho and make a hundred thousand that s the business end of the thing come down off your art perch carry and let s land that hatful of dollars billy said white with an effort i ll try i won t say i ll do it but i ll try i ll go at it and put it through if i can that s business said keogh heartily good boy now here s another thing rush that picture crowd it through as quick as you can get a couple of boys to help you mix the paint if necessary i ve picked up some pointers around town the people here are beginning to get sick of mr president they say he s been too free with concessions and they accuse him of trying to make a dicker with england to sell out the country we want that picture done and paid for before there s any row in the great patio of casa morena the president caused to be stretched a huge canvas under this white set up his temporary studio for two hours each day the great man sat to him white worked faithfully but as the work progressed he had seasons of bitter scorn of infinite self contempt of sullen gloom and sardonic gaiety keogh with the patience of a great general soothed coaxed argued kept him at the picture at the end of a month white announced that the picture was completed jupiter washington angels clouds cannon and all his face was pale and his mouth drawn straight when he told keogh he said the president was much pleased with it it was to be hung in the national gallery of statesmen and heroes the artist had been requested to return to casa morena on the following day to receive payment at the appointed time he left the hotel silent under his friend s joyful talk of their success an hour later he walked into the room where keogh was waiting threw his hat on the floor and sat upon the table billy he said in strained and laboring tones i ve a little money out west in a small business that my brother is running it s what i ve been living on while i ve been studying art i ll draw out my share and pay you back what you ve lost on this scheme lost exclaimed keogh jumping up didn t you get paid for the picture yes i got paid said white but just now there isn t any picture and there isn t any pay if you care to hear about it here are the edifying details the president and i were looking at the painting his secretary brought a bank draft on new york for ten thousand dollars and handed it to me the moment i touched it i went wild i tore it into little pieces and threw them on the floor a workman was repainting the pillars inside the patio a bucket of his paint happened to be convenient i picked up his brush and slapped a quart of blue paint all over that ten thousand dollar nightmare i bowed and walked out the president didn t move or speak that was one time he was taken by surprise it s tough on you billy but i couldn t help it there seemed to be excitement in coralio outside there was a confused rising murmur pierced by high pitched cries bajo el traidor muerte el traidor were the words they seemed to form listen to that exclaimed white bitterly i know that much spanish they re shouting down with the traitor i heard them before i felt that they meant me i was a traitor to art the picture had to go down with the blank fool would have suited

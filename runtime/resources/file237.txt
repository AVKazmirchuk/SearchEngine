st lucifer house i d show you some breakfast grub antelope steaks and fried liver to begin on and venison cutlets with chili con carne and pineapple fritters and then some sardines and mixed pickles and top it off with a can of yellow clings and a bottle of beer you won t find a layout like that on the bill of affairs of any of your eastern restauraws too lavish says i i ve traveled and i m unprejudiced there ll never be a perfect breakfast eaten until some man grows arms long enough to stretch down to new orleans for his coffee and over to norfolk for his rolls and reaches up to vermont and digs a slice of butter out of a spring house and then turns over a beehive close to a white clover patch out in indiana for the rest then he d come pretty close to making a meal on the amber that the gods eat on mount olympia too ephemeral says caligula i d want ham and eggs or rabbit stew anyhow for a chaser what do you consider the most edifying and casual in the way of a dinner i ve been infatuated from time to time i answers with fancy ramifications of grub such as terrapins lobsters reed birds jambolaya and canvas covered ducks but after all there s nothing less displeasing to me than a beefsteak smothered in mushrooms on a balcony in sound of the broadway streetcars with a hand organ playing down below and the boys hollering extras about the latest suicide for the wine give me a reasonable ponty cany and that s all except a demi tasse well says caligula i reckon in new york you get to be a conniseer and when you go around with the demi tasse you are naturally bound to buy em stylish grub it s a great town for epicures says i you d soon fall into their ways if you was there i ve heard it was says caligula but i reckon i wouldn t i can polish my fingernails all they need myself ii after breakfast we went out on the front porch lighted up two of the landlord s flor de upas perfectos and took a look at georgia the installment of scenery visible to the eye looked mighty poor as far as we could see was red hills all washed down with gullies and scattered over with patches of piny woods blackberry bushes was all that kept the rail fences from falling down about fifteen miles over to the north was a little range of well timbered mountains that town of mountain valley wasn t going about a dozen people permeated along the sidewalks but what you saw mostly was rain barrels and roosters and boys poking around with sticks in piles of ashes made by burning the scenery of uncle tom shows and just then there passes down on the other side of the street a high man in a long black coat and a beaver hat all the people in sight bowed and some crossed the street to shake hands with him folks came out of stores and houses to holler at him women leaned out of windows and smiled and all the kids stopped playing to look at him our landlord stepped out on the porch and bent himself double like a carpenter s rule and sung out good morning colonel when he was a dozen yards gone by and is that alexander pa says caligula to the landlord and why is he called great that gentlemen says the landlord is no less than colonel jackson t rockingham the president of the sunrise edenville tap railroad mayor of mountain valley and chairman of the perry county board of immigration and public improvements been away a good many years hasn t he i asked no sir colonel rockingham is going down to the post office for his mail his fellow citizens take pleasure in greeting him thus every morning the colonel is our most prominent citizen besides the height of the stock of the sunrise edenville tap railroad he owns a thousand acres of that land across the creek mountain valley delights sir to honor a citizen of such worth and public spirit for an hour that afternoon caligula sat on the back of his neck on the porch and studied a newspaper which was unusual in a man who despised print when he was through he took me to the end of the porch among the sunlight and drying dish towels i knew that caligula had invented a new graft for he chewed the ends of his mustache and ran the left catch of his suspenders up and down which was his way what is it now i asks just so it ain t floating mining stocks or raising pennsylvania pinks we ll talk it over pennsylvania pinks oh that refers to a coin raising scheme of the keystoners they burn the soles of old women s feet to make them tell where their money s hid caligula s words in business was always few and bitter you see them mountains said he pointing and you seen that colonel man that owns railroads and cuts more ice when he goes to the post office than roosevelt does when he cleans em out what we re going to do is to kidnap the latter into the former and inflict a ransom of ten thousand dollars illegality says i shaking my head i knew you d say that says caligula at first sight it does seem to jar peace and dignity but it don t i got the idea out of that newspaper would you commit aspersions on a equitable graft that the united states itself has condoned and indorsed and ratified kidnapping says i is an immoral function in the derogatory list of the statutes if the united states upholds it it must be

but i never heard from him any more and i i liked him another flow of tears seemed imminent but tripp hurled himself into the crevasse and dammed it confound him i could see his game he was trying to make a story of it for his sordid ends and profit go on mr chalmers said he and tell the lady what s the proper caper that s what i told her you d hand it to her straight spiel up i coughed and tried to feel less wrathful toward tripp i saw my duty cunningly i had been inveigled but i was securely trapped tripp s first dictum to me had been just and correct the young lady must be sent back to greenburg that day she must be argued with convinced assured instructed ticketed and returned without delay i hated hiram and despised george but duty must be done noblesse oblige and only five silver dollars are not strictly romantic compatibles but sometimes they can be made to jibe it was mine to be sir oracle and then pay the freight so i assumed an air that mingled solomon s with that of the general passenger agent of the long island railroad miss lowery said i as impressively as i could life is rather a queer proposition after all there was a familiar sound to these words after i had spoken them and i hoped miss lowery had never heard mr cohan s song those whom we first love we seldom wed our earlier romances tinged with the magic radiance of youth often fail to materialize the last three words sounded somewhat trite when they struck the air but those fondly cherished dreams i went on may cast a pleasant afterglow on our future lives however impracticable and vague they may have been but life is full of realities as well as visions and dreams one cannot live on memories may i ask miss lowery if you think you could pass a happy that is a contented and harmonious life with mr er dodd if in other ways than romantic recollections he seems to er fill the bill as i might say oh hi s all right answered miss lowery yes i could get along with him fine he s promised me an automobile and a motor boat but somehow when it got so close to the time i was to marry him i couldn t help wishing well just thinking about george something must have happened to him or he d have written on the day he left he and me got a hammer and a chisel and cut a dime into two pieces i took one piece and he took the other and we promised to be true to each other and always keep the pieces till we saw each other again i ve got mine at home now in a ring box in the top drawer of my dresser i guess i was silly to come up here looking for him i never realized what a big place it is and then tripp joined in with a little grating laugh that he had still trying to drag in a little story or drama to earn the miserable dollar that he craved oh the boys from the country forget a lot when they come to the city and learn something i guess george maybe is on the bum or got roped in by some other girl or maybe gone to the dogs on account of whiskey or the races you listen to mr chalmers and go back home and you ll be all right but now the time was come for action for the hands of the clock were moving close to noon frowning upon tripp i argued gently and philosophically with miss lowery delicately convincing her of the importance of returning home at once and i impressed upon her the truth that it would not be absolutely necessary to her future happiness that she mention to hi the wonders or the fact of her visit to the city that had swallowed up the unlucky george she said she had left her horse unfortunate rosinante tied to a tree near the railroad station tripp and i gave her instructions to mount the patient steed as soon as she arrived and ride home as fast as possible there she was to recount the exciting adventure of a day spent with susie adams she could fix susie i was sure of that and all would be well and then being susceptible to the barbed arrows of beauty i warmed to the adventure the three of us hurried to the ferry and there i found the price of a ticket to greenburg to be but a dollar and eighty cents i bought one and a red red rose with the twenty cents for miss lowery we saw her aboard her ferryboat and stood watching her wave her handkerchief at us until it was the tiniest white patch imaginable and then tripp and i faced each other brought back to earth left dry and desolate in the shade of the sombre verities of life the spell wrought by beauty and romance was dwindling i looked at tripp and almost sneered he looked more careworn contemptible and disreputable than ever i fingered the two silver dollars remaining in my pocket and looked at him with the half closed eyelids of contempt he mustered up an imitation of resistance can t you get a story out of it he asked huskily some sort of a story even if you have to fake part of it not a line said i i can fancy the look on grimes face if i should try to put over any slush like this but we ve helped the little lady out and that ll have to be our only reward i m sorry said tripp almost inaudibly i m sorry you re out your money now

very fast to night in this kind of weather said the young man charity avails itself of the proverb and both begins and ends at home and the preacher and his vehement lieutenant struck up a last hymn of petition to providence and man those of the bed liners whose windpipes still registered above degrees hopelessly and tunelessly joined in in the middle of the second verse thomas saw a sturdy girl with wind tossed drapery battling against the breeze and coming straight toward him from the opposite sidewalk annie he yelled and ran toward her you fool you fool she cried weeping and laughing and hanging upon his neck why did you do it the stuff explained thomas briefly you know but subsequently nit not a drop he led her to the curb how did you happen to see me i came to find you said annie holding tight to his sleeve oh you big fool professor cherubusco told us that we might find you here professor ch dont know the guy what saloon does he work in he s a clairvoyant thomas the greatest in the world he found you with the chaldean telescope he said he s a liar said thomas i never had it he never saw me have anybody s telescope and he said you came in a chariot with five wheels or something annie said thoms solicitously you re giving me the wheels now if i had a chariot i d have gone to bed in it long ago and without any singing and preaching for a nightcap either listen you big fool the missis says she ll take you back i begged her to but you must behave and you can go up to the house to night and your old room over the stable is ready great said thomas earnestly you are it annie but when did these stunts happen to night at professor cherubusco s he sent his automobile for the missis and she took me along i ve been there with her before what s the professor s line he s a clairvoyant and a witch the missis consults him he knows everything but he hasn t done the missis any good yet though she s paid him hundreds of dollars but he told us that the stars told him we could find you here what s the old lady want this cherry buster to do that s a family secret said annie and now you ve asked enough questions come on home you big fool they had moved but a little way up the street when thomas stopped got any dough with you annie he asked annie looked at him sharply oh i know what that look means said thomas you re wrong not another drop but there s a guy that was standing next to me in the bed line over there that s in bad shape he s the right kind and he s got wives or kids or something and he s on the sick list no booze if you could dig up half a dollar for him so he could get a decent bed i d like it annie s fingers began to wiggle in her purse sure i ve got money said she lots of it twelve dollars and then she added with woman s ineradicable suspicion of vicarious benevolence bring him here and let me see him first thomas went on his mission the wan bed liner came readily enough as the two drew near annie looked up from her purse and screamed mr walter oh mr walter is that you annie said the young man meekly oh mr walter and the missis hunting high and low for you does mother want to see me he asked with a flush coming out on his pale cheek she s been hunting for you high and low sure she wants to see you she wants you to come home she s tried police and morgues and lawyers and advertising and detectives and rewards and everything and then she took up clearvoyants you ll go right home won t you mr walter gladly if she wants me said the young man three years is a long time i suppose i ll have to walk up though unless the street cars are giving free rides i used to walk and beat that old plug team of bays we used to drive to the carriage have they got them yet they have said thomas feelingly and they ll have em ten years from now the life of the royal elephantibus truckhorseibus is one hundred and forty nine years i m the coachman just got my reappointment five minutes ago let s all ride up in a surface car that is er if annie will pay the fares on the broadway car annie handed each one of the prodigals a nickel to pay the conductor seems to me you are mighty reckless the way you throw large sums of money around said thomas sarcastically in that purse said annie decidedly is exactly i shall take every cent of it to morrow and give it to professor cherubusco the greatest man in the world well said thomas i guess he must be a pretty fly guy to pipe off things the way he does i m glad his spooks told him where you could find me if you ll give me his address some day i ll go up there myself and shake his hand presently thomas moved tentatively in his seat and thoughtfully felt an abrasion or two on his knees and his elbows say annie said he confidentially maybe it s one of the last dreams of booze but i ve a kind of a recollection of riding in authomobile with a swell guy that took me to a house full of eagles and arc lights he fed me on biscuits and hot air and then kicked me down the front steps if it was the d t s why am i so sore shut up you fool said annie if i could find that funny guy s house said thomas in conclusion i d go up there some day and punch his nose for him the poet and the peasant the other day a poet friend of mine who has lived in close communion with nature all his life wrote a poem and took it to an editor it was a living pastoral full of the genuine breath of the fields the song of birds and the pleasant chatter of trickling streams when the poet called again to see about it with hopes of a beefsteak dinner in his heart it was handed back to him with the comment too artificial several of us met over spaghetti and dutchess county chianti and swallowed indignation with slippery forkfuls and there we dug a pit for the editor with us was conant a well arrived writer of fiction a man who had trod on asphalt all his life and who had never looked upon bucolic scenes except with sensations of disgust from the windows of express trains conant wrote a poem and called it the doe and the brook it was a fine specimen of the kind of work you would expect from a poet who had strayed with amaryllis only as far as the florist s windows and whose sole ornithological discussion had been carried on with a waiter conant signed this poem and we sent it to the same editor but this has very little to do with the story just as the editor was reading the first line of the poem on the next morning a being stumbled off the west shore ferryboat and loped slowly up forty second street the invader was a young man with light blue eyes a hanging lip and hair the exact color of the little orphan s afterward discovered to be the earl s daughter in one of mr blaney s plays his trousers were corduroy his coat short sleeved with buttons in the middle of his back one bootleg was outside the corduroys you looked expectantly though in vain at his straw hat for ear holes its shape inaugurating the suspicion that it had been ravaged from a former equine possessor in his hand was a valise description of it is an impossible task a boston man would not have carried his lunch and law books to his office in it and above one ear in his hair was a wisp of hay the rustic s letter of credit his badge of innocence the last clinging touch of the garden of eden lingering to shame the gold brick men knowingly smilingly the city crowds passed him by they saw the raw stranger stand in the gutter and stretch his neck at the tall buildings at this they ceased to smile and even to look at him it had been done so often a few glanced at the antique valise to see what coney attraction or brand of chewing gum he might be thus dinning into his memory but for the most part he was ignored even the newsboys looked bored when he scampered like a circus clown out of the way of cabs and street cars at eighth avenue stood bunco harry with his dyed mustache and shiny good natured eyes harry was too good an artist not to be pained at the sight of an actor overdoing his part he edged up to the countryman who had stopped to open his mouth at a jewelry store window and shook his head too thick pal he said critically too thick by a couple of inches i don t know what your lay is but you ve got the properties too thick that hay now why they don t even allow that on proctor s circuit any more i don t understand you mister said the green one i m not lookin for any circus i ve just run down from ulster county to look at the town bein that the hayin s over with gosh but it s a whopper i thought poughkeepsie was some punkins but this here town is five times as big oh well said bunco harry raising his eyebrows i didn t mean to butt in you don t have to tell i thought you ought to tone down a little so i tried to put you wise wish you success at your graft whatever it is come and have a drink anyhow i wouldn t mind having a glass of lager beer acknowledged the other they went to a caf e frequented by men with smooth faces and shifty eyes and sat at their drinks i m glad i come across you mister said haylocks how d you like to play a game or two of seven up i ve got the keerds he fished them out of noah s valise a rare inimitable deck greasy with bacon suppers and grimy with the soil of cornfields bunco harry laughed loud and briefly not for me sport he said firmly i don t go against that make up of yours for a cent but i still say you ve overdone it the reubs haven t dressed like that since i doubt if you could work brooklyn for a key winding watch with that layout oh you needn t think i ain t got the money boasted haylocks he drew forth a tightly rolled mass of bills as large as a teacup and laid it on the table got that for my share of grandmother s farm he announced there s in that roll thought i d come to the city and look around for a likely business to go into bunco harry took up the roll of money and looked at it with almost respect in his smiling eyes i ve seen worse he said critically but you ll never do it in them clothes you want to get light tan shoes and a black suit and a straw hat with a colored band and talk a good deal about pittsburg and freight differentials and drink sherry for breakfast in order to work off phony stuff like that what s his line asked two or three shifty eyed men of bunco harry after haylocks had gathered up his impugned money and departed the queer i guess said harry or else he s one of jerome s men or some guy with a new graft he s too much hayseed maybe that his i wonder now oh no it couldn t have been real money haylocks wandered on thirst probably assailed him again for he dived into a dark groggery on a side street and bought beer at first sight of him their eyes brightened but when his insistent and exaggerated rusticity became apparent their expressions changed to wary suspicion haylocks swung his valise across the bar keep that a while for me mister he said chewing at the end of a virulent claybank cigar i ll be back after i knock around a spell and keep your eye on it for there s inside of it though maybe you wouldn t think so to look at me somewhere outside a phonograph struck up a band piece and haylocks was off for it his coat tail buttons flopping in the middle of his back divvy mike said the men hanging upon the bar winking openly at one another honest now said the bartender kicking the valise to one side you don t think i d fall to that do you anybody can see he ain t no jay one of mcadoo s come on squad i guess he s a shine if he made himself up there ain t no parts of the country now where they dress like that since they run rural free delivery to providence rhode island if he s got nine fifty in that valise it s a ninety eight cent waterbury that s stopped at ten minutes to ten when haylocks had exhausted the resources of mr edison to amuse he returned for his valise and then down broadway he gallivanted culling the sights with his eager blue eyes but still and evermore broadway rejected him with curt glances and sardonic smiles he was the oldest of the gags that the city must endure he was so flagrantly impossible so ultra rustic so exaggerated beyond the most freakish products of the barnyard the hayfield and the vaudeville stage that he excited only weariness and suspicion and the wisp of hay in his hair was so genuine so fresh and redolent of the meadows so clamorously rural that even a shellgame man would have put up his peas and folded his table at the sight of it haylocks seated himself upon a flight of stone steps and once more exhumed his roll of yellow backs from the valise the outer one a twenty he shucked off and beckoned to a newsboy son said he run somewhere and get this changed for me i m mighty nigh out of chicken feed i guess you ll get a nickel if you ll hurry up a hurt look appeared through the dirt on the newsy s face aw watchert ink g wan and get yer funny bill changed yerself dey ain t no farm clothes yer got on g wan wit yer stage money on a corner lounged a keen eyed steerer for a gambling house he was haylocks and his expression suddenly grew cold and virtuous mister said the rural one i ve heard of places in this here town where a fellow could have a good game of old sledge or peg a card at keno i got in this valise and i come down from old ulster to see the sights know where a fellow could get action on about or i m goin to have some sport and then maybe i ll buy out a business of some kind the steerer looked pained and investigated a white speck on his left forefinger nail cheese it old man he murmured reproachfully the central office must be bughouse to send you out looking like such a gillie you couldn t get within two blocks of a sidewalk crap game in them tony pastor props the recent mr scotty from death valley has got you beat a crosstown block in the way of elizabethan scenery and mechanical accessories let it be skiddoo for yours nay i know of no gilded halls where one may bet a patrol wagon on the ace rebuffed once again by the great city that is so swift to detect artificialities haylocks sat upon the curb and presented his thoughts to hold a conference it s my clothes said he durned if it ain t they think i m a hayseed and won t have nothin to do with me nobody never made fun of this hat in ulster county i guess if you want folks to notice you in new york you must dress up like they do so haylocks went shopping in the bazaars where men spake through their noses and rubbed their hands and ran the tape line ecstatically over the buldge in his inside pocket where reposed a red nubbin of corn with an even number of rows and messengers bearing parcels and boxes streamed to his hotel on broadway within the lights of long acre at o clock in the evening one descended to the sidewalk whom ulster county would have foresworn bright tan were his shoes his hat the latest block his light gray trousers were deeply creased a gay blue silk handkerchief flapped from the breast pocket of his elegant english walking coat his collar might have graced a laundry window his blond hair was trimmed close the wisp of hay was gone for an instant he stood resplendent with the leisurely air of a boulevardier concocting in his mind the route for his evening pleasures and then he turned down the gay bright street with the easy and graceful tread of a millionaire but in the instant that he had paused the wisest and keenest eyes in the city had enveloped him in their field of vision a stout man with gray eyes picked two of his friends with a lift of his eyebrows from the row of loungers in front of the hotel the juiciest jay i ve seen in six months said the man with gray eyes come along it was half past eleven when a man galloped into the west forty seventh street police station with the story of his wrongs nine hundred and fifty dollars he gasped all my share of grandmother s farm the desk seargeant wrung from him the name jabez bulltongue of locust valley farm ulster county and then bagan to take descriptions of the strong arm gentlemen when conant went to see the editor about the fate of his poem he was received over the head of the office boy into the inner office that is decorated with the statuettes by rodin and j g brown when i read the first line of the doe and the brook said the editor i knew it to be the work of one whose life has been heart to heart with nature the finished art of the line did not blind me to that fact to use a somewhat homely comparison it was as if a wild free child of the woods and fields were to don the garb of fashion and walk down broadway beneath the apparel the man would show thanks said conant i suppose the check will be round on thursday as usual the morals of this story have somehow gotten mixed you can take your choice of stay on the farm or don t write poetry the robe of peace mysteries follow one another so closely in a great city that the reading public and the friends of johnny bellchambers have ceased to marvel at his sudden and unexplained disappearance nearly a year ago this particular mystery has now been cleared up but the solution is so strange and incredible to the mind of the average man that only a select few who were in close touch with bellchambers will give it full credence johnny bellchambers as is well known belonged to the intrinsically inner circle of the elite without any of the ostentation of the fashionable ones who endeavor to attract notice by eccentric display of wealth and show he still was au fait in everything that gave deserved lustre to his high position in the ranks of society especially did he shine in the matter of dress in this he was the despair of imitators always correct exquisitely groomed and possessed of an unlimited wardrobe he was conceded to be the best dressed man in new york and therefore in america there was not a tailor in gotham who would not have deemed it a precious boon to have been granted the privilege of making bellchambers clothes without a cent of pay as he wore them they would have been a priceless advertisement trousers were his special passion here nothing but perfection would he notice he would have worn a patch as quickly as he would have overlooked a wrinkle he kept a man in his apartments always busy pressing his ample supply his friends said that three hours was the limit of time that he would wear these garments without exchanging bellchambers disappeared very suddenly for three days his absence brought no alarm to his friends and then they began to operate the usual methods of inquiry all of them failed he had left absolutely no trace behind then the search for a motive was instituted but none was found he had no enemies he had no debts there was no woman there were several thousand dollars in his bank to his credit he had never showed any tendency toward mental eccentricity in fact he was of a particularly calm and well balanced temperament every means of tracing the vanished man was made use of but without avail it was one of those cases more numerous in late years where men seem to have gone out like the flame of a candle leaving not even a trail of smoke as a witness in may tom eyres and lancelot gilliam two of bellchambers old friends went for a little run on the other side while pottering around in italy and switzerland they happened one day to hear of a monastery in the swiss alps that promised something outside of the ordinary tourist beguiling attractions the monastery was almost inaccessible to the average sightseer being on an extremely rugged and precipitous spur of the mountains the attractions it possessed but did not advertise were first an exclusive and divine cordial made by the monks that was said to far surpass benedictine and chartreuse next a huge brass bell so purely and accurately cast that it had not ceased sounding since it was first rung three hundred years ago finally it was asserted that no englishman had ever set foot within its walls eyres and gilliam decided that these three reports called for investigation it took them two days with the aid of two guides to reach the monastery of st gondrau it stood upon a frozen wind swept crag with the snow piled about it in treacherous drifting masses they were hospitably received by the brothers whose duty it was to entertain the infrequent guest they drank of the precious cordial finding it rarely potent and reviving they listened to the great ever echoing bell and learned that they were pioneer travelers in those gray stone walls over the englishman whose restless feet have trodden nearly every corner of the earth at three o clock on the afternoon they arrived the two young gothamites stood with good brother cristofer in the great cold hallway of the monastery to watch the monks march past on their way to the refectory they came slowly pacing by twos with their heads bowed treading noiselessly with sandaled feet upon the rough stone flags as the procession slowly filed past eyres suddenly gripped gilliam by the arm look he whispered eagerly at the one just opposite you now the one on this side with his hand at his waist if that isn t johnny bellchambers then i never saw him gilliam saw and recognized the lost glass of fashion what the deuce said he wonderingly is old bell doing here tommy it surely can t be he never heard of bell having a turn for the religious fact is i ve heard him say things when a four in hand didn t seem to tie up just right that would bring him up for court martial before any church it s bell without a doubt said eyres firmly or i m pretty badly in need of an oculist but think of johnny bellchambers the royal high chancellor of swell togs and the mahatma of pink teas up here in cold storage doing penance in a snuff colored bathrobe i can t get it straight in my mind let s ask the jolly old boy that s doing honors brother cristofer was appealed to for information by that time the monks had passed into the refectory he could not tell to which one they referred bellchambers ah the brothers of st gondrau abandoned their worldly names when they took the vows did the gentlemen wish to speak with one of the brothers if they would come to the refectory and indicate the one they wished to see the reverend abbot in authority would doubtless permit it eyres and gilliam went into the dining hall and pointed out to brother cristofer the man they had seen yes it was johnny bellchambers they saw his face plainly now as he sat among the dingy brothers never looking up eating broth from a coarse brown bowl permission to speak to one of the brothers was granted to the two travelers by the abbot and they waited in a reception room for him to come when he did come treading softly in his sandals both eyres and gilliam looked at him in perplexity and astonishment it was johnny bellchambers but he had a different look upon his smooth shaven face was an expression of ineffable peace of rapturous attainment of perfect and complete happiness his form was proudly erect his eyes shone with a serene and gracious light he was as neat and well groomed as in the old new york days but how differently was he clad now he seemed clothed in but a single garment a long robe of rough brown cloth gathered by a cord at the waist and falling in straight loose folds nearly to his feet he shook hands with his visitors with his old ease and grace of manner if there was any embarrassment in that meeting it was not manifested by johnny bellchambers the room had no seats they stood to converse glad to see you old man said eyres somewhat awkwardly wasn t expecting to find you up here not a bad idea though after all society s an awful sham must be a relief to shake the giddy whirl and retire to er contemplation and er prayer and hymns and those things oh cut that tommy said bellchambers cheerfully don t be afraid that i ll pass around the plate i go through these thing um bobs with the rest of these old boys because they are the rules i m brother ambrose here you know i m given just ten minutes to talk to you fellows that s rather a new design in waistcoats you have on isn t it gilliam are they wearing those things on broadway now it s the same old johnny said gilliam joyfully what the devil i mean why oh confound it what did you do it for old man peel the bathrobe pleaded eyres almost tearfully and go back with us the old crowd ll go wild to see you this isn t in your line bell i know half a dozen girls that wore the willow on the quiet when you shook us in that unaccountable way hand in your resignation or get a dispensation or whatever you have to do to get a release from this ice factory you ll get catarrh here johnny and my god you haven t any socks on bellchambers looked down at his sandaled feet and smiled you fellows don t understand he said soothingly it s nice of you to want me to go back but the old life will never know me again i have reached here the goal of all my ambitions i am entirely happy and contented here i shall remain for the remainder of my days you see this robe that i wear bellchambers caressingly touched the straight hanging garment at last i have found something that will not bag at the knees i have attained at that moment the deep boom of the great brass bell reverberated through the monastery it must have been a summons to immediate devotions for brother ambrose bowed his head turned and left the chamber without another word a slight wave of his hand as he passed through the stone doorway seemed to say a farewell to his old friends they left the monastery without seeing him again and this is the story that tommy eyres and lancelot gilliam brought back with them from their latest european tour the girl and the graft the other day i ran across my old friend ferguson pogue pogue is a conscientious grafter of the highest type his headquarters is the western hemisphere and his line of business is anything from speculating in town lots on the great staked plains to selling wooden toys in connecticut made by hydraulic pressure from nutmegs ground to a pulp now and then when pogue has made a good haul he comes to new york for a rest he says the jug of wine and loaf of bread and thou in the wilderness business is about as much rest and pleasure to him as sliding down the bumps at coney would be to president taft give me says pogue a big city for my vacation especially new york i m not much fond of new yorkers and manhattan is about the only place on the globe where i don t find any while in the metropolis pogue can always be found at one of two places one is a little second hand bookshop on fourth avenue where he reads books about his hobbies mahometanism and taxidermy i found him at the other his hall bedroom in eighteenth street where he sat in his stocking feet trying to pluck the banks of the wabash out of a small zither four years he has practised this tune without arriving near enough to cast the longest trout line to the water s edge on the dresser lay a blued steel colt s forty five and a tight roll of tens and twenties large enough around to belong to the spring rattlesnake story class a chambermaid with a room cleaning air fluttered nearby in the hall unable to enter or to flee scandalized by the stocking feet aghast at the colt s yet powerless with her metropolitan instincts to remove herself beyond the magic influence of the yellow hued roll i sat on his trunk while ferguson pogue talked no one could be franker or more candid in his conversation beside his expression the cry of henry james for lacteal nourishment at the age of one month would have seemed like a chaldean cryptogram he told me stories of his profession with pride for he considered it an art and i was curious enough to ask him whether he had known any women who followed it ladies said pogue with western chivalry well not to any great extent they don t amount to much in special lines of graft because they re all so busy in general lines what why they have to who s got the money in the world the men did you ever know a man to give a woman a dollar without any consideration a man will shell out his dust to another man free and easy and gratis but if he drops a penny in one of the machines run by the madam eve s daughters amalgamated association and the pineapple chewing gum don t fall out when he pulls the lever you can hear him kick to the superintendent four blocks away man is the hardest proposition a woman has to go up against he s the low grade one and she has to work overtime to make him pay two times out of five she s salted she can t put in crushers and costly machinery he d notice em and be onto the game they have to pan out what they get and it hurts their tender hands some of em are natural sluice troughs and can carry out to the ton the dry eyed ones have to depend on signed letters false hair sympathy the kangaroo walk cowhide whips ability to cook sentimental juries conversational powers silk underskirts ancestry rouge anonymous letters violet sachet powders witnesses revolvers pneumatic forms carbolic acid moonlight cold cream and the evening newspapers you are outrageous ferg i said surely there is none of this graft as you call it in a perfect and harmonious matrimonial union well said pogue nothing that would justify you every time in calling police headquarters and ordering out the reserves and a vaudeville manager on a dead run but it s this way suppose you re a fifth avenue millionaire soaring high on the right side of copper and cappers you come home at night and bring a diamond brooch to the lady who s staked your for a claim you hand it over she says oh george and looks to see if it s backed she comes up and kisses you you ve waited for it you get it all right it s graft but i m telling you about artemisia blye she was from kansas and she suggested corn in all of its phases her hair was as yellow as the silk her form was as tall and graceful as a stalk in the low grounds during a wet summer her eyes were as big and startling as bunions and green was her favorite color on my last trip into the cool recesses of your sequestered city i met a human named vaucross he was worth that is he had a million he told me he was in business on the street a sidewalk merchant says i sarcastic exactly says he senior partner of a paving concern i kind of took to him for this reason i met him on broadway one night when i was out of heart luck tobacco and place he was all silk hat diamonds and front he was all front if you had gone behind him you would have only looked yourself in the face i looked like a cross between count tolstoy and a june lobster i was out of luck i had but let me lay my eyes on that dealer again vaucross stopped and talked to me a few minutes and then he took me to a high toned restaurant to eat dinner there was music and then some beethoven and bordelaise sauce and cussing in french and frangipangi and some hauteur and cigarettes when i am flush i know them places i declare i must have looked as bad as a magazine artist sitting there without any money and my hair all rumpled like i was booked to read a chapter from elsie s school days at a brooklyn bohemian smoker but vaucross treated me like a bear hunter s guide he wasn t afraid of hurting the waiter s feelings mr pogue he explains to me i am using you go on says i i hope you don t wake up and then he tells me you know the kind of man he was he was a new yorker his whole ambition was to be noticed he wanted to be conspicuous he wanted people to point him out and bow to him and tell others who he was he said it had been the desire of his life always he didn t have but a million so he couldn t attract attention by spending money he said he tried to get into public notice one time by planting a little public square on the east side with garlic for free use of the poor but carnegie heard of it and covered it over at once with a library in the gaelic language three times he had jumped in the way of automibiles but the only result was five broken ribs and a notice in the papers that an unknown man five feet ten with four amalgam filled teeth supposed to be the last of the famous red leary gang had been run over ever try the reporters i asked him last month says mr vaucross my expenditure for lunches to reporters was get anything out of that i asks that reminds me says he add for perpsin yes i got indigestion how am i supposed to push along your scramble for prominence i inquires contrast something of that sort to night says vaucross it grieves me but i am forced to resort to eccentricity and here he drops his napkin in his soup and rises up and bows to a gent who is devastating a potato under a palm across the room the police commissioner says my climber gratified friend says i in a hurry have ambitions but don t kick a rung out of your ladder when you use me as a stepping stone to salute the police you spoil my appetite on the grounds that i may be degraded and incriminated be thoughtful at the quaker city squab en casserole the idea about artemisia blye comes to me suppose i can manage to get you in the papers says i a column or two every day in all of em and your picture in most of em for a week how much would it be worth to you ten thousand dollars says vaucross warm in a minute but no murder says he and i won t wear pink pants at a cotillon i wouldn t ask you to says i this is honorable stylish and uneffiminate tell the waiter to bring a demi tasse and some other beans and i will disclose to you the opus moderandi we closed the deal an hour later in the rococo rouge et noise room i telegraphed that night to miss artemisia in salina she took a couple of photographs and an autograph letter to an elder in the fourth presbyterian church in the morning and got some transportation and she stopped in topeka long enough to trade a flashlight interior and a valentine to the vice president of a trust company for a mileage book and a package of five dollar notes with scrawled on the band the fifth evening after she got my wire she was waiting all d ecollet ee and dressed up for me and vaucross to take her to dinner in one of these new york feminine apartment houses where a man can t get in unless he plays bezique and smokes depilatory powder cigarettes she s a stunner says vaucross when he saw her they ll give her a two column cut sure this was the scheme the three of us concocted it was business straight through vaucross was to rush miss blye with all the style and display and emotion he could for a month of course that amounted to nothing as far as his ambitions were concerned the sight of a man in a white tie and patent leather pumps pouring greenbacks through the large end of a cornucopia to purchase nutriment and heartsease for tall willowy blondes in new york is as common a sight as blue turtles in delirium tremens but he was to write her love letters the worst kind of love letters such as your wife publishes after you are dead every day at the end of the month he was to drop her and she would bring suit for for breach of promise miss artemisia was to get if she won the suit that was all and if she lost she was to get it anyhow there was a signed contract to that effect sometimes they had me out with em but not often i couldn t keep up to their style she used to pull out his notes and criticize them like bills of lading say you she d say what do you call this letter to a hardware merchant from his nephew on learning that his aunt has nettlerash you eastern duffers know as much about writing love letters as a kansas grasshopper does about tugboats my dear miss blye wouldn t that put pink icing and a little red sugar bird on your bridal cake how long do you expect to hold an audience in a court room with that kind of stuff you want to get down to business and call me tweedlums babe and honeysuckle and sing yourself mama s own big bad puggy wuggy boy if you want any limelight to concentrate upon your sparse gray hairs get sappy after that vaucross dipped his pen in the indelible tabasco his notes read like something or other in the original i could see a jury sitting up and women tearing one another s hats to hear em read and i could see piling up for mr vaucross as much notoriousness as archbishop crammer or the brooklyn bridge or cheese on salad ever enjoyed he seemed mighty pleased at the prospects they agreed on a night and i stood on fifth avenue outside a solemn restaurant and watched em a process server walked in and handed vaucross the papers at this table everybody looked at em and he looked as proud as cicero i went back to my room and lit a five cent cigar for i knew the was as good as ours about two hours later somebody knocked at my door there stood vaucross and miss artemisia and she was clinging yes sir clinging to his arm and they tells me they d been out and got married and they articulated some trivial cadences about love and such and they laid down a bundle on the table and said good night and left and that s why i say concluded ferguson pogue that a woman is too busy occupied with her natural vocation and instinct of graft such as is given her for self preservation and amusement to make any great success in special lines what was in the bundle they left i asked with my usual curiosity why said ferguson there was a scalper s railroad ticket as far as kansas city and two pairs of mr vaucross s old pants the call of the tame when the inauguration was accomplished the proceedings were made smooth by the presence of the rough riders it is well known that a herd of those competent and loyal ex warrriors paid a visit to the big city the newspaper reporters dug out of their trunks the old broad brimmed hats and leather belts that they wear to north beach fish fries and mixed with the visitors no damage was done beyond the employment of the wonderful plural tenderfeet in each of the scribe s stories the westerners mildly contemplated the skyscrapers as high as the third story yawned at broadway hunched down in the big chairs in hotel corridors and altogether looked as bored and dejected as a member of ye ancient and honorable artillery separated during a sham battle from his valet out of this sightseeing delegations of good king teddy s gentlemen of the royal bear hounds dropped one greenbrier nye of pin feather ariz the daily cyclone of sixth avenue s rush hour swept him away from the company of his pardners true the dust from a thousand rustling skirts filled his eyes the mighty roar of trains rushing across the sky deafened him the lightning flash of twice ten hundred beaming eyes confused his vision the storm was so sudden and tremendous that greenbrier s first impulse was to lie down and grab a root and then he remembered that the disturbance was human and not elemental and he backed out of it with a grin into a doorway the reporters had written that but for the widebrimmed hats the west was not visible upon these gauchos of the north heaven sharpen their eyes the suit of black diagonal wrinkled in impossible places the bright blue four in hand factory tied the low turned down collar pattern of the days of seymour and blair white glazed as the letters on the window of the open day and night except sunday restaurants the out curve at the knees from the saddle grip the peculiar spread of the half closed right thumb and fingers from the stiff hold upon the circling lasso the deeply absorbed weather tan that the hottest sun of cape may can never equal the seldom winking blue eyes that unconsciously divided the rushing crowds into fours as though they were being counted out of a corral the segregated loneliness and solemnity of expression as of an emperor or of one whose horizons have not intruded upon him nearer than a day s ride these brands of the west were set upon greenbrier nye oh yes he wore a broadbrimmed hat gentle reader just like those the madison square post office mail carriers wear when they go up to bronx park on sunday afternoons suddenly greenbrier nye jumped into the drifting herd of metropolitan cattle seized upon a man dragged him out of the stream and gave him a buffet upon his collarbone that sent him reeling against a wall the victim recovered his hat with the angry look of a new yorker who has suffered an outrage and intends to write to the trib about it but he looked at his assailant and knew that the blow was in consideration of love and affection after the manner of the west which greets its friends with contumely and uproar and pounding fists and receives its enemies in decorum and order such as the judicious placing of the welcoming bullet demands god in the mountains cried greenbrier holding fast to the foreleg of his cull can this be longhorn merritt the other man was oh look on broadway any day for the pattern business man latest rolled brim derby good barber business digestion and tailor greenbrier nye he exclaimed grasping the hand that had smitten him my dear fellow so glad to see you how did you come to oh to be sure the inaugural ceremonies i remember you joined the rough riders you must come and have luncheon with me of course greenbrier pinned him sadly but firmly to the wall with a hand the size shape and color of a mcclellan saddle longy he said in a melancholy voice that disturbed traffic what have they been doing to you you act just like a citizen they done made you into an inmate of the city directory you never made no such johnny branch execration of yourself as that out on the gila come and have lunching with me you never defined grub by any such terms of reproach in them days i ve been living in new york seven years said merritt it s been eight since we punched cows together in old man garcia s outfit well let s go to a caf e anyhow it sounds good to hear it called grub again they picked their way through the crowd to a hotel and drifted as by a natural law to the bar speak up invited greenbrier a dry martini said merritt oh lord cried greenbrier and yet me and you once saw the same pink gila monsters crawling up the walls of the same hotel in canon diablo a dry but let that pass whiskey straight and they re on you merritt smiled and paid they lunched in a small extension of the dining room that connected with the caf e merritt dexterously diverted his friend s choice that hovered over ham and eggs to a pur ee of celery a salmon cutlet a partridge pie and a desirable salad on the day said greenbrier grieved and thunderous when i can t hold but one drink before eating when i meet a friend i ain t seen in eight years at a by table in a thirty cent town at o clock on the third day of the week i want nine broncos to kick me forty times over a acre section of land get them statistics right old man laughed merritt waiter bring an absinthe frapp e and what s yours greenbrier whiskey straight mourned nye

future we ll take in the theatre to night greenbrier and after that we ll dine at i ll tell you what you are merritt said greenbrier laying one elbow in his salad and the other in his butter you are a

his handiwork to elapse by removing yourself to new york and putting on little shoes tied with strings and making faces when you talk i ve seen you rope and tie a steer in if you was to see one now you d write to the police commissioner about it and these flapdoodle drinks that you inoculate your system with these little essences of cowslip with acorns in em and paregoric flip they ain t anyways in assent with the cordiality of manhood i hate to see you this way well mr greenbrier said merritt with apology in his tone in a way you are right sometimes i do feel like i was being raised on the bottle but i tell you new york is comfortable comfortable there s something about it the sights and the crowds and the way it changes every day and the very air of it that seems to tie a one mile long stake rope around a man s neck with the other end fastened somewhere about thirty fourth street i don t know what it is god knows said greenbrier sadly and i know the east has gobbled you up you was venison and now you re veal you put me in mind of a japonica in a window you ve been signed sealed and diskivered requiescat in hoc signo you make me thirsty a green chartreuse here said merritt to the waiter whiskey straight sighed greenbrier and they re on you you renegade of the round ups guilty with an application for mercy said merritt you don t know how it is greenbrier it s so comfortable here that please loan me your smelling salts pleaded greenbrier if i hadn t seen you once bluff three bluffers from mazatzal city with an empty gun in phoenix greenbrier s voice died away in pure grief cigars he called harshly to the waiter to hide his emotion a pack of turkish cigarettes for mine said merritt they re on you chanted greenbrier struggling to conceal his contempt at seven they dined in the where to dine well column that evening a galaxy had assembled there bright shone the lights o er fair women and br let it go anyhow brave men the orchestra played charmingly hardly had a tip from a diner been placed in its hands by a waiter when it would burst forth into soniferousness the more beer you contributed to it the more meyerbeer it gave you which is reciprocity merritt put forth exertions on the dinner greenbrier was his old friend and he liked him he persuaded him to drink a cocktail i take the horehound tea said greenbrier for old times sake but i d prefer whiskey straight they re on you right said merritt now run your eye down that bill of fare and see if it seems to hitch on any of these items lay me on my lava bed said greenbrier with bulging eyes all these specimens of nutriment in the grub wagon what s this horse with the heaves i pass but look along here s truck for twenty roundups all spelled out in different directions wait till i see the viands ordered merritt turned to the wine list this medoc isn t bad he suggested you re the doc said greenbrier i d rather have whiskey straight it s on you greenbrier looked around the room the waiter brought things and took dishes away he was observing he saw a new york restaurant crowd enjoying itself how was the range when you left the gila asked merritt fine said greenbrier you see that lady in the red speckled silk at that table well she could warm over her beans at my campfire yes the range was good she looks as nice as a white mustang i see once on black river when the coffee came greenbrier put one foot on the seat of the chair next to him you said it was a comfortable town longy he said meditatively yes it s a comfortable town it s different from the plains in a blue norther what did you call that mess in the crock with the handle longy oh yes squabs in a cash roll they re worth the roll that white mustang had just such a way of turning his head and shaking his mane look at her longy if i thought i could sell out my ranch at a fair price i believe i d gyar song he suddenly cried in a voice that paralyzed every knife and fork in the restaurant the waiter dived toward the table two more of them cocktail drinks ordered greenbrier merritt looked at him and smiled significantly they re on me said greenbrier blowing a puff of smoke to the ceiling the unknown quantity the poet longfellow or was it confucius the inventor of wisdom remarked life is real life is earnest and things are not what they seem as mathematics are or is thanks old subscriber the only just rule by which questions of life can be measured let us by all means adjust our theme to the straight edge and the balanced column of the great goddess two and two makes four figures unassailable sums in addition shall be set over against whatever oposing element there may be a mathematician after scanning the above two lines of poetry would say ahem young gentlemen if we assume that x plus that is that life is real then things all of which life includes are real anything that is real is what it seems then if we consider the proposition that things are not what they seem why but this is heresy and not poesy we woo the sweet nymph algebra we would conduct you into the presence of the elusive seductive pursued satisfying mysterious x not long before the beginning of this century septimus kinsolving an old new yorker invented an idea he originated the discovery that bread is made from flour and not from wheat futures perceiving that the flour crop was short and that the stock exchange was having no perceptible effect on the growing wheat mr kinsolving cornered the flour market the result was that when you or my landlady before the war she never had to turn her hand to anything southerners accomodated bought a five cent load of bread you laid down an additional two cents which went to mr kinsolving as a testimonial to his perspicacity a second result was that mr kinsolving quit the game with prof er rake off mr kinsolving s son dan was at college when the mathematical experiment in breadstuffs was made dan came home during vacation and found the old gentleman in a red dressing gown reading little dorrit on the porch of his estimable red brick mansion in washington square he had retired from business with enough extra two cent pieces from bread buyers to reach if laid side by side fifteen times around the earth and lap as far as the public debt of paraguay dan shook hands with his father and hurried over to greenwich village to see his old high school friend kenwitz dan had always admired kenwitz kenwitz was pale curly haired intense serious mathematical studious altruistic socialistic and the natural foe of oligarchies kenwitz had foregone college and was learning watch making in his father s jewelry store dan was smiling jovial easy tempered and tolerant alike of kings and ragpickers the two foregathered joyously being opposites and then dan went back to college and kenwitz to his mainsprings and to his private library in the rear of the jewelry shop four years later dan came back to washington square with the accumulations of b a and two years of europe thick upon him he took a filial look at septimus kinsolving s elaborate tombstone in greenwood and a tedious excursion through typewritten documents with the family lawyer and then feeling himself a lonely and hopeless millionaire hurried down to the old jewelry store across sixth avenue kenwitz unscrewed a magnifying glass from his eye routed out his parent from a dingy rear room and abandoned the interior of watches for outdoors he went with dan and they sat on a bench in washington square dan had not changed much he was stalwart and had a dignity that was inclined to relax into a grin kenwitz was more serious more intense more learned philosophical and socialistic i know about it now said dan finally i pumped it out of the eminent legal lights that turned over to me poor old dad s collections of bonds and boodle it amounts to ken and i am told that he squeezed it out of the chaps that pay their pennies for loaves of bread at little bakeries around the corner you ve studied economics dan and you know all about monopolies and the masses and octopuses and the rights of laboring people i never thought about those things before football and trying to be white to my fellowman were about the extent of my college curriculum but since i came back and found out how dad made his money i ve been thinking i d like awfully well to pay back those chaps who had to give up too much money for bread i know it would buck the line of my income for a good many yards but i d like to make it square with em is there any way it can be done old ways and means kenwitz s big black eyes glowed fierily his thin intellectual face took on almost a sardonic cast he caught dan s arm with the grip of a friend and a judge you can t do it he said emphatically one of the chief punishments of you men of ill gotten wealth is that when you do repent you find that you have lost the power to make reparation or restitution i admire your good intentions dan but you can t do anything those people were robbed of their precious pennies it s too late to remedy the evil you can t pay them back of course said dan lighting his pipe we couldn t hunt up every one of the duffers and hand em back the right change there s an awful lot of em buying bread all the time funny taste they have i never cared for bread especially except for a toasted cracker with the roquefort but we might find a few of em and chuck some of dad s cash back where it came from i d feel better if i could it seems tough for people to be held up for a soggy thing like bread one wouldn t mind standing a rise in broiled lobsters or deviled crabs get to work and think ken i want to pay back all that money i can there are plenty of charities said kenwitz mechanically easy enough said dan in a cloud of smoke i suppose i could give the city a park or endow an asparagus bed in a hospital but i don t want paul to get away with the proceeds of the gold brick we sold peter it s the bread shorts i want to cover ken the thin fingers of kenwitz moved rapidly do you know how much money it would take to pay back the losses of consumers during that corner in flour he asked i do not said dan stoutly my lawyer tells me that i have two millions if you had a hundred millions said kenwitz vehemently you couldn t repair a thousandth part of the damage that has been done you cannot conceive of the accumulated evils produced by misapplied wealth each penny that was wrung from the lean purses of the poor reacted a thousandfold to their harm you do not understand you do not see how hopeless is your desire to make restitution not in a single instance can it be done back up philosopher said dan the penny has no sorrow that the dollar cannot heal not in one instance repeated kenwitz i will give you one and let us see thomas boyne had a little bakery over there in varick street he sold bread to the poorest people when the price of flour went up he had to raise the price of bread his customers were too poor to pay it boyne s business failed and he lost his capital all he had in the world dan kinsolving struck the park bench a mighty blow with his fist i accept the instance he cried take me to boyne i will repay his thousand dollars and buy him a new bakery write your check said kenwitz without moving and then begin to write checks in payment of the train of consequences draw the next one for boyne went insane after his failure and set fire to the building from which he was about to be evicted the loss amounted to that much boyne died in an asylum stick to the instance said dan i haven t noticed any insurance companies on my charity list draw your next check for went on kenwitz boyne s son fell into bad way after the bakery closed and was accused of murder he was acquitted last week after a three years legal battle and the state draws upon taxpayers for that much expense back to the bakery exclaimed dan impatiently the government doesn t need to stand in the bread line the last item of the instance is come and i will show you said kenwitz rising the socialistic watchmaker was happy he was a millionaire baiter by nature and a pessimist by trade kenwitz would assure you in one breath that money was but evil and corruption and that your brand new watch needed cleaning and a new ratchet wheel he conducted kinsolving southward out of the square and into ragged poverty haunted varick street up the narrow stairway of a squalid brick tenement he led the penitent offspring of the octupus he knocked on a door and a clear voice called to them to enter in that almost bare room a young woman sat sewing at a machine she nodded to kenwitz as to a familiar acquaintance one little stream of sunlight through the dingy window burnished her heavy hair to the color of an ancient tuscan s shield she flashed a rippling smile at kenwitz and a look of somewhat flustered inquiry kinsolving stood regarding her clear and pathetic beauty in heart throbbing silence thus they came into the presence of the last item of the instance how many this week miss mary asked the watchmaker a mountain of coarse gray shirts lay upon the floor nearly thirty dozen said the young woman cheerfully i ve made almost i m improving mr kenwitz i hardly know what to do with so much money her eyes turned brightly soft in the direction of dan a little pink spot came out on her round pale cheek kenwitz chuckled like a diabolic raven miss boyne he said let me present mr kinsolving the son of the man who put bread up five years ago he thinks he would like to do something to aid those who where inconvenienced by that act the smile left the young woman s face she rose and pointed her forefinger toward the door this time she looked kinsolving straight in the eye but it was not a look that gave delight the two men went down varick street kenwitz letting all his pessimism and rancor and hatred of the octopus come to the surface gibed at the moneyed side of his friend in an acrid torrent of words dan appeared to be listening and then turned to kenwitz and shook hands with him warmly i m obliged to you ken old man he said vaguely a thousand times obliged mein gott you are crazy cried the watchmaker dropping his spectacles for the first time in years two months afterward kenwitz went into a large bakery on lower broadway with a pair of gold rimmed eyeglasses that he had mended for the proprietor a lady was giving an order to a clerk as kenwitz passed her these loaves are ten cents said the clerk i always get them at eight cents uptown said the lady you need not fill the order i will drive by there on my way home the voice was familiar the watchmaker paused mr kenwitz cried the lady heartily how do you do kenwitz was trying to train his socialistic and economic comprehension on her wonderful fur boa and the carriage waiting outside why miss boyne he began mrs kinsolving she corrected dan and i were married a month ago the thing s the play being acquainted with a newspaper reporter who had a couple of free passes i got to see the performance a few nights ago at one of the popular vaudeville houses one of the numbers was a violin solo by a striking looking man not much past forty but with very gray thick hair not being afflicted with a taste for music i let the system of noises drift past my ears while i regarded the man there was a story about that chap a month or two ago said the reporter they gave me the assignment it was to run a column and was to be on the extremely light and joking order the old man seems to like the funny touch i give to local happenings oh yes i m working on a farce comedy now well i went down to the house and got all the details but i certainly fell down on that job i went back and turned in a comic write up of an east side funeral instead why oh i couldn t seem to get hold of it with my funny hooks somehow maybe you could make a one act tragedy out of it for a curtain raiser i ll give you the details after the performance my friend the reporter recited to me the facts over w urzburger i see no reason said i when he had concluded why that shouldn t make a rattling good funny story those three people couldn t have acted in a more absurd and preposterous manner if they had been real actors in a real theatre i m really afraid that all the stage is a world anyhow and all the players men and women the thing s the play is the way i quote mr shakespeare try it said the reporter i will said i and i did to show him how he could have made a humorous column of it for his paper there stands a house near abingdon square on the ground floor there has been for twenty five years a little store where toys and notions and stationery are sold one night twenty years ago there was a wedding in the rooms above the store the widow mayo owned the house and store her daughter helen was married to frank barry john delaney was best man helen was eighteen and her picture had been printed in a morning paper next to the headlines of a wholesale female murderess story from butte mont but after your eye and intelligence had rejected the connection you seized your magnifying glass and read beneath the portrait her description as one of a series of prominent beauties and belles of the lower west side frank barry and john delaney were prominent young beaux of the same side and bosom friends whom you expected to turn upon each other every time the curtain went up one who pays his money for orchestra seats and fiction expects this that is the first funny idea that has turned up in the story yet both had made a great race for helen s hand when frank won john shook his hand and congratulated him honestly he did after the ceremony helen ran upstairs to put on her hat she was getting married in a traveling dress she and frank were going to old point comfort for a week downstairs the usual horde of gibbering cave dwellers were waiting with their hands full of old congress gaiters and paper bags of hominy then there was a rattle of the fire escape and into her room jumps the mad and infatuated john delaney with a damp curl drooping upon his forehead and made violent and reprehensible love to his lost one entreating her to flee or fly with him to the riviera or the bronx or any old place where there are italian skies and dolce far niente it would have carried blaney off his feet to see helen repulse him with blazing and scornful eyes she fairly withered him by demanding whatever he meant by speaking to respectable people that way in a few moments she had him going the manliness that had possessed him departed he bowed low and said something about irresistible impulse and forever carry in his heart the memory of and she suggested that he catch the first fire escape going down i will away said john delaney to the furthermost parts of the earth i cannot remain near you and know that you are another s i will to africa and there amid other scenes strive to for for goodness sake get out said helen somebody might come in he knelt upon one knee and she extended him one white hand that he might give it a farewell kiss girls was this choice boon of the great little god cupid ever vouchsafed you to have the fellow you want hard and fast and have the one you don t want come with a damp curl on his forehead and kneel to you and babble of africa and love which in spite of everything shall forever bloom an amaranth in his heart to know your power and to feel the sweet security of your own happy state to send the unlucky one broken hearted to foreign climes while you congratulate yourself as he presses his last kiss upon your knuckles that your nails are well manicured say girls it s galluptious don t ever let it get by you and then of course how did you guess it the door opened and in stalked the bridegroom jealous of slow tying bonnet strings the farewell kiss was imprinted upon helen s hand and out of the window and down the fire escape sprang john delaney africa bound a little slow music if you please faint violin just a breath in the clarinet and a touch of the cello imagine the scene frank white hot with the cry of a man wounded to death bursting from him helen rushing and clinging to him trying to explain he catches her wrists and tears them from his shoulders once twice thrice he sways her this way and that the stage manager will show you how and throws her from him to the floor a huddled crushed moaning thing never he cries will he look upon her face again and rushes from the house through the staring groups of astonished guests and now because it is the thing instead of the play the audience must stroll out into the real lobby of the world and marry die grow gray rich poor happy or sad during the intermission of twenty years which must precede the rising of the curtain again mrs barry inherited the shop and the house at thirty eight she could have bested many an eighteen year old at a beauty show on points and general results only a few people remembered her wedding comedy but she made of it no secret she did not pack it in lavender or moth balls nor did she sell it to a magazine one day a middle aged money making lawyer who bought his legal cap and ink of her asked her across the counter to marry him i m really much obliged to you said helen cheerfully but i married another man twenty years ago he was more a goose than a man but i think i love him yet i have never seen him since about half an hour after the ceremony was it copying ink that you wanted or just writing fluid the lawyer bowed over the counter with old time grace and left a respectful kiss on the back of her hand helen sighed parting salutes however romantic may be overdone here she was at thirty eight beautiful and admired and all that she seemed to have got from her lovers were approaches and adieus worse still in the last one she had lost a customer too business languished and she hung out a room to let card two large rooms on the third floor were prepared for desirable tenants roomers came and went regretfully for the house of mrs barry was the abode of neatness comfort and taste one day came ramonti the violinist and engaged the front room above the discord and clatter uptown offended his nice ear so a friend had sent him to this oasis in the desert of noise ramonti with his still youthful face his dark eyebrows his short pointed foreign brown beard his distinguished head of gray hair and his artist s temperament revealed in his light gay and sympathetic manner was a welcome tenant in the old house near abingdon square helen lived on the floor above the store the architecture of it was singular and quaint the hall was large and almost square up one side of it and then across the end of it ascended an open stairway to the floor above this hall space she had furnished as a sitting room and office combined there she kept her desk and wrote her business letters and there she sat of evenings by a warm fire and a bright red light and sewed or read ramonti found the atmosphere so agreeable that he spent much time there describing to mrs barry the wonders of paris where he had studied with a particularly notorious and noisy fiddler next comes lodger no a handsome melancholy man in the early s with a brown mysterious beard and strangely pleading haunting eyes he too found the society of helen a desirable thing with the eyes of romeo and othello s tongue he charmed her with tales of distant climes and wooed her by respectful innuendo from the first helen felt a marvelous and compelling thrill in the presence of this man his voice somehow took her swiftly back to the days of her youth s romance this feeling grew and she gave way to it and it led her to an instinctive belief that he had been a factor in that romance and then with a woman s reasoning oh yes they do sometimes she leaped over common syllogism and theory and logic and was sure that her husband had come back to her for she saw in his eyes love which no woman can mistake and a thousand tons of regret and remorse which aroused pity which is perilously near to love requited which is the sine qua non in the house that jack built but she made no sign a husband who steps around the corner for twenty years and then drops in again should not expect to find his slippers laid out too conveniently near nor a match ready lighted for his cigar there must be expiation explanation and possibly execration a little purgatory and then maybe if he were properly humble he might be trusted with a harp and crown and so she made no sign that she knew or suspected and my friend the reporter could see nothing funny in this sent out on an assignment to write up a roaring hilarious brilliant joshing story of but i will not knock a brother let us go on with the story one evening ramonti stopped in helen s hall office reception room and told his love with the tenderness and ardor of the enraptured artist his words were a bright flame of the divine fire that glows in the heart of a man who is a dreamer and doer combined but before you give me an answer he went on before she could accuse him of suddenness i must tell you that ramonti is the only name i have to offer you my manager gave me that i do not know who i am or where i came from my first recollection is of opening my eyes in a hospital i was a young man and i had been there for weeks my life before that is a blank to me they told me that i was found lying in the street with a wound on my head and was brought there in an ambulance they thought i must have fallen and struck my head upon the stones there was nothing to show who i was i have never been able to remember after i was discharged from the hospital i took up the violin i have had success mrs barry i do not know your name except that i love you the first time i saw you i realized that you were the one woman in the world for me and oh a lot of stuff like that helen felt young again first a wave of pride and a sweet little thrill of vanity went all over her and then she looked ramonti in the eyes and a tremendous throb went through her heart she hadn t expected that throb it took her by surprise the musician had become a big factor in her life and she hadn t been aware of it mr ramonti she said sorrowfully this was not on the stage remember it was in the old home near abingdon square i m awfully sorry but i m a married woman and then she told him the sad story of her life as a heroine must do sooner or later either to a theatrical manager or to a reporter ramonti took her hand bowed low and kissed it and went up to his room helen sat down and looked mournfully at her hand well she might three suitors had kissed it mounted their red roan steeds and ridden away in an hour entered the mysterious stranger with the haunting eyes helen was in the willow rocker knitting a useless thing in cotton wool he ricocheted from the stairs and stopped for a chat sitting across the table from her he also poured out his narrative of love and then he said helen do you not remember me i think i have seen it in your eyes can you forgive the past and remember the love that has lasted for twenty years i wronged you deeply i was afraid to come back to you but my love overpowered my reason can you will you forgive me helen stood up the mysterious stranger held one of her hands in a strong and trembling clasp there she stood and i pity the stage that it has not acquired a scene like that and her emotions to portray for she stood with a divided heart the fresh unforgettable virginal love for her bridegroom was hers the treasured sacred honored memory of her first choice filled half her soul she leaned to that pure feeling honor and faith and sweet abiding romance bound her to it but the other half of her heart and soul was filled with something else a later fuller nearer influence and so the old fought against the new and while she hesitated from the room above came the soft racking petitionary music of a violin the hag music bewitches some of the noblest the daws may peck upon one s sleeve without injury but whoever wears his heart upon his tympanum gets it not far from the neck this music and the musician caller her and at her side honor and the old love held her back forgive me he pleaded twenty years is a long time to remain away from the one you say you love she declared with a purgatorial touch how could i tell he begged i will conceal nothing from you that night when he left i followed him i was mad with jealousy on a dark street i struck him down he did not rise i examined him his head had struck a stone i did not intend to kill him i was mad with love and jealousy i hid near by and saw an ambulance take him away although you married him helen who are you cried the woman with wide open eyes snatching her hand away don t you remember me helen the one who has always loved you best i am john delaney if you can forgive but she was gone leaping stumbling hurrying flying up the stairs toward the music and him who had forgotten but who had known her for his in each of his two existences and as she climbed up she sobbed cried and sang frank frank frank three mortals thus juggling with years as though they were billiard balls and my friend the reporter couldn t see anything funny in it a ramble in aphasia my wife and i parted on that morning in precisely our usual manner she left her second cup of tea to follow me to the front door there she plucked from my lapel the invisible strand of lint the universal act of woman to proclaim ownership and bade me to take care of my cold i had no cold next came her kiss of parting the lever kiss of domesticity flavored with young hyson there was no fear of the extemporaneous of variety spicing her infinite custom with the deft touch of long malpractice she dabbed awry my well set scarf pin and then as i closed the door i heard her morning slippers pattering back to her cooling tea when i set out i had no thought or premonition of what was to occur the attack came suddenly for many weeks i had been toiling almost night and day at a famous railroad law case that i won triumphantly but a few days previously in fact i had been digging away at the law almost without cessation for many years once or twice good doctor volney my friend and physician had warned me if you don t slacken up belford he said you ll go suddenly to pieces either your nerves or your brain will give way tell me does a week pass in which you do not read in the papers of a case of aphasia of some man lost wandering nameless with his past and his identity blotted out and all from that little brain clot made by overwork or worry i always thought said i that the clot in those instances was really to be found on the brains of the newspaper reporters doctor volney shook his head the disease exists he said you need a change or a rest court room office and home there is the only route you travel for recreation you read law books better take warning in time on thursday nights i said defensively my wife and i play cribbage on sundays she reads to me the weekly letter from her mother that law books are not a recreation remains yet to be established that morning as i walked i was thinking of doctor volney s words i was feeling as well as i usually did possibly in better spirits than usual i woke with stiff and cramped muscles from having slept long on the incommodious seat of a day coach i leaned my head against the seat and tried to think after a long time i said to myself i must have a name of some sort i searched my pockets not a card not a letter not a paper or monogram could i find but i found in my coat pocket nearly in bills of large denomination i must be some one of course i repeated to myself and began again to consider the car was well crowded with men among whom i told myself there must have been some common interest for they intermingled freely and seemed in the best good humor and spirits one of them a stout spectacled gentleman enveloped in a decided odor of cinnamon and aloes took the vacant half of my seat with a friendly nod and unfolded a newspaper in the intervals between his periods of reading we conversed as travelers will on current affairs i found myself able to sustain the conversation on such subjects with credit at least to my memory by and by my companion said you are one of us of course fine lot of men the west sends in this time i m glad they held the convention in new york i ve never been east before my name s r p bolder bolder son of hickory grove missouri though unprepared i rose to the emergency as men will when put to it now must i hold a christening and be at once babe parson and parent my senses came to the rescue of my slower brain the insistent odor of drugs from my compainion supplied one idea a glance at his newspaper where my eye met a conspicuous advertisement assisted me further my name said i glibly is edward pinkhammer i am a druggist and my home is in cornopolis kansas i knew you were a druggist said my fellow traveler affably i saw the callous spot on your right forefinger where the handle of the pestle rubs of course you are a delegate to our national convention are all these men druggists i asked wonderingly they are this car came through from the west and they re your old time druggists too none of your patent tablet and granule pharmashootists that use slot machines instead of a prescription desk we percolate our own paregoric and roll our own pills and we ain t above handling a few garden seeds in the spring and carrying a side line of confectionery and shoes i tell you hampinker i ve got an idea to spring on this convention new ideas is what they want now you know the shelf bottles of tartar emetic and rochelle salt ant et pot tart and sod et pot tart one s poison you know and the other s harmless it s easy to mistake one label for the other where do druggists mostly keep em why as far apart as possible on different shelves that s wrong i say keep em side by side so when you want one you can always compare it with the other and avoid mistakes do you catch the idea it seems to me a very good one i said all right when i spring it on the convention you back it up we ll make some of these eastern orange phosphate and massage cream professors that think they re the only lozenges in the market look like hypodermic tablets if i can be of any aid i said warming the two bottles of er tartrate of antimony and potash and tartrate of soda and potash shall henceforth sit side by side i concluded firmly now there s another thing said mr bolder for an excipient in manipulating a pill mass which do you prefer the magnesia carbonate or the pulverised glycerrhiza radix the er magnesia i said it was easier to say than the other word mr bolder glanced at me distrustfully through his spectacles give me the glycerrhiza said he magnesia cakes here s another one of these fake aphasia cases he said presently handing me his newspaper and laying his finger upon an article i don t believe in em i put nine out of ten of em down as frauds a man gets sick of his business and his folks and wants to have a good time he skips out somewhere and when they find him he pretends to have lost his memory don t know his own name and won t even recognize the strawberry mark on his wife s left shoulder aphasia tut why can t they stay at home and forget i took the paper and read after the pungent headlines the following denver june elwyn c belford a prominent lawyer is mysteriously missing from his home since three days ago and all efforts to locate him have been in vain mr bellford is a well known citizen of the highest standing and has enjoyed a large and lucrative law practice he is married and owns a fine home and the most extensive private library in the state on the day of his disappearance he drew quite a large sum of money from his bank no one can be found who saw him after he left the bank mr bellford was a man of singularly quiet and domestic tastes and seemed to find his happiness in his home and profession if any clue at all exists to his strange disappearance it my be found in the fact that for some months he has been deeply absorbed in an important law case in connection with the q y and z railroad company it is feared that overwork may have affected his mind every effort is being made to discover the whereabouts of the missing man it seems to me you are not altogether uncynical mr bolder i said after i had read the despatch this has the sound to me of a genuine case why should this man prosperous happily married and respected choose suddenly to abandon everything i know that these lapses of memory do occur and that men do find themselves adrift without a name a history or a home oh gammon and jalap said mr bolder it s larks they re after there s too much education nowadays men know about aphasia and they use it for an excuse the women are wise too when it s all over they look you in the eye as scientific as you please and say he hypnotized me thus mr bolder diverted but did not aid me with his comments and philosophy we arrived in new york about ten at night i rode in a cab to a hotel and i wrote my name edward pinkhammer in the register as i did so i felt pervade me a splendid wild intoxicating buoyancy a sense of unlimited freedom of newly attained possibilities i was just born into the world the old fetters whatever they had been were stricken from my hands and feet the future lay before me a clear road such as an infant enters and i could set out upon it equipped with a man s learning and experience i thought the hotel clerk looked at me five seconds too long i had no baggage the druggists convention i said my trunk has somehow failed to arrive i drew out a roll of money ah said he showing an auriferous tooth we have quite a number of the western delegates stopping here he struck a bell for the boy i endeavored to give color to my r ole there is an important movement on foot among us westerners i said in regard to a recommendation to the convention that the bottles containing the tartrate of antimoney and potash and the tartrate of sodium and potash be kept in a contiguous position on the shelf gentleman to three fourteen said the clerk hastily i was whisked away to my room the next day i bought a trunk and clothing and began to live the life of edward pinkhammer i did not tax my brain with endeavors to solve problems of the past it was a piquant and sparkling cup that the great island city held up to my lips i drank of it gratefully the keys of manhattan belong to him who is able to bear them you must be either the city s guest or its victim the following few days were as gold and silver edward pinkhammer yet counting back to his birth by hours only knew the rare joy of having come upon so diverting a world full fledged and unrestrained i sat entranced on the magic carpets provided in theatres and roof gardens that transported one into strange and delightful lands full of frolicsome music pretty girls and grotesque drolly extravagant parodies upon human kind i went here and there at my own dear will bound by no limits of space time or comportment i dined in weird cabarets at weirder tables d h te to the sound of hungarian music and the wild shouts of mercurial artists and sculptors or again where the night life quivers in the electric glare like a kinetoscopic picture and the millinery of the world and its jewels and the ones whom they adorn and the men who make all three possible are met for good cheer and the spectacular effect and among all these scenes that i have mentioned i learned one thing that i never knew before and that is that the key to liberty is not in the hands of license but convention holds it comity has a toll gate at which you must pay or you may not enter the land of freedom in all the glitter the seeming disorder the parade the abandon i saw this law unobtrusive yet like iron prevail therefore in manhattan you must obey these unwritten laws and then you will be freest of the free if you decline to be bound by them you put on shackles sometimes as my mood urged me i would seek the stately softly murmuring palm rooms redolent with high born life and delicate restraint in which to dine again i would go down to the waterways in steamers packed with vociferous bedecked unchecked love making clerks and shop girls to their crude pleasures on the island shores and there was always broadway glistening opulent wily varying desirable broadway growing upon one like an opium habit one afternoon as i entered my hotel a stout man with a big nose and a black mustache blocked my way in the corridor when i would have passed around him he greet me with offensive familiarity hello bellford he cried loudly what the deuce are you doing in new york didn t know anything could drag you away from that old book den of yours is mrs b along or is this a little business run alone eh you have made a mistake sir i said coldly releasing my hand from his grasp my name is pinkhammer you will excuse me the man dropped to one side apparently astonished as i walked to the clerk s desk i heard him call to a bell boy and say something about telegraph blanks you will give me my bill i said to the clerk and have my baggage brought down in half an hour i do not care to remain where i am annoyed by confidence men i moved that afternoon to another hotel a sedate old fashioned one on lower fifth avenue there was a restaurant a little way off broadway where one could be served almost al fresco in a tropic array of screening flora quiet and luxury and a perfect service made it an ideal place in which to take luncheon or refreshment one afternoon i was there picking my way to a table among the ferns when i felt my sleeve caught mr bellford exclaimed an amazingly sweet voice i turned quickly to see a lady seated alone a lady of about thirty with exceedingly handsome eyes who looked at me as though i had been her very dear friend you were about to pass me she said accusingly don t tell me you do not know me why should we not shake hands at least once in fifteen years i shook hands with her at once i took a chair opposite her at the table i summoned with my eyebrows a hovering waiter the lady was philandering with an orange ice i ordered a cr me de menthe her hair was reddish bronze you could not look at it because you could not look away from her eyes but you were conscious of it as you are conscious of sunset while you look into the profundities of a wood at twilight are you sure you know me i asked no she said smiling i was never sure of that what would you think i said a little anxiously if i were to tell you that my name is edward pinkhammer from cornopolis kansas what would i think she repeated with a merry glance why that you had not brought mrs bellford to new york with you of course i do wish you had i would have liked to see marian her voice lowered slightly you haven t changed much elwyn i felt her wonderful eyes searching mine and my face more closely yes you have she amended and there was a soft exultant note in her latest tones i see it now you haven t forgotten you haven t forgotten for a year or a day or an hour i told you you never could i poked my straw anxiously in the cr me de menthe i m sure i beg your pardon i said a little uneasy at her gaze but that is just the trouble i have forgotten i ve forgotten everything she flouted my denial she laughed deliciously at something she seemed to see in my face i ve heard of you at times she went on you re quite a big lawyer out west denver isn t it or los angeles marian must be very proud of you you knew i suppose that i married six months after you did you may have seen it in the papers the flowers alone cost two thousand dollars she had mentioned fifteen years fifteen years is a long time would it be too late i asked somewhat timorously to offer you congratulations not if you dare do it she answered with such fine intrepidity that i was silent and began to crease patterns on the cloth with my thumb nail tell me one thing she said leaning toward me rather eagerly a thing i have wanted to know for many years just from a woman s curiosity of course have you ever dared since that night to touch smell or look at white roses at white roses wet with rain and dew i took a sip of cr me de menthe it would be useless i suppose i said with a sigh for me to repeat that i have no recollection at all about these things my memory is completely at fault i need not say how much i regret it the lady rested her arms upon the table and again her eyes disdained my words and went traveling by their own route direct to my soul she laughed softly with a strange quality in the sound it was a laugh of happiness yes and of content and of misery i tried to look away from her you lie elwyn bellford she breathed blissfully oh i know you lie i gazed dully into the ferns my name is edward pinkhammer i said i came with the delegates to the druggists national convention there is a movement on foot for arranging a new position for the bottles of tartrate of antimony and tartrate of potash in which very likely you would take little interest a shining landau stopped before the entrance the lady rose i took her hand and bowed i am deeply sorry i said to her that i cannot remember i could explain but fear you would not understand you will not concede pinkhammer and i really cannot at all conceive of the the roses and other things good by mr bellford she said with her happy sorrowful smile as she stepped into her carriage i attended the theatre that night when i returned to my hotel a quiet man in dark clothes who seemed interested in rubbing his finger nails with a silk handkerchief appeared magically at my side mr pinkhammer he said giving the bulk of his attention to his forefinger may i request you to step aside with me for a little conversation there is a room here certainly i answered he conducted me into a small private parlor a lady and a gentleman were there the lady i surmised would have been unusually good looking had her features not been clouded by an expression of keen worry and fatigue she was of a style of figure and possessed coloring and features that were agreeable to my fancy she was in a traveling dress she fixed upon me an earnest look of extreme anxiety and pressed an unsteady hand to her bosom i think she would have started forward but the gentleman arrested her movement with an authoritative motion of his hand he then came himself to meet me he was a man of forty a little gray about the temples and with a strong thoughtful face bellford old man he said cordially i m glad to see you again of course we know everything is all right i warned you you know that you were overdoing it now you ll go back with us and be yourself again in no time i smiled ironically i havae been bellforded so often i said that it has lost its edge still in the end it may grow wearisome would you be willing at all to entertain the hypothesis that my name is edward pinkhammer and that i never saw you before in my life before the man could reply a wailing cry came from the woman she sprang past his detaining arm elwyn she sobbed and cast herself upon me and clung tight elwyn she cried again don t break my heart i am your wife call my name once just once i could see you dead rather than this way i unwound her arms respectfully but firmly madam i said severely pardon me if i suggest that you accept a resemblance too precipitately it is a pity i went on with an amused laugh as the thought occurred to me that this bellford and i could not be kept side by side upon the same shelf like tartrates of sodium and antimony for purposes of identification in order to understand the allusion i concluded airily it may be necessary for you to keep an eye on the proceedings of the druggists national convention the lady turned to her companion and grasped his arm what is it doctor volney oh what is it she moaned go to your room for a while i heard him say i will remain and talk with him his mind no i think not only a portion of the brain yes i am sure he will recover go to your room and leave me with him the lady disappeared the man in dark clothes also went outside still manicuring himself in a thoughtful way i think he waited in the hall i would like to talk with you a while mr pinkhammer if i may said the gentleman who remained very well if you care to i replied and will excuse me if i take it comfortably i am rather tired i stretched myself upon a couch by a window and lit a cigar he drew a chair nearby let us speak to the point he said soothingly your name is not pinkhammer i know that as well as you do i said coolly but a man must have a name of some sort i can assure you that i do not extravagantly admire the name of pinkhammer but when one christens one s self suddenly the fine names do not seem to suggest themselves but suppose it had been scheringhausen or scroggins i think i did very well with pinkhammer your name said the other man seriously is elwyn c bellford you are one of the first lawyers in denver you are suffering from an attack of aphasia which has caused you to forget your identity the cause of it was over application to your profession and perhaps a life too bare of natural recreation and pleasures the lady who has just left the room is your wife she is what i would call a fine looking woman i said after a judicial pause i particularly admire the shade of brown in her hair she is a wife to be proud of since your disappearance nearly two weeks ago she has scarcely closed her eyes we learned that you were in new york through a telegram sent by isidore newman a traveling man from denver he said that he had met you in a hotel here and that you did not recognize him i think i remember the occasion i said the fellow called me bellford if i am not mistaken but don t you think it about time now for you to introduce yourself i am robert volney doctor volney i have been your close friend for twenty years and your physician for fifteen i came with mrs bellford to trace you as soon as we got the telegram try elwyn old man try to remember what s the use to try i asked with a little frown you say you are a physician is aphasia curable when a man loses his memory does it return slowly or suddenly sometimes gradually and imperfectly sometimes as suddenly as it went will you undertake the treatment of my case doctor volney i asked old friend said he i ll do everything in my power and wil have done everything that science can do to cure you very well said i then you will consider that i am your patient everything is in confidence now professional confidence of course said doctor volney i got up from the couch some one had set a vase of white roses on the centre table a cluster of white roses freshly sprinkled and fragrant i threw them far out of the window and then laid myself upon the couch again it will be best bobby i said to have this cure happen suddenly i m rather tired of it all anyway you may go now and bring marian in but oh doc i said with a sigh as i kicked him on the shin good old doc it was glorious a municipal report the cities are full of pride challenging each to each this from her mountainside that from her burthened beach r kipling fancy a novel about chicago or buffalo let us say or nashville tennessee there are justthree big cities in the united states that are story cities new york of course new orleans and best of the lot san francisco frank norris east is east and west is san francisco according to californians californians are a race of people they are not merely inhabitants of a state they are the southerners of the west now chicagoans are no less loyal to their city but when you ask them why they stammer and speak of lake fish and the new odd fellows building but californians go into detail of course they have in the climate an argument that is good for half an hour while you are thinking of your coal bills and heavy underwear but as soon as they come to mistake your silence for conviction madness comes upon them and they picture the city of the golden gate as the bagdad of the new world so far as a matter of opinion no refutation is necessary but dear cousins all from adam and eve descended it is a rash one who will lay his finger on the map and say in this town there can be no romance what could happen here yes it is a bold and a rash deed to challenge in one sentence history romance and rand and mcnally nashville a city port of delivery and the capital of the state of tennessee is on the cumberland river and on the n c st l and the l n railroads this city is regarded as the most important educational centre in the south i stepped off the train at p m having searched the thesaurus in vain for adjectives i must as a substitution hie me to comparison in the form of a recipe take a london fog parts malaria parts gas leaks parts dewdrops gathered in a brick yard at sunrise parts odor of honeysuckle parts mix the mixture will give you an approximate conception of a nashville drizzle it is not so fragrant as a moth ball nor as thick as pea soup but tis enough twill serve i went to a hotel in a tumbril it required strong self suppression for me to keep from climbing to the top of it and giving an imitation of sidney carton the vehicle was drawn by beasts of a bygone era and driven by something dark and emancipated i was sleepy and tired so when i got to the hotel i hurriedly paid it the fifty cents it demanded with approximate lagniappe i assure you i knew its habits and i did not want to hear it prate about its old marster or anything that happened befo de wah the hotel was one of the kind described as renovated that means worth of new marble pillars tiling electric lights and brass cuspidors in the lobby and a new l n time table and a lithograph of lookout mountain in each one of the great rooms above the management was without reproach the attention full of exquisite southern courtesy the service as slow as the progress of a snail and as good humored as rip van winkle the food was worth traveling a thousand miles for there is no other hotel in the world where you can get such chicken livers en brochette at dinner i asked a negro waiter if there was anything doing in town he pondered gravely for a minute and then replied well boss i don t really reckon there s anything at all doin after sundown sundown had been accomplished it had been drowned in the drizzle long before so that spectacle was denied me but i went forth upon the streets in the drizzle to see what might be there it is built on undulating grounds and the streets are lighted by electricity at a cost of per annum as i left the hotel there was a race riot down upon me charged a company of freedmen or arabs or zulus armed with no i saw with relief that they were not rifles but whips and i saw dimly a caravan of black clumsy vehicles and at the reassuring shouts kyar you anywhere in the town boss fuh fifty cents i reasoned that i was merely a fare instead of a victim i walked through long streets all leading uphill i wondered how those streets ever came down again perhaps they didn t until they were graded on a few of the main streets i saw lights in stores here and there saw street cars go by conveying worthy burghers hither and yon saw people pass engaged in the art of conversation and heard a burst of semi lively laughter issuing from a soda water and ice cream parlor the streets other than main seemed to have enticed upon their borders houses consecrated to peace and domesticity in many of them lights shone behind discreetly drawn window shades in a few pianos tinkled orderly and irreproachable music there was indeed little doing i wished i had come before sundown so i returned to my hotel in november the confederate general hood advanced against nashville where he shut up a national force under general thomas the latter then sallied forth and defeated the confederates in a terrible conflict all my life i have heard of admired and witnessed the fine marksmanship of the south in its peaceful conflicts in the tobacco chewing regions but in my hotel a surprise awaited me there were twelve bright new imposing capacious brass cuspidors in the great lobby tall enough to be called urns and so wide mouthed that the crack pitcher of a lady baseball team should have been able to throw a ball into one of them at five paces distant but although a terrible battle had raged and was still raging the enemy had not suffered bright new imposing capacious untouched they stood but shades of jefferson brick the tile floor the beautiful tile floor i could not avoid thinking of the battle of nashville and trying to draw as is my foolish habit some deductions about hereditary marksmanship here i first saw major by misplaced courtesy wentworth caswell i knew him for a type the moment my eyes suffered from the sight of him a rat has no geographical habitat my old friend a tennyson said as he so well said almost everything prophet curse me the blabbing lip and curse me the british vermin the rat let us regard the word british as interchangeable ad lib a rat is a rat this man was hunting about the hotel lobby like a starved dog that had forgotten where he had buried a bone he had a face of great acreage red pulpy and with a kind of sleepy massiveness like that of buddha he possessed one single virtue he was very smoothly shaven the mark of the beast is not indelible upon a man until he goes about with a stubble i think that if he had not used his razor that day i would have repulsed his advances and the criminal calendar of the world would have been spared the addition of one murder i happened to be standing within five feet of a cuspidor when major caswell opened fire upon it i had been observant enough to percieve that the attacking force was using gatlings instead of squirrel rifles so i side stepped so promptly that the major seized the opportunity to apologize to a noncombatant he had the blabbing lip in four minutes he had become my friend and had dragged me to the bar i desire to interpolate here that i am a southerner but i am not one by profession or trade i eschew the string tie the slouch hat the prince albert the number of bales of cotton destroyed by sherman and plug chewing when the orchestra plays dixie i do not cheer i slide a little lower on the leather cornered seat and well order another w urzburger and wish that longstreet had but what s the use major caswell banged the bar with his fist and the first gun at fort sumter re echoed when he fired the last one at appomattox i began to hope but then he began on family trees and demonstrated that adam was only a third cousin of a collateral branch of the caswell family genealogy disposed of he took up to my distaste his private family matters he spoke of his wife traced her descent back to eve and profanely denied any possible rumor that she may have had relations in the land of nod by this time i was beginning to suspect that he was trying to obscure by noise the fact that he had ordered the drinks on the chance that i would be bewildered into paying for them but when they were down he crashed a silver dollar loudly upon the bar then of course another serving was obligatory and when i had paid for that i took leave of him brusquely for i wanted no more of him but before i had obtained my release he had prated loudly of an income that his wife received and showed a handful of silver money when i got my key at the desk the clerk said to me courteously if that man caswell has annoyed you and if you would like to make a complaint we will have him ejected he is a nuisance a loafer and without any known means of support although he seems to have some money most the time but we don t seem to be able to hit upon any means of throwing him out legally why no said i after some reflection i don t see my way clear to making a complaint but i would like to place myself on record as asserting that i do not care for his company your town i continued seems to be a quiet one what manner of entertainment adventure or excitement have you to offer to the stranger within your gates well sir said the clerk there will be a show here next thursday it is i ll look it up and have the announcement sent up to your room with the ice water good night after i went up to my room i looked out the window it was only about ten o clock but i looked upon a silent town the drizzle continued spangled with dim lights as far apart as currants in a cake sold at the ladies exchange a quiet place i said to myself as my first shoe struck the ceiling of the occupant of the room beneath mine nothing of the life here that gives color and variety to the cities in the east and west just a good ordinary humdrum business town nashville occupies a foremost place among the manufacturing centres of the country it is the fifth boot and shoe market in the united states the largest candy and cracker manufacturing city in the south and does an enormous wholesale drygoods grocery and drug business i must tell you how i came to be in nashville and i assure you the digression brings as much tedium to me as it does to you i was traveling elsewhere on my own business but i had a commission from a northern literary magazine to stop over there and establish a personal connection between the publication and one of its contributors azalea adair adair there was no clue to the personality except the handwriting had sent in some essays lost art and poems that had made the editors swear approvingly over their one o clock luncheon so they had commissioned me to round up said adair and corner by contract his or her output at two cents a word before some other publisher offered her ten or twenty at nine o clock the next morning after my chicken livers en brochette try them if you can find that hotel i strayed out into the drizzle which was still on for an unlimited run at the first corner i came upon uncle caesar he was a stalwart negro older than the pyramids with gray wool and a face that reminded me of brutus and a second afterwards of the late king cettiwayo he wore the most remarkable coat that i ever had seen or expect to see it reached to his ankles an had once been a confederate gray in colors but rain and sun and age had so variegated it that joseph s coat beside it would have faded to a pale monochrome i must linger with that coat for it has to do with the story the story that is so long in coming because you can hardly expect anything to happen in nashville once it must have been the military coat of an officer the cape of it had vanished but all adown its front it had been frogged and tasseled magnificently but now the frogs and tassles were gone in their stead had been patiently stitched i surmised by some surviving black mammy new frogs made of cunningly twisted common hempen twine this twine was frayed and disheveled it must have been added to the coat as a substitute for vanished splendors with tasteless but painstaking devotion for it followed faithfully the curves of the long missing frogs and to complete the comedy and pathos of the garment all its buttons were gone save one the second button from the top alone remained the coat was fastened by other twine strings tied through the buttonholes and other holes rudely pierced in the opposite side there was never such a weird garment so fantastically bedecked and of so many mottled hues the lone button was the size of a half dollar made of yellow horn and sewed on with coarse twine this negro stood by a carriage so old that ham himself might have started a hack line with it after he left the ark with the two animals hitched to it as i approached he threw open the door drew out a feather duster waved it without using it and said in deep rumbling tones step right in suh ain t a speck of dust in it jus got back from a funeral suh i inferred that on such gala occasions carriages were given an extra cleaning i looked up and down the street and perceived that there was little choice among the vehicles for hire that lined the curb i looked in my memorandum book for the address of azalea adair i want to go to jessamine street i said and was about to step into the hack but for an instant the thick long gorilla like arm of the old negro barred me on his massive and saturnine face a look of sudden suspicion and enmity flashed for a moment then with quickly returning conviction he asked blandishingly what are you gwine there for boss what is it to you i asked a little sharply nothin suh jus nothin only it s a lonesome kind of part of town and few folks ever has business out there step right in the seats is clean jes got back from a funeral suh a mile and a half it must have been to our journey s end i could hear nothing but the fearful rattle of the ancient hack over the uneven brick paving i could smell nothing but the drizzle now further flavored with coal smoke and something like a mixture of tar and oleander blossoms all i could see through the streaming windows were two rows of dim houses the city has an area of square miles miles of streets of which miles are paved a system of waterworks that cost with miles of mains eight sixty one jessamine street was a decayed mansion thirty yards back from the street it stood outmerged in a splendid grove of trees and untrimmed shrubbery a row of box bushes overflowed and almost hid the paling fence from sight the gate was kept closed by a rope noose that encircled the gate post and the first paling of the gate but when you got inside you saw that was a shell a shadow a ghost of former grandeur and excellence but in the story i have not yet got inside when the hack had ceased from rattling and the weary quadrupeds came to a rest i handed my jehu his fifty cents with an additional quarter feeling a glow of conscious generosity as i did so he refused it it s two dollars suh he said how s that i asked i plainly heard you call out at the hotel fifty cents to any part of the town it s two dollars suh he repeated obstinately it s a long ways from the hotel it is within the city limits and well within them i argued don t think that you have picked up a greenhorn yankee do you see those hills over there i went on pointing toward the east i could not see them myself for the drizzle well i was born and raised on their other side you old fool nigger can t you tell people from other people when you see em the grim face of king cettiwayo softened is you from the south suh i reckon it was them shoes of yourn fooled me they is somethin sharp in the toes for a southern gen lman to wear then the charge is fifty cents i suppose said i inexorably his former expression a mingling of cupidity and hostility returned remained ten seconds and vanished boss he said fifty cents is right but i needs two dollars suh i m obleeged to have two dollars i ain t demandin it now suh after i know whar you s from i m jus sayin that i has to have two dollars to night and business mighty po peace and confidence settled upon his heavy features he had been luckier than he had hoped instead of having picked up a greenhorn ignorant of rates he had come upon an inheritance you confounded old rascal i said reaching down to my pocket you ought to be turned over to the police for the first time i saw him smile he knew he knew he knew i gave him two one dollar bills as i handed them over i noticed that one of them had seen parlous times its upper right hand corner was missing and it had been torn through the middle but joined again a strip of blue tissue paper pasted over the split preserved its negotiability enough of the african bandit for the present i left him happy lifted the rope and opened a creaky gate the house as i said was a shell a paint brush had not touched it in twenty years i could not see why a strong wind should not have bowled it over like a house of cards until i looked again at the trees that hugged it close the trees that saw the battle of nashville and still drew their protecting branches around it against storm and enemy and cold azalea adair fifty years old white haired a descendant of the cavaliers as thin and frail as the house she lived in robed in the cheapest and cleanest dress i ever saw with an air as simple as a queen s received me the reception room seemed a mile square because there was nothing in it except some rows of books on unpainted white pine bookshelves a cracked marble top table a rag rug a hairless horsehair sofa and two or three chairs yes there was a picture on the wall a colored crayon drawing of a cluster of pansies i looked around for the portrait of andrew jackson and the pinecone hanging basket but they were not there azalea adair and i had conversation a little of which will be repeated to you she was a product of the old south gently nurtured in the sheltered life her learning was not broad but was deep and of splendid originality in its somewhat narrow scope she had been educated at home and her knowledge of the world was derived from inference and by inspiration of such is the precious small group of essayists made whle she talked to me i kept brushing my fingers trying unconsciously to rid them guiltily of the absent dust from the half calf backs of lamb chaucer hazlitt marcus aurelius montaigne and hood she was exquisite she was a valuable discovery nearly everybody nowadays knows too much oh so much too much of real life i could perceive clearly that azalea adair was very poor a house and a dress she had not much else i fancied so divided between my duty to the magazine and my loyalty to the poets and essayists who fought thomas in the valley of the cumberland i listened to her voice which was like a harpsichord s and found that i could not speak of contracts in the presence of the nine muses and the three graces one hesitated to lower the topic to two cents there would have to be another colloquy after i had regained my commercialism but i spoke of my mission and three o clock of the next afternoon was set for the discussion of the business proposition your town i said as i began to make ready to depart which is the time for smooth generalities seems to be a quiet sedate place a home town i should say where few things out of the ordinary ever happen it carries on an extensive trade in stoves and hollow ware with the west and south and its flouring mills have a daily capacity of more than barrels azalea adair seemed to reflect i have never thought of it that way she said with a kind of sincere intensity that seemed to belong to her isn t it in the still quiet places that things do happen i fancy that when god began to create the earth on the first monday morning one could have leaned out one s window and heard the drops of mud splashing from his trowel as he built up the everlasting hills what did the noisiest project in the world i mean the building of the tower of bable result in finally a page and a half of esperanto in the north american review of course said i platitudinously human nature is the same everywhere but there is more color er more drama and movement and er romance in some cities than in others on the surface said azalea adair i have traveled many times around the world in a golden airship wafted on two wings print and dreams i have seen on one of my imaginary tours the sultan of turkey bowstring with his own hands one of his wives who had uncovered her face in public i have seen a man in nashville tear up his theatre tickets because his wife was going out with her face covered with rice powder in san francisco s chinatown i saw the slave girl sing yee dipped slowly inch by inch in boiling almond oil to make her swear she would never see her american lover again she gave in when the boiling oil had reached three inches above her knee at a euchre party in east nashville the other night i saw kitty morgan cut dead by seven of her schoolmates and lifelong friends because she had married a house painter the boiling oil was sizzling as high as her heart but i wish you could have seen the fine little smile that she carried from table to table oh yes it is a humdrum town just a few miles of red brick houses and mud and lumber yards some one knocked hollowly at the back of the house azalea adair breathed a soft apology and went to investigate the sound she came back in three minutes with brightened eyes a faint flush on her cheeks and ten years lifted from her shoulders you must have a cup of tea before you go she said and a sugar cake she reached and shook a little iron bell in shuffled a small negro girl about twelve barefoot not very tidy glowering at me with thumb in mouth and bulging eyes azlea adair opened a tiny worn purse and drew out a dollar bill a dollar bill with the upper right hand corner missing torn in two pieces and pasted together again with a strip of blue tissue paper it was one of the bills i had given the piratical negro there was no doubt about it go up to mr baker s store on the corner impy she said handing the girl the dollar bill and get a quarter of a pound of tea the kind he always sends me and ten cents worth of sugar cakes now hurry the supply of tea in the house happens to be exhausted she explained to me impy left by the back way before the scrape of her hard bare feet had died away on the back porch a wild shriek i was sure it was hers filled the hollow house then the deep gruff tones of an angry man s voice mingled with the girl s further squeals and unintelligible words azalea adair rose without surprise or emotion and disappeared for two minutes i heard the hoarse rumble of the man s voice then someting like an oath and a slight scuffle and she returned calmly to her chair this is a roomy house she said and i have a tenant for part of it i am sorry to have to rescind my invitation to tea it was impossible to get the kind i always use at the store perhaps to morrow mr baker will be able to supply me i was sure that impy had not had time to leave the house i inquired concerning street car lines and took my leave after i was well on my way i remembered that i had not learned azalea adair s name but to morrow would do that same day i started in on the course of iniquity that this uneventful city forced upon me i was in the town only two days but in that time i managed to lie shamelessly by telegraph and to be an accomplice after the fact if that is the correct legal term to a murder as i rounded the corner nearest my hotel the afrite coachman of the ploychromatic nonpareil coat seized me swung open the dungeony door of his peripatetic sarcophagus flirted his feather duster and began his ritual step right in boss carriage is clean jus got back from a funeral fifty cents to any and then he knew me and grinned broadly scuse me boss you is de gen l man what rid out with me dis mawnin thank you kindly suh i am going out to again to morrow afternoon at three said i and if you will be here i ll let you drive me so you know miss adair i concluded thinking of my dollar bill i belonged to her father judge adair suh he replied i judge that she is pretty poor i said she hasn t much money to speak of has she for an instant i looked again at the fierce countenance of king cettiwayo and then he changed back to an extortionate old negro hack driver she ain t gwine to starve suh he said slowly she has reso ces suh she has reso ces i shall pay you fifty cents for the trip said i dat is puffeckly correct suh he answered humbly i jus had to have dat two dollars dis mawnin boss i went to the hotel and lied by electricity i wired the magazine a adair holds out for eight cents a word the answer that came back was give it to her quick you duffer just before dinner major wentworth caswell bore down upon me with the greetings of a long lost friend i have seen few men whom i have so instantaneously hated and of whom it was so difficult to be rid i was standing at the bar when he invaded me therefore i could not wave the white ribbon in his face i would have paid gladly for the drinks hoping thereby to escape another but he was one of those despicable roaring advertising bibbers who must have brass bands and fireworks attend upon every cent that they waste in their follies with an air of producing millions he drew two one dollar bills from a pocket and dashed one of them upon the bar i looked once more at the dollar bill with the upper right hand corner missing torn through the middle and patched with a strip of blue tissue paper it was my dollar bill again it could have been no other i went up to my room the drizzle and the monotony of a dreary eventless southern town had made me tired and listless i remember that just before i went to bed i mentally disposed of the mysterious dollar bill which might have formed the clew to a tremendously fine detective story of san francisco by saying to myself sleepily seems as if a lot of people here own stock in the hack driver s trust pays dividends promptly too wonder if then i fell asleep king cettiwayo was at his post the next day and rattled my bones over the stones out to he was to wait and rattle me back again when i was ready azalea adair looked paler and cleaner and frailer than she had looked on the day before after she had signed the contract at eight cents per word she grew still paler and began to slip out of her chair whitout much trouble i managed to get her up on the antediluvian horsehair sofa and then i ran out to the sidewalk and yelled to the coffee colored pirate to bring a doctor with a wisdom that i had not expected in him he abandoned his team and struck off up the street afoot realizing the value of speed in ten minutes he returned with a grave gray haired and capable man of medicine in a few words worth much less than eight cents each i explained to him my presence in the hollow house of mystery he bowed with stately understanding and turned to the old negro uncle caesar he said calmly run up to my house and ask miss lucy to give you a cream pitcher full of fresh milk and half a tumbler of port wine and hurry back don t drive run i want you to get back sometime this week it occurred to me that dr merriman also felt a distrust as to the speeding powers of the land pirate s steeds after uncle caesar was gone lumberingly but swiftly up the street the doctor looked me over with great politeness and as much careful calculation until he had decided that i might do it is only a case of insufficient nutrition he said in other words the result of poverty pride and starvation mrs caswell has many devoted friends who would be glad to aid her but she will accept nothing except from that old negro uncle caesar who was once owned by her family mrs caswell said i in surprise and then i looked at the contract and saw that she had signed it azalea adair caswell i thought she was miss adair i said married to a drunken worthless loafer sir said the doctor it is said that he robs her even of the small sums that her old servant contributes toward her support when the milk and wine had been brought the doctor soon revived azalea adair she sat up and talked of the beauty of the autumn leaves that were then in season and their height of color she referred lightly to her fainting seizure as the outcome of an old palpitation of the heart impy fanned her as she lay on the sofa the doctor was due elsewhere and i followed him to the door i told him that it was within my power and intentions to make a reasonable advance of money to azalea adair on future contributions to the magazine and he seemed pleased by the way he said perhaps you would like to know that you have had royalty for a coachman old caesar s grandfather was a king in congo caesar himself has royal ways as you may have observed as the doctor was moving off i heard uncle caesar s voice inside did he get bofe of dem two dollars from you mis zalea yes caesar i heard azalea adair answer weakly and then i went in and concluded business negotiations with our contributor i assumed the responsibility of advancing fifty dollars putting it as a necessary formality in binding our bargain and then uncle caesar drove me back to the hotel here ends all of the story as far as i can testify as a witness the rest must be only bare statements of facts at about six o clock i went out for a stroll uncle caesar was at his corner he threw open the door of his carriage flourished his duster and began his depressing formula step right in suh fifty cents to anywhere in the city hack s puffickly clean suh jus got back from a funeral and then he recognized me i think his eyesight was getting bad his coat had taken on a few more faded shades of color the twine strings were more frayed and ragged the last remaining button the button of yellow horn was gone a motley descendant of kings was uncle caesar about two hours later i saw an excited crowd besieging the front of a drug store in a desert where nothing happens this was manna so i edged my way inside on an extemporized couch of empty boxes and chairs was stretched the mortal corporeality of major wentworth caswell a doctor was testing him for the immortal ingredient his decision was that it was conspicuous by its absence the erstwhile major had been found dead on a dark street and brought by curious and ennuied citizens to the drug store the late human being had been engaged in terrific battle the details showed that loafer and reprobate though he had been he had been also a warrior but he had lost his hands were yet clinched so tightly that his fingers would not be opened the gentle citizens who had know him stood about and searched their vocabularies to find some good words if it were possible to speak of him one kind looking man said after much thought when cas was about fo teen he was one of the best spellers in school while i stood there the fingers of the right hand of the man that was which hung down the side of a white pine box relaxed and dropped something at my feet i covered it with one foot quietly and a little later on i picked it up and pocketed it i reasoned that in his last struggle his hand must have seized that object unwittingly and held it in a death grip at the hotel that night the main topic of conversation with the possible exceptions of politics and prohibition was the demise of major caswell i heard one man say to a group of listeners in my opinion gentlemen caswell was murdered by somme of these no account niggers for his money he had fifty dollars this afternoon which he showed to several gentlemen in the hotel when he was found the money was not on his person i left the city the next morning at nine and as the train was crossing the bridge over the cumberland river i took out of my pocket a yellow horn overcoat button the size of a fifty cent piece with frayed ends of coarse twine hanging from it and cast it out of the window into the slow muddy waters below i wonder what s doing in buffalo psyche and the pskyscraper if you are a philosopher you can do this thing you can go to the top of a high building look down upon your fellow men feet below and despise them as insects like the irresponsible black waterbugs on summer ponds they crawl and circle and hustle about idiotically without aim or purpose they do not even move with the admirable intelligence of ants for ants always know when they are going home the ant is of a lowly station but he will often reach home and get his slippers on while you are left at your elevated station man then to the housetopped philosopher appears to be but a creeping contemptible beetle brokers poets millionaires bootblacks beauties hod carriers and politicians become little black specks dodging bigger black specks in streets no wider than your thumb from this high view the city itself becomes degraded to an unintelligible mass of distorted buildings and impossible perspectives the revered ocean is a duck pond the earth itself a lost golf ball all the minutiae of life are gone the philosopher gazes into the infinite heavens above him and allows his soul to expand to the influence of his new view he feels that he is the heir to eternity and the child of time space too should be his by the right of his immortal heritage and he thrills at the thought that some day his kind shall traverse theose mysterious aerial roads between planet and planet the tiny world beneath his feet upon which this towering structure of steel rests as a speck of dust upon a himalayan mountain it is but one of a countless number of such whirling atoms what are the ambitions the achievements the paltry conquests and loves of those restless black insects below compared with the serene and awful immensity of the universe that lies above and around their insignificant city it is guaranteed that the philosopher will have these thoughts they have been expressly compiled from the philosophies of the world and set down with the proper interrogation point at the end of them to represent the invariable musings of deep thinkers on high places and when the philosopher takes the elevator down his mind is broader his heart is at peace and his conception of the cosmogony of creation is as wide as the buckle of orion s summer belt but if your name happened to be daisy and you worked in an eighth avenue candy store and lived in a little cold hall bedroom five feet by eight and earned per week and ate ten cent lunches and were nineteen years old and got up at and worked till and never had studied philosophy maybe things wouldn t look that way to you from the top of a skyscraper two sighed for the hand of daisy the unphilosophical one was joe who kept the smallest store in new york it was about the size of a tool box of the d p w and was stuck like a swallow s nest against a corner of a down town skyscraper its stock consisted of fruit candies newspapers song books cigarettes and lemonade in season when stern winter shook his congealed locks and joe had to move himself and the fruit inside there was exactly room in the store for the proprietor his wares a stove the size of a vinegar cruet and one customer joe was not of the nation that keeps us forever in a furore with fugues and fruit he was a capable american youth who was laying by money and wanted daisy to help him spend it three times he had asked her i got money saved up daisy was his love song and you know how bad i want you that store of mine ain t very big but oh ain t it would be the antiphony of the unphilosophical one why i heard wanamaker s was trying to get you to sublet part of your floor space to them for next year daisy passed joe s corner every morning and evening hello two by four was her usual greeting seems to me your store looks emptier you must have sold a pack of chewing gum ain t much room in here sure joe would answer with his slow grin except for you daise me and the store are waitin for you whenever you ll take us don t you think you might before long store a fine scorn was expressed by daisy s uptilted nose sardine box waitin for me you say gee you d have to throw out about a hundred pounds of candy before i could get inside of it joe i wouldn t mind an even swap like that said joe complimentary daisy s existence was limited in every way she had to walk sideways between the counter and the shelves in the candy store in her own hall bedroom coziness had been carried close to cohesiveness the walls were so near to one another that the paper on them made a perfect babel of noise she could light the gas with one hand and close the door with the other without taking her eyes off the reflection of her brown pompadour in the mirror she had joe s picture in a gilt frame on the dresser and sometimes but her next thought would always be of joe s funny little store tacked like a soap box to the corner of that great building and away would go her sentiment in a breeze of laughter daisy s other suitor followed joe by several months he came to board in the house where she lived his name was dabster and he was a philosopher though young attainments stood out upon him like continental labels on a passaic n j suit case knowledge he had kidnapped from cyclopedias and handbooks of useful information but as for wisdom when she passed he was left sniffling in the road without so much as the number of her motor car he could and would tell you the proportion of water and muscle making properties of peas and veal the shortest verse in the bible the number of pounds of shingle nails required to fasten shingles laid four inches to the weather the population of kankakee ill the theories of spinoza the name of mr h mckay twombly s second hall footman the length of the hoosac tunnel the best time to set a hen the salary of the railway post office messenger between driftwood and red bank furnace pa and the number of bones in the foreleg of a cat the weight of learning was no handicap to dabster his statistics were the sprigs of parsley with which he garnished the feast of small talk that he would set before you if he conceived that to be your taste and again he used them as breastworks in foraging at the boardinghouse firing at you a volley of figures concerning the weight of a lineal foot of bar iron x inches and the average annual rainfall at fort snelling minn he would transfix with his fork the best piece of chicken on the dish while you were trying to rally sufficiently to ask him weakly why does a hen cross the road thus brightly armed and further equipped with a measure of good looks of a hair oily shopping district at three in the afternoon kind it seems that joe of the lilliputian emporium had a rival worthy of his steel but joe carried no steel there wouldn t have been room in his store to draw it if he had one saturday afternoon about four o clock daisy and mr dabster stopped before joe s booth dabster wore a silk hat and well daisy was a woman and that hat had no chance to get back in its box until joe had seen it a stick of pineapple chewing gum was the ostensible object of the call joe supplied it through the open side of his store he did not pale or falter at sight of the hat mr dabster s going to take me on top of the building to observe the view said daisy after she had introduced her admirers i never was on a skyscraper i guess it must be awfully nice and funny up there h m said joe the panorama said mr dabster exposed to the gaze from the top of a lofty building is not only sublime but instructive miss daisy has a decided pleasure in store for her it s windy up there too as well as here said joe are you dressed warm enough daise sure thing i m all lined said daisy smiling slyly at his clouded brow you look just like a mummy in a case joe ain t you just put in an invoice of a pint of peanuts or another apple your stock looks awful over stocked daisy giggled at her favorite joke and joe had to smile with her your quarters are somewhat limited mr er er remarked dabster in comparison with the size of this building i understand the area of its side to be about by feet that would make you occupy a proportionate space as if half of beloochistan were placed upon a territory as large as the united states east of the rocky mountains with the province of ontario and belgium added is that so sport said joe genially you are weisenheimer on figures all right how many square pounds of baled hay do you think a jackass could eat if he stopped brayin long enough to keep still a minute and five eighths a few minutes later daisy and mr dabster stepped from an elevator to the top floor of the skyscraper then up a short steep stairway and out upon the roof dabster led her to the parapet so she could look down at the black dots moving in the street below what are they she asked trembling she had never before been on a height like this before and then dabster must needs play the philosopher on the tower and conduct her soul forth to meet the immensity of space bipeds he said solemnly see what they become even at the small elevation of feet mere crawling insects going to and fro at random oh they ain t anything of the kind exclaimed daisy suddenly they re folks i saw an automobile oh gee are we that high up walk over this way said dabster he showed her the great city lying like an orderly array of toys far below starred here and there early as it was by the first beacon lights of the winter afternoon and then the bay and sea to the south and east vanishing mysteriously into the sky i don t like it declared daisy with troubled blue eyes say we go down but the philosopher was not to be denied his opportunity he would let her behold the grandeur of his mind the half nelson he had on the infinite and the memory he had for statistics and then she would nevermore be content to buy chewing gum aat the smallest store in new york and so he began to prate of the smallness of human affairs and how that even so slight a removal from earth made man and his works look like one tenth part of a dollar thrice computed and that one should consider the sidereal system and the maxims of epictetus and be comforted you don t carry me with you said daisy say i think it s awful to be up so high that folks look like fleas one of them we saw might have been joe why jiminy we might as well be in new jersey say i m afraid up here the philosopher smiled fatuously the earth said he is itself only as a grain of wheat in space look up there daisy gazed upward apprehensively the short day was spent and the stars were coming out above yonder star said dabster is venus the evening star she is miles from the sun fudge said daisy with a brief flash of spirit where do you think i come from brooklyn susie price in our store her brother sent her a ticket to go to san francisco that s only three thousand miles the philosopher smiled indulgently our world he said is miles from the sun there are eighteen stars of the first magnitude that are times further from us than the sun is if one of them should be extinguished it would be three years before we would see its light go out there are six thousand stars of the sixth magnitude it takes thirty six years for the light of one of them to reach the earth with an eighteen foot telescope we can see stars including those of the thirteenth magnitude whose light takes years to reach us each of these stars you re lyin cried daisy angrily you re tryin to scare me and you have i want to go down she stamped her foot arcturus began the philosopher soothingly but he was interrupted by a demonstration out of the vastness of the nature that he was endeavoring to portray with his memory instead of his heart for to the heart expounder of nature the stars were set in the firmament expressly to give soft light to lovers wandering happily beneath them and if you stand tiptoe some september night with your sweetheart on your arm you can almost touch them with your hand three years for their light to reach us indeed out of the west leaped a meteor lighting the roof of the skyscraper almost to midday its fiery parabola was limned against the sky toward the east it hissed as it went and daisy screamed take me down she cried vehemently you you mental arithmetic dabster got her to the elevator and inside of it she was wild eyed and she shuddered when the express made its debilitating drop outside the revolving door of the skyscraper the philosopher lost her she vanished and he stood bewildered without figures or statistics to aid him joe had a lull in trade and by squirming among his stock succeeded in lighting a cigarette and getting one cold foot against the attenuated stove the door was burst open and daisy laughing crying scattering fruit and candies tumbled into his arms oh joe i ve been up on the skyscraper ain t it cozy and warm and homelike in here i m ready for you joe whenever you want me a bird of bagdad without a doubt much of the spirit and genius of the caliph harun al rashid descended to the margrave august michael von paulsen quigg quigg s restaurant is in fourth avenue that street that the city seems to have forgotten in its growth fourth avenue born and bred in the bowery staggers northward full of good resolutions where it crosses fourteenth street it struts for a brief moment proudly in the glare of the museums and cheap theatres it may yet become a fit mate for its high born sister boulevard to the west or its roaring polyglot broad waisted cousin to the east it passes union square and here the hoofs of the dray horses seem to thunder in unison recalling the tread of marching hosts hooray but now come the silent and terrible mountains buildings square as forts high as the clouds shutting out the sky where thousands of slaves bend over desks all day on the ground floors are only little fruit shops and laundries and book shops where you see copies of littell s living age and g w m reynold s novels in the windows and next poor fourth avenue the street glides into a mediaeval solitude on each side are shops devoted to antiques let us say it is night men in rusty armor stand in the windows and menace the hurrying cars with raised rusty iron gauntlets hauberks and helms blunderbusses cromwellian breastplates matchlocks creeses and the swords and daggers of an army of dead and gone gallants gleam dully in the ghostly light here and there from a corner saloon lit with jack o lanterns or phosphorus stagger forth shuddering home bound citizens nerved by the tankards within to their fearsome journey adown that eldrich avenue lined with the bloodstained weapons of the fighting dead what street could live inclosed by these mortuary relics and trod by these spectral citizens in whose sunken hearts scarce one good whoop or tra la la remained not fourth avenue not after the tinsel but enlivening glories of the little rialto not after the echoing drum beats of union square there need be no tears ladies and gentlemen tis but the suicide of a street with a shriek and a crash fourth avenue dives headlong into the tunnel at thirty fourth and is never seen again near the sad scene of the thoroughfare s dissolution stood the modest restaurant of quigg it stands there yet if you care to view its crumbling red brick front its show window heaped with oranges tomatoes layer cakes pies canned asparagus its papier m ach e lobster and two maltese kittens asleep on a bunch of lettuce if you care to sit at one of the little tables upon whose cloth has been traced in the yellowest of coffee stains the trail of the japanese advance to sit there with one eye on your umbrella and the other upon the bogus bottle from which you drop the counterfeit sauce foisted upon us by the cursed charlatan who assumes to be our dear old lord and friend the nobleman in india quigg s title came through his mother one of her ancestors was a margravine of saxony his father was a tammany brave on account of the dilution of his heredity he found that he could neither become a reigning potentate nor get a job in the city hall so he opened a restaurant he was a man full of thought and reading the business gave him a living though he gave it little attention one side of his house bequeathed to him a poetic and romantic adventure the other have him the restless spirit that made him seek adventure by day he was quigg the restaurateur by night he was the margrave the caliph the prince of bohemia going about the city in search of the odd the mysterious the inexplicable the recondite one night at at which hour the restaurant closed quigg set forth upon his quest there was a mingling of the foreign the military and the artistic in his appearance as he buttoned his coat high up under his short trimmed brown and gray beard and turned westward toward the more central life conduits of the city in his pocket he had stored an assortment of cards written upon without which he never stirred out of doors each of those cards was good at his own restaurant for its face value some called simply for a bowl of soup or sandwiches and coffee others entitled their bearer to one two three or more days of full meals a few were for single regular meals a very few were in effect meal tickets good for a week of riches and power margrave quigg had none but he had a caliph s heart it may be forgiven him if his head fell short of the measure of harun al rashid s perhaps some of the gold pieces in bagdad had put less warmth and hope into the complainants among the bazaars than had quigg s beef stew among the fishermen and one eyed calenders of manhattan continuing his progress in search of romance to divert him or of distress that he might aid quigg became aware of a fast gathering crowd that whooped and fought and eddied at a corner of broadway and the crosstown street that he was traversing hurrying to the spot he beheld a young man of an exceedingly melancholy and preoccupied demeanor engaged in the pastime of casting silver money from his pockets in the middle of the street with each motion of the generous one s hand the crowd huddled upon the falling largesse with yells of joy traffic was suspended a policman in the centre of the mob stooped often to the ground as he urged the blockaders to move on the margrave saw at a glance that here was food for his hunger after knowledge concerning abnormal working of the human heart he made his way swiftly to the young man s side and took his arm come with me at once he said in the low but commanding voice that his waiters had learned to fear pinched remarked the young man looking up at him with expressionless eyes pinched by a painless dentist take me away flatty and give me gas some lay eggs and some lay none when is a hen still deeply seized by some inward grief but tractable he allowed quigg to lead him away and down the street to a little park there seated on a bench he upon whom a corner of the great caliph s mantle has descended spake with kindness and discretion seeking to know what evil had come upon the other disturbing his soul and driving him to such ill considered and ruinous waste of his substance and stores i was doing the monte cristo act as adapted by pompton n j wasn t i asked the young man you were throwing small coins into the street for the people to scramble after said the margrave that s it you buy all the beer you can hold and then you throw chicken feed to oh curse that word chicken and hens feathers roosters eggs and everything connected with it young sir said the margrave kindly but with dignity though i do not ask your confidence i invite it i know the world and i know humanity man is my study though i do not eye him as the scientist eyes a beetle or as the philanthropist gazes at the objects of his bounty through a veil of theory and ignorance it is my pleasure and distraction to interest myself in the peculiar and complicated misfortunes that life in a great city visits upon my fellow men you may be familiar with the history of that glorious and immortal ruler the caliph harun al rashid whose wise and beneficent excursions among his people in the city of bagdad secured him the privilege of relieving so much of their distress in my humble way i walk in his footsteps i seek for romance and adventure in city streets not in ruined castles or in crumbling palaces to me the greatest marvels of magic are those that take place in men s hearts when acted upon by the furious and diverse forces of a crowded population in your strange behavior this evening i fancy a story lurks i read in your act something deeper than the wanton wastefulness of a spendthrift i observe in your countenance the certain traces of consuming grief or despair i repeat i invite your confidence i am not without some power to alleviate and advise will you not trust me gee how you talk exclaimed the young man a gleam of admiration supplanting for a moment the dull sadness of his eyes you ve got the astor library skinned to a synopsis of preceding chapters i mind that old turk you speak of i read the arabian nights when i was a kid he was a kind of bill devery and charlie schwab rolled into one but say you might wave enchanted dishrags and make copper bottles smoke up coon giants all night without ever touching me my case won t yield to that kind of treatment if i could hear your story said the margrave with his lofty serious smile i ll spiel it in about nine words said the young man with a deep sigh but i don t think you can help me any unless you re a peach at guessing it s back to the bosphorous for you on your magic linoleum the story of the young man and the harness maker s riddle i work in hildebrant s saddle and harness shop down in grant street i ve worked there five years i get a week that s enough to marry on ain t it

ceased the margrave arose and paced to and fro by the park bench for several minutes finally he sat again and said in grave and impressive tones i must confess sir that during the eight years that i have spent in search of adventure and in relieving distress i have never encountered a more interesting or a more perplexing case i fear that i have overlooked hens in my researches and observations as to their habits their times and manner of laying their many varieties and cross breedings their span of life their oh don t make an ibsen drama of it interrupted the young man flippantly riddles especially old hildebrant s riddles don t have to be worked out seriously they are light themes such as sim ford and harry thurston peck like to handle but somehow i can t strike just the answer bill watson may and he may not to morrow will tell well your majesty i m glad anyhow that you butted in and whiled the time away i guess mr al rashid himself would have bounced back if one of his constituents had conducted him up against this riddle i ll say good night peace fo yours and what you may call its of allah the margrave still with a gloomy air held out his hand i cannot exppress my regret he said sadly never before have i found myself unable to assist in some way what kind of a hen lays the longest it is a baffling problem there is a hen i believe called the plymouth rock that cut it out said the young man the caliph trade is a mighty serious one i don t suppose you d even see anything funny in a preacher s defense of john d rockefeller well good night your nibs from habit the margrave began to fumble in his pockets he drew forth a card and handed it to the young man do me the favor to accept this anyhow he said the time may come when it might be of use to you thanks said the young man pocketing it carelessly my name is simmons shame to him who would hint that the reader s interest shall altogether pursue the margrave august michael von paulsen quigg i am indeed astray if my hand fail in keeping the way where my peruser s heart would follow then let us on the morrow peep quickly in at the door of hildebrant harness maker hildebrant s pounds reposed on a bench silverbuckling a raw leather martingale bill watson came in first vell said hildebrant shaking all over with the vile conceit of the joke maker haf you guessed him vat kind of a hen lays der longest er why i think so said bill rubbing a servile chin i think so mr hildebrant the one that lives the longest is that right nein said hildebrant shaking his head violently you haf not guessed der answer bill passed on and donned a bed tick apron and bachelorhood in came the young man of the arabian night s fiasco pale melancholy hopeless vell said hildebrant haf you guessed him vat kind of a hen lays der longest simmons regarded him with dull savagery in his eye should he curse this mountain of pernicious humor curse him and die why should but there was laura dogged speechless he thrust his hands into his coat pockets and stood his hand encountered the strange touch of the margrave s card he drew it out and looked at it as men about to be hanged look at a crawling fly there was written on it in quigg s bold round hand good for one roast chicken to bearer simmons looked up with a flashing eye a dead one said he goot roared hildebrant rocking the table with giant glee dot is right you gome at mine house at o clock to der party compliments of the season there are no more christmas stories to write fiction is exhausted and newspaper items the next best are manufactured by clever young journalists who have married early and have an engagingly pessimistic view of life therefore for seasonable diversion we are reduced to very questionable sources facts and philosophy we will begin with whichever you choose to call it children are pestilential little animals with which we have to cope under a bewildering variety of conditions especially when childish sorrows overwhelm them are we put to our wits end we exhaust our paltry store of consolation and then beat them sobbing to sleep then we grovel in the dust of a million years and ask god why thus we call out of the rat trap as for the children no one understands them except old maids hunchbacks and shepherd dogs now comes the facts in the case of the rag doll the tatterdemalion and the twenty fifth of december on the tenth of that month the child of the millionaire lost her rag doll there were many servants in the millionaire s palace on the hudson and these ransacked the house and grounds but without finding the lost treasure the child was a girl of five and one of those perverse little beasts that often wound the sensibilities of wealthy parents by fixing their affections upon some vulgar inexpensive toy instead of upon diamond studded automobiles and pony phaetons the child grieved sorely and truly a thing inexplicable to the millionaire to whom the rag doll market was about as interesting as bay state gas and to the lady the child s mother who was all form that is nearly all as you shall see the child cried inconsolably and grew hollow eyed knock kneed spindling and corykilverty in many other respects the millionaire smiled and tapped his coffers confidently the pick of the output of the french and german toymakers was rushed by special delivery to the mansion but rachel refused to be comforted she was weeping for her rag child and was for a high protective tariff against all foreign foolishness then doctors with the finest bedside manners and stop watches were called in one by one they chattered futilely about peptomanganate of iron and sea voyages and hypophosphites until their stop watches showed that bill rendered was under the wire for show or place then as men they advised that the rag doll be found as soon as possible and restored to its mourning parent the child sniffed at therapeutics chewed a thumb and wailed for her betsy and all this time cablegrams were coming from santa claus saying that he would soon be here and enjoining us to show a true christian spirit and let up on the pool rooms and tontine policies and platoon systems long enough to give him a welcome everywhere the spirit of christmas was diffusing itself the banks were refusing loans the pawn brokers had doubled their gang of helpers people bumped your shins on the streets with red sleds thomas and jeremiah bubbled before you on the bars while you waited on one foot holly wreaths of hospitality were hung in windows of the stores they who had em were getting their furs you hardly knew which was the best bet in balls three high moth or snow it was no time at which to lose the rag doll or your heart if doctor watson s investigating friend had been called in to solve this mysterious disappearance he might have observed on the millionaire s wall a copy of the vampire that would have quickly suggested by induction a rag and a bone and a hank of hair flip a scotch terrier next to the rag doll in the child s heart frisked through the halls the hank of hair aha x the unfound quantity represented the rag doll but the bone well when dogs find bones they done it were an easy and a fruitful task to examine flip s forefeet look watson earth dried earth between the toes of course the dog but sherlock was not there therefore it devolves but topography and architecture must intervene the millionaire s palace occupied a lordly space in front of it was a lawn close mowed as a south ireland man s face two days after a shave at one side of it and fronting on another street was a pleasuance trimmed to a leaf and the garage and stables the scotch pup had ravished the rag doll from the nursery dragged it to a corner of the lawn dug a hole and buried it after the manner of careless undertakers there you have the mystery solved and no checks to write for the hypodermical wizard of fi pun notes to toss to the sergeant then let s get down to the heart of the thing tiresome readers the christmas heart of the thing fuzzy was drunk not riotously or helplessly or loquaciously as you or i might get but decently appropriately and inoffensively as becomes a gentleman down on his luck fuzzy was a soldier of misfortune the road the haystack the park bench the kitchen door the bitter round of eleemosynary beds with shower bath attachment the petty pickings and ignobly garnered largesse of great cities these formed the chapters of his history fuzzy walked toward the river down the street that bounded one side of the millionaire s house and grounds he saw a leg of betsy the lost rag doll protruding like the clue to a lilliputian murder mystery from its untimely grave in a corner of the fence he dragged forth the maltreated infant tucked it under his arm and went on his way crooning a road song of his brethrren that no doll that has been brought up to the sheltered life should hear well for betsy that she had no ears and well that she had no eyes save unseeing circles of black for the faces of fuzzy and the scotch terrier were those of brothers and the heart of no rag doll could withstand twice to become the prey of such fearsome monsters though you may not know it grogan s saloon stands near the river and near the foot of the street down which fuzzy traveled in grogan s christmas cheer was already rampant fuzzy entered with his doll he fancied that as a mummer at the feast of saturn he might earn a few drops from the wassail cup he set betsy on the bar and addressed her loudly and humorously seasoning his speech with exaggerated compliments and endearments as one entertaining his lady friend the loafers and bibbers around caught the farce of it and roared the bartender gave fuzzy a drink oh many of us carry rag dolls one for the lady suggested fuzzy impudently and tucked another contribution to art beneath his waistcoat he began to see possibilities in betsy his first night had been a success visions of a vaudeville circuit about town dawned upon him in a group near the stove sat pigeon mccarthy black riley and one ear mike well and unfavorably known in the tough shoestring district that blackened the left bank of the river they passed a newspaper back and forth among themselves the item that each solid and blunt forefinger pointed out was an advertisement headed one hundred dollars reward to earn it one must return the rag doll lost strayed or stolen from the millionaire s mansion it seemed that grief still ravaged unchecked in the bosom of the too faithful child flip the terrier capered and shook his absurd whisker before her powerless to distract she wailed for her betsy in the faces of walking talking mama ing and eye closing french mabelles and violettes the advertisement was a last resort black riley came from behind the stove and approached fuzzy in his one sided parabolic way the christmas mummer flushed with success had tucked betsy under his arm and was about to depart to the filling of impromptu dates elsewhere say bo said black riley to him where did you cop out dat doll this doll asked fuzzy touching betsy with his forefinger to be sure that she was the one referred to his doll was presented to me by the emperor of beloochistan i have seven hundred others in my country home in newport this doll cheese the funny business said riley you swiped it or picked it up at de house on de hill where but never mind dat you want to take fifty cents for de rags and take it quick me brother s kid at home might be wantin to play wid it hey what he produced the coin fuzzy laughed a gurgling insolent alcoholic laugh in his face go to the office of sarah bernhardt s manager and propose to him that she be released from a night s performance to entertain the tackytown lyceum and literary coterie you will hear the duplicate of fuzzy s laugh black riley gauged fuzzy quickly with his blueberry eye as a wrestler does his hand was itching to play the roman and wrest the rag sabine from the extemporaneous merry andrew who was entertaining an angel unaware but he refrained fuzzy was fat and solid and big three inches of well nourished corporeity defended from the winter winds by dingy linen intervened between his vest and trousers countless small circular wrinkles running around his coat sleeves and knees guaranteed the quality of his bone and muscle his small blue eyes bathed in the moisture of altruism and wooziness looked upon you kindly yet without abashment he was whiskerly whiskyly fleshily formidable so black riley temporized wot ll you take for it den he asked money said fuzzy with husky firmness cannot buy her he was intoxicated with the artist s first sweet cup of attainment to set a faded blue earth stained rag doll on a bar to hold mimic converse with it and to find his heart leaping with the sense of plaudits earned and his throat scorching with free libations poured in his honor could base coin buy him from such achievements you will perceive that fuzzy had the temperament fuzzy walked out with the gait of a trained sea lion in search of other caf es to conquer though the dusk of twilight was hardly yet apparent lights were beginning to spangle the city like pop corn bursting in a deep skillet christmas eve impatiently expected was peeping over the brink of the hour millions had prepared for its celebration towns would be painted red you yourself have heard the horns and dodged the capers of the saturnalians pigeon mccarthy black riley and one ear mike held a hasty converse outside grogan s they were narrow chested pallid striplings not fighters in the open but more dangerous in their ways of warfare than the most terrible of turks fuzzy in a pitched battle could have eaten the three of them in a go as you please encounter he was already doomed they overtook him just as he and betsy were entering costigan s casino they deflected him and shoved the newspaper under his nose fuzzy could read and more boys said he you are certainly damn true friends give me a week to think it over the soul of a real artist is quenched with difficulty the boys carefully pointed out to him that advertisements were soulless and that the deficiencies of the day might not be supplied by the morrow a cool hundred said fuzzy thoughtfully and mushily booys said he you are true friends i ll go up and claim the reward the show business is not what it used to be night was falling more surely the three tagged at his sides to the foot of the rise on which stood the millionaire s house there fuzzy turned upon them acrimoniously you are a pack of putty faced beagle hounds he roared go away they went away a little way in pigeon mccarthy s pocket was a section of one inch gas pipe eight inches long in one end of it and in the middle of it was a lead plug one half of it was packed tight with solder black riley carried a slung shot being a conventional thug one ear mike relied upon a pair of brass knucks an heirloom in the family why fetch and carry said black riley when some one will do it for ye let him bring it out to us hey what we can chuck him in the river said pigeon mccarthy with a stone tied to his feet youse guys make me tired said one ear mike sadly ain t progress ever appealed to none of yez sprinkle a little gasoline on im and drop im on the drive well fuzzy entered the millionaire s gate and zigzagged toward the softly glowing entrance of the mansion the three goblins came up to the gate and lingered one on each side of it one beyond the roadway they fingered their cold metal and leather confident fuzzy rang the door bell smiling foolishly and dreamily an atavistic instrinct prompted him to reach for the button of his right glove but he wore no gloves so his left hand dropped embarrassed the particular menial whose duty it was to open doors to silks and laces shied at first sight of fuzzy but a second glance took in his passport his card of admission his surety of welcome the lost rag doll of the daughter of the house dangling under his arm fuzzy was admitted into a great hall dim with the glow from unseen lights the hireling went away and returned with a maid and the child the doll was restored to the mourning one she clasped her lost darling to her breast and then with the inordinate selfishness and candor of childhood stamped her foot and whined hatred and fear of the odious being who had rescued her from the depths of sorrow and despair fuzzy wriggled himself into an ingratiatory attitude and essayed the idiotic smile and blattering small talk that is supposed to charm the budding intellect of the young the child bawled and was dragged away hugging her betsy close there came the secretary pale poised polished gliding in pumps and worshipping pomp and ceremony he counted out into fuzzy s hand ten ten dollar bills then dropped his eye upon the door transferred it to james its custodian indicated the obnoxious earner of the reward with the other and allowed his pumps to waft him away to secretarial regions james gathered fuzzy with his own commanding optic and swept him as far as the front door when the money touched fuzzy s dingy palm his first instinct was to take to his heels but a second thought restrained him from that blunder of etiquette it was his it had been given him it and oh what an elysium it opened to the gaze of his mind s eye he had tumbled to the foot of the ladder he was hungry homeless friendless ragged cold drifting and he held in his hand the key to a paradise of the mud honey that he craved the fairy doll had waved a wand with her rag stuffed hand and now wherever he might go the enchanted palaces with shining foot rests and magic red fluids in gleaming glassware would be open to him he followed james to the door he paused there as the flunky drew open the great mahogany portal for him to pass into the vestibule beyond the wrought iron gates in the dark highway black riley and his two pals casually strolled fingering under their coats the inevitably fatal weapons that were to make the reward of the rag doll theirs fuzzy stopped at the millionaire s door and bethought himself like little sprigs of mistletoe on a dead tree certain living green thoughts and memories began to decorate his confused mind he was quite drunk mind you and the present was beginning to fade those wreaths aand festoons of holly with their scarlet berries making the great hall gay where had he seen such things before somewhere he had known polished floors and odors of fresh flowers in winter and and some one was singing a song in the house that he thought he had heard before some one singing and playing a harp of course it was christmas fuzzy though he must have been pretty drunk to have overlooked that and then he went out of the present and there came back to him out of some impossible vanished and irrevocable past a little pure white transient forgotten ghost the spirit of nobless oblige upon a gentleman certain things devolve james opened the outer door a stream of light went down the graveled walk to the iron gate black riley mccarthy and one ear mike saw and carelessly drew their sinister cordon closer about the gate with a more imperious gesture than james s master had ever used or could ever use fuzzy compelled the menial to close the door upon a gentleman certain things devolve especially at the christmas season it is cust customary he said to james the flustered when a gentleman calls on christmas eve to pass the compliments of the season with the lady of the house you und stand i shall not move shtep till i pass compl ments season with lady the house und stand there was an argument james lost fuzzy raised his voice and sent it through the house unpleasantly i did not say he was a gentleman he was simply a tramp being visited by a ghost a sterling silver bell rang james went back to answer it leaving fuzzy in the hall james explained somewhere to some one then he came and conducted fuzzy into the library the lady entered a moment later she was more beautiful and holy than any picture that fuzzy had seen she smiled and said something about a doll fuzzy didn t understand that he remembered nothing about a doll a footman brought in two small glasses of sparkling wine on a stamped sterling silver waiter the lady took one the other was handed to fuzzy as his fingers closed on the slender glass stem his disabilities dropped from him for one brief moment he straightened himself and time so disobliging to most of us turned backward to accomodate fuzzy forgotten christmas ghosts whiter than the false beards of the most opulent kris kringle were rising in the fumes of grogan s whisky what had the millionaire s mansion to do with a long wainscoted virginia hall where the riders were grouped around a silver punch bowl drinking the ancient toast of the house and why should the patter of the cab horses hoofs on the frozen street be in any wise related to the sound of the saddled hunters stamping under the shelter of the west veranda and what had fuzzy to do with any of it the lady looking at him over her glass let her condescending smile fade away like a false dawn her eyes turned serious she saw something beneath the rags and scotch terrier whiskers that she did not understand but it did not matter fuzzy lifted his glass and smiled vacantly p pardon lady he said but couldn t leave without exchangin comp ments sheason with lady th house gainst princ ples gen leman do sho and then he began the ancient salutation that was a tradition in the house when men wore lace ruffles and powder the blessings of another year fuzzy s memory failed him the lady prompted be upon this hearth the guest stammered fuzzy and upon her who continued the lady with a leading smile oh cut it out said fuzzy ill manneredly i can t remember drink hearty fuzzy had shot his arrow they drank the lady smiled again the smile of her caste james enveloped and re conducted him toward the front door the harp music still softly drifted through the house outside black riley breathed on his cold hands and hugged the gate i wonder said the lady to herself musing who but there were so many who came i wonder whether memory is a curse or a blessing to them after they have fallen so low fuzzy and his escort were nearly at the door the lady called james james stalked back obsequiously leaving fuzzy waiting unsteadily with his brief spark of the divine fire gone outside black riley stamped his cold feet and got a firmer grip on his section of gas pipe you will conduct this gentleman said the lady downstairs then tell louis to get out the mercedes and take him to whatever place he wishes to go a night in new arabia the great city of bagdad on the subway is caliph ridden its palaces bazaars khans and byways are thronged with al rashids in divers disguises seeking diversion and victims for their unbridled generosity you can scarcely find a poor beggar whom they are willing to let enjoy his spoils unsuccored nor a wrecked unfortunate upon whom they will not reshower the means of fresh misfortune you will hardly find anywhere a hungry one who has not had the opportunity to tighten his belt in gift libraries nor a poor pundit who has not blushed at the holiday basket of celery crowned turkey forced resoundingly through his door by the eleemosynary press so then fearfully through the harun haunted streets creep the one eyed calenders the little hunchback and the barber s sixth brother hoping to escape the ministrations of the roving horde of caliphoid sultans entertainment for many arabian nights might be had from the histories of those who have escaped the largesse of the army of commanders of the faithful until dawn you might sit on the enchanted rug and listen to such stories as are told of the powerful genie roc ef el er who sent the forty thieves to soak up the oil plant of ali baba of the good caliph kar neg ghe who gave away palaces of the seven voyages of sailbad the sinner who frequented wooden excursion steamers among the islands of the fisherman and the bottle of the barmecides boarding house of aladdin s rise to wealth by means of his wonderful gasmeter but now there being ten sultans to one sheherazade she is held too valuable to be in fear of the bowstring in consequence the art of narrative languishes and as the lesser caliphs are hunting the happy poor and the resigned unfortunate from cover to cover in order to heap upon them strange mercies and mysterious benefits too often comes the report from arabian headquarters that the captive refused to talk this reticence then in the actors who perform the sad comedies of their philanthropy scourged world must in a degree account for the shortcomings of this painfully gleaned tale which shall be called the story of the caliph who alleviated his conscience old jacob spraggins mixed for himself some scotch and lithia water at his oak sideboard inspiration must have resulted from its imbibition for immediately afterward he struck the quartered oak soundly with his fist and shouted to the empty dining room by the coke ovens of hell it must be that ten thousand dollars if i can get that squared it ll do the trick thus by the commonest artifice of the trade having gained your interest the action of the story will now be suspended leaving you grumpily to consider a sort of dull biography beginning fifteen years before when old jacob was young jacob he was a breaker boy in a pennsylvania coal mine i don t know what a breaker boy is but his occupation seems to be standing by a coal dump with a wan look and a dinner pail to have his picture taken for magazine articles anyhow jacob was one but instead of dying of overwork at nine and leaving his helpless parents and brothers at the mercy of the union strikers reserve fund he hitched up his galluses put a dollar or two in a side proposition now and then and at forty five was worth there now it s over hardly had time to yawn did you i ve seen biographies that but let us dissemble i want you to consider jacob spraggins esq after he had arrived at the seventh stage of his career the stages meant are first humble origin second deserved promotion third stockholder fourth capitalist fifth trust magnate sixth rich malefactor seventh caliph eighth x the eighth stage shall be left to the higher mathematics at fifty five jacob retired from active business the income of a czar was still rolling in on him from coal iron real estate oil railroads manufactories and corporations but none of it touched jacob s hands in a raw state it was a sterilized increment carefully cleaned and dusted and fumigated until it arrived at its ultimate stage of untainted spotless checks in the white fingers of his private secretary jacob built a three million dollar palace on a corner lot fronting on nabob avenue city of new bagdad and began to feel the mantle of the late h a rashid descending upon him eventually jacob slipped the mantle under his collar tied it in a neat four in hand and became a licensed harrier of our mesopotamian proletariat when a man s income becomes so large that the butcher actually sends him the kind of steak he orders he begins to think about his soul s salvation now the various stages or classes of rich men must not be forgotten the capitalist can tell you to a dollar the amount of his wealth the trust magnate estimates it the rich malefactor hands you a cigar and denies that he has bought the p d q the caliph merely smiles and talks about hammerstein and the musical lasses there is a record of tremendous altercation at breakfast in a where to dine well tavern between a magnate and his wife the rift within the loot being that the wife calculated their fortune at a figure higher than did her future divorc oh well i myself heard a similar quarrel between a man and his wife because he found fifty cents less in his pockets than he thought he had after all we are all human count tolstoi r fitzsimmons peter pan and the rest of us don t lose heart because the story seems to be degenerating into a sort of moral essay for intellectual readers there will be dialogue and stage business pretty soon when jacob first began to compare the eyes of needles with the camels in the zoo he decided upon organized charity he had his secretary send a check for one million to the universal benevolent association of the globe you may have looked down through a grating in front of a decayed warehouse for a nickel that you had dropped through but that is neither here nor there the association acknowledged receipt of his favor of the th ult with enclosure as stated separated by a double line but still mighty close to the matter under the caption of oddities of the day s news in an evening paper jacob spraggins read that one jasper spargyous had donated to the u b a of g a camel may have a stomach for each day in the week but i dare not venture to accord him whiskers for fear of the great displeasure at washington but if he have whiskers surely not one of them will seem to have been inserted in the eye of a needle by that effort of that rich man to enter the k of h the right is reserved to reject any and all bids signed s peter secretary and gatekeeper next jacob selected the best endowed college he could scare up and presented it with a laboratory the college did not maintain a scientific course but it accepted the money and built an elaborate lavatory instead which was no diversion of funds so far as jacob ever discovered the faculty met and invited jacob to come over and take his a b c degree before sending the invitation they smiled cut out the c added the proper punctuation marks and all was well while walking on the campus before being capped and gowned jacob saw two professors strolling nearby their voices long adapted to indoor acoustics undesignedly reached his ear there goes the latest chevalier d industrie said one of them to buy a sleeping powder from us he gets his degree to morrow in foro conscientai said the other let s eave arf a brick at im jacob ignored the latin but the brick pleasantry was not too hard for him there was no mandragora in the honorary draught of learning that he had bought that was before the passage of the pure food and drugs act jacob wearied of philanthropy on a large scale if i could see folks made happier he said to himself if i could see em myself and hear em express their gratitude for what i done for em it would make me feel better this donatin funds to institutions and societies is about as satisfactory as dropping money into a broken slot machine so jacob followed his nose which led him through unswept streets to the homes of the poorest the very thing said jacob i will charter two river steamboats pack them full of these unfortunate children and say ten thousand dolls and drums and a thousand freezers of ice cream and give them a delightful outing up the sound the sea breezes on that trip ought to blow the taint off some of this money that keeps coming in faster than i can work it off my mind jacob must have leaked some of his benevolent intentions for an immense person with a bald face and a mouth that looked as if it ought to have a drop letters here sign over it hooked a finger around him and set him in a space between a barber s pole and a stack of ash cans words came out of the post office slit smooth husky words with gloves on em but sounding as if they might turn to bare knuckles any moment say sport do you know where you are at well dis is mike o grady s district you re buttin into see mike s got de stomach ache privilege for every kid in dis neighborhood see and if dere s any picnics or red balloons to be dealt out here mike s money pays for em see don t you butt in or something ll be handed to you youse d settlers and reformers with your social ologies and your millionaire detectives have got dis district in a hell of a fix anyhow with your college students and professors rough housing de soda water stands and dem rubber neck coaches fillin de streets de folks down here are fraid to go out of de houses now you leave em to mike dey belongs to him and he knows how to handle em keep on your own side of de town are you some wiser now uncle or do you want to scrap wit mike o grady for de santa claus belt in dis district clearly that spot in the moral vineyard was preempted so caliph spraggins menaced no more the people in the bazaars of the east side to keep down his growing surplus he doubled his donations to organized charity presented the y m c a of his native town with a collection of butterflies and sent a check to the famine sufferers in china big enough to buy new emerald eyes and diamond filled teeth for all their gods but none of these charitable acts seemed to bring peace to the caliph s heart he tried to get a personal note into his benefactions by tipping bellboys and waiters and bills he got well snickered at and derided for that by the minions who accept with respect gratuities commensurate to the service performed he sought out an ambitious and talented but poor young woman and bought for her the star part in a new comedy he might have gotten rid of more of his cumbersome money in this philanthropy if he had not neglected to write letters to her but she lost the suit for lack of evidence while his capital still kept piling up and his optikos needleorum camelibus or rich man s disease was unrelieved in caliph spraggins s home lived his sister henrietta who used to cook for the coal miners in a twenty five cent eating house in coketown pa and who now would have offered john mitchell only two fingers of her hand to shake and his daughter celia nineteen back from boarding school and from being polished off by private instructors in the restaurant languages and those etudes and things celia is the heroine lest the artist s delineation of her charms on this very page humbug your fancy take from me her authorized description she was a nice looking awkward loud rather bashful brown haired girl with a sallow complexion bright eyes and a perpetual smile she had a wholesome spraggins inherited love for plain food loose clothing and the society of the lower classes she had too much health and youth to feel the burden of wealth she had a wide mouth that kept the peppermint pepsin tablets rattling like hail from the slot machine wherever she went and she could whistle hornpipes keep this picture in mind and let the artist do his worst celia looked out of her window one day and gave her heart to the grocer s young man the receiver thereof was at that moment engaged in conceding immortality to his horse and calling down upon him the ultimate fate of the wicked so he did not notice the transfer a horse should stand still when you are lifting a crate of strictly new laid eggs out of the wagon young lady reader you would have liked that grocer s young man yourself but you wouldn t have given him your heart because you are saving it for a riding master or a shoe manufacturer with a torpid liver or something quiet but rich in gray tweeds at palm beach oh i know about it so i am glad the grocer s young man was for celia and not for you the grocer s young man was slim and straight and as confident and easy in his movements as the man in the back of the magazines who wears the new frictionless roller suspenders he wore a gray bicycle cap on the back of his head and his hair was straw colored and curly and his sunburned face looked like one that smiled a good deal when he was not preaching the doctrine of everlasting punishment to delivery wagon horses he slung imported a fancy groceries about as though they were only the stuff he delivered at boarding houses and when he picked up his whip your mind instantly recalled mr tacktt and his air with the buttonless foils tradesmen delivered their goods at a side gate at the rear of the house the grocer s wagon came about ten in the morning for three days celia watched the driver when he came finding something new each time to admire in the lofty and almost contemptuous way he had of tossing around the choicest gifts of pomona ceres and the canning factories then she consulted annette to be explicit annette mccorkle the second housemaid who deserves a paragraph herself annette fletcherized large numbers of romantic novels which she obtained at a free public library branch donated by one of the biggest caliphs in the business she was celia s sidekicker and chum though aunt henrietta didn t know it you may hazard a bean or two oh canary bird seed exclaimed annette ain t it a corkin situation you a heiress and fallin in love with him on sight he s a sweet boy too and above his business but he ain t susceptible like the common run of grocer s assistants he never pays no attention to me he will to me said celia riches began annette unsheathing the not unjustifiable feminine sting oh you re not so beautiful said celia with her wide disarming smile neither am i but he sha n t know that there s any money mixed up with my looks such as they are that s fair now i want you to lend me one of your caps and an apron annette oh marshmallows cried annette i see ain t it lovely it s just like lurline the left handed or a buttonhole maker s wrongs i ll bet he ll turn out to be a count there was a long hallway or passageway as they call it in the land of the colonels with one side latticed running along the rear of the house the grocer s young man went through this to deliver his goods one morning he passed a girl in there with shining eyes sallow complexion and wide smiling mouth wearing a maid s cap and apron but as he was cumbered with a basket of early drumhead lettuce and trophy tomatoes and three bunches of asparagus and six bottles of the most expensive queen olives he saw no more than that she was one of the maids but on his way out he came up behind her and she was whistling fisher s hornpipe so loudly and clearly that all the piccolos in the world should have disjointed themselves and crept into their cases for shame the grocer s young man stopped and pushed back his cap until it hung on his collar button behind that s out o sight kid said he my name is celia if you please said the whistler dazzling him with a three inch smile that s all right i m thomas mcleod what part of the house do you work in i m the the second parlor maid do you know the falling waters no said celia we don t know anybody we got rich too quick that is mr spraggins did i ll make you acquainted said thomas mcleod it s a strathspey the first cousin to a hornpipe if celia s whistling put the piccolos out of commission thomas mcleod s surely made the biggest flutes hunt their holes he could actually whistle bass when he stopped celia was ready to jump into his delivery wagon and ride with him clear to the end of the pier and on to the ferry boat of the charon line i ll be around to morrow at said thomas with some spinach and a case of carbonic i ll practice that what you may call it said celia i can whistle a fine second the processes of courtship are personal and do not belong to general literature they should be chronicled in detail only in advertisements of iron tonics and in the secret by laws of the woman s auxiliary of the ancient order of the rat trap but genteel writing may contain a description of certain stages of its progress without intruding upon the province of the x ray or of park policemen a day came when thomas mcleod and celia lingered at the end of the latticed passage sixteen a week isn t much said thomas letting his cap rest on his shoulder blades celia looked through the lattice work and whistled a dead march shopping with aunt henrietta the day before she had paid that much for a dozen handkerchiefs maybe i ll get a raise next month said thomas i ll be around to morrow at the same time with a bag of flour and the laundry soap all right said celia annette s married cousin pays only a month for a flat in the bronx never for a moment did she count on the spraggins money she knew aunt henrietta s invincible pride of caste and pa s mightiness as a colossus of cash and she understood that if she chose thomas she and her grocer s young man might go whistle for a living another day came thomas violating the dignity of nabob avenue with the devil s dream whistled keenly between his teeth raised to eighteen a week yesterday he said been pricing flats around morningside you want to start untying those apron strings and unpinning that cap old girl oh tommy said celia with her broadest smile won t that be enough i got betty to show me how to make a cottage pudding i guess we could call it a flat pudding if we wanted to and tell no lie said thomas and i can sweep and polish and dust of course a parlor maid learns that and we cold whistle duets of evenings the old man said he d raise me to twenty at christmas if bryan couldn t think of any harder name to call a republican than a postponer said the grocer s young man i can sew said celia and i know that you must make the gas company s man show his badge when he comes to look at the meter and i know how to put up quince jam and window curtains bully you re all right cele yes i believe we can pull it off on eighteen as he was jumping into the wagon the second parlor maid braved discovery by running swiftly to the gate and oh tommy i forgot she called softly i believe i could make your neckties forget it said thomas decisively and another thing she continued sliced cucumbers at night will drive away cockroaches and sleep too you bet said mr mcleod yes i believe if i have a delivery to make on the west side this afternoon i ll look in at a furniture store i know over there it was just as the wagon dashed away that old jacob spraggins struck the sideboard with his fist and made the mysterious remark about ten thousand dollars that you perhaps remember which justifies the reflection that some stories as well as life and puppies thrown into wells move around in circles painfully but briefly we must shed light on jacob s words the foundation of his fortune was made when he was twenty a poor coal digger ever hear of a rich one had saved a dollar or two and bought a small tract of land on a hillside on which he tried to raise corn not a nubbin jacob whose nose was a divining rod told him there was a vein of coal beneath he bought the land from the miner for and sold it a month afterward for luckily the miner had enough left of his sale money to drink himself into a black coat opening in the back as soon as he heard the news and so for forty years afterward we find jacob illuminated with the sudden thought that if he could make restitution of this sum of money to the heirs or assigns of the unlucky miner respite and nepenthe might be his and now must come swift action for we have here some four thousand words and not a tear shed and never a pistol joke safe nor bottle cracked old jacob hired a dozen private detectives to find the heirs if any existed of the old miner hugh mcleod get the point of course i know as well as you do that thomas is going to be the heir i might have concealed the name but why always hold back you mystery till the end i say let it come near the middle so people can stop reading there if they want to after the detectives had trailed false clues about three thousand dollars i mean miles they cornered thomas at the grocery and got his confession that hugh mcleod had been his grandfather and that there were no other heirs they arranged a meeting for him and old jacob one morning in one of their offices jacob liked the young man very much he liked the way he looked straight at him when he talked and the way he threw his bicycle cap over the top of a rose colored vase on the centre table there was a slight flaw in jacob s system of restitution he did not consider that the act to be perfect should include confession so he represented himself to be the agent of the purchaser of the land who had sent him to refund the sale price for the ease of his conscience well sir said thomas this sounds to me like an illustrated post card from south boston with we re having a good time here written on it i don t know the game is this ten thousand dollars money or do i have to save so many coupons to get it old jacob counted out to him twenty five hundred dollar bills that was better he thought than a check thomas put them thoughtfully into his pocket grandfather s best thanks he said to the party who sends it jacob talked on asking him about his work how he spent his leisure time and what his ambitions were the more he saw and heard of thomas the better he liked him he had not met many young men in bagdad so frank and wholesome i would like to have you visit my house he said i might help you in investing or laying out your money i am a very wealthy man i have a daughter about grown and i would like for you to know her there are not many young men i would care to have call on her i m obliged said thomas i m not much at making calls it s generally the side entrance for mine and besides i m engaged to a girl that has the delaware peach crop killed in the blossom she s a parlor maid in a house where i deliver goods she won t be working there much longer though say don t forget to give your friend my grandfather s best regards you ll excuse me now my wagon s outside with a lot of green stuff that s got to be delivered see you again sir at eleven thomas delivered some bunches of parsley and lettuce at the spraggins mansion thomas was only twenty two so as he came back he took out the handful of five hundred dollar bills and waved them carelessly annette took a pair of eyes as big as creamed onion to the cook i told you he was a count she said after relating he never would carry on with me but you say he showed money said the cook hundreds of thousands said annette carried around loose in his pockets and he never would look at me it was paid to me to day thomas was explaining to celia outside it came from my grandfather s estate say cele what s the use of waiting now i m going to quit the job to night why can t we get married next week tommy said celia i m no parlor maid i ve been fooling you i m miss spraggins celia spraggins the newspapers say i ll be worth forty million dollars some day thomas pulled his cap down straight on his head for the first time since we have known him i suppose then said he i suppose then you ll not be marrying me next week but you can whistle no said celia i ll not be marrying you next week my father would never let me marry a grocer s clerk but i ll marry you to night tommy if you say so old jacob spraggins came home at p m in his motor car the make of it you will have to surmise sorrowfully i am giving you unsubsidized fiction had it been a street car i could have told you its voltage and the number of wheels it had jacob called for his daughter he had bought a ruby necklace for her and wanted to hear her say what a kind thoughtful dear old dad he was there was a brief search in the house for her and then came annette glowing with the pure flame of truth and loyalty well mixed with envy and histrionics oh sir said she wondering if she should kneel miss celia s just this minute running away out of the side gate with a young man to be married i couldn t stop her sir they went in a cab what young man roared old jacob a millionaire if you please sir a rich nobleman in disguise he carries his money with him and the red peppers and the onions was only to blind us sir he never did seem to take to me jacob rushed out in time to catch his car the chauffeur had been delayed by trying to light a cigarette in the wind here gaston or mike or whatever you call yourself scoot around the corner quicker than blazes and see if you can see a cab if you do run it down there was a cab in sight a block away gaston or mike with his eyes half shut and his mind on his cigarette picked up the trail neatly crowded the cab to the curb and pocketed it what t ell you doin yelled the cabman pa shrieked celia grandfather s remorseful friend s agent said thomas wonder what s on his conscience now a thousand thunders said gaston or mike i have no other match young man said old jacob severely how about that parlor maid you were engaged to a couple of years afterward old jacob went into the office of his private secretary the amalgamated missionary society solicits a contribution of toward the conversion of the koreans said the secretary pass em up said jacob the university of plumville writes that its yearly endowment fund of that you bestowed upon it is past due tell em it s been cut out the scientific society of clam cove long island asks for to buy alcohol to preserve specimens waste basket the society for providing healthful recreation for working girls wants from you to lay out a golf course tell em to see an undertaker cut em all out went on jacob i ve quit being a good thing i need every dollar i can scrape or save i want you to write to the directors of every company that i m interested in and recommend a per cent cut in salaries and say i noticed half a cake of soap lying in a corner of the hall as i came in i want you to speak to the scrubwoman about waste i ve got no money to throw away and say we ve got vinegar pretty well in hand haven t we the globe spice seasons company said secretary controls the market at present raise vinegar two cents a gallon notify all our branches suddenly jacob spraggin s plump red face relaxed into a pulpy grin he walked over to the secretary s desk and showed a small red mark on his thick forefinger bit it he said darned if he didn t and he ain t had the tooth three weeks jaky mcleod my celia s kid he ll be worth a hundred millions by the time he s twenty one if i can pile it up for him as he was leaving old jacob turned at the door and said better make that vinegar raise three cents instead of two i ll be back in an hour and sign the letters the true history of the caliph harun al rashid relates that toward the end of his reign he wearied of philanthropy and caused to be beheaded all his former favorites and companions of his arabian nights rambles happy are we in these days of enlightenment when the only death warrant the caliphs can serve on us is in the form of a tradesman s bill the girl and the habit habit a tendency or aptitude acquired by custom or frequent repitition the critics have assailed every source of inspiration save one to that one we are driven for our moral theme when we levied upon the masters of old they gleefully dug up the parallels to our columns when we strove to set forth real life they reproached us for trying to imitate henry george george washington washington irving and irving bacheller we wrote of the west and the east and they accused us of both jesse and henry james we wrote from our heart and they said something about a disordered liver we took a text from

unassailable vade mecum the unabridged dictionary miss merriam was cashier at hinkle s hinkle s is one of the big downtown restaurants it is in what the papers call the financial district each day from o clock to hinkle s was full of hungry customers messenger boys stenographers brokers owners of mining stock promoters inventors with patents pending and also people with money the cashiership at hinkle s was no sinecure hinkle egged and toasted and griddle caked and coffeed a good many customers and he lunched as good a word as dined many more it might be said that hinkle s breakfast crowd was a contingent but his luncheon patronage amounted to a horde miss merriam sat on a stool at a desk inclosed on three sides by a strong high fencing of woven brass wire through an arched opening at the bottom you thrust your waiter s check and the money while your heart went pit pat for miss merriam was lovely and capable she could take cents out of a bill and refuse an offer of marriage before you could next lost your chance please don t shove she could keep cool and collected while she collected your check give you the correct change win your heart indicate the toothpick stand and rate you to a quarter of a cent better than bradstreet could to a thousand in less time than it takes to pepper an egg with one of hinkle s casters there is an old and dignified allusion to the fierce light that beats upon a throne the light that beats upon the young lady cashier s cage is also something fierce the other fellow is responsible for the slang every male patron of hinkle s from a d t boys up to the curbstone brokers adored miss merriam when they paid their checks they wooed her with every wile known to cupid s art between the meshes of the brass railing went smiles winks compliments tender vows invitations to dinner sighs languishing looks and merry banter that was wafted pointedly back by the gifted miss merriam there is no coign of vantage more effective than the position of young lady cashier she sits there easily queen of the court of commerce she is duchess of dollars and devoirs countess of compliment and coin leading lady of love and luncheon you take from her a smile and a canadian dime and you go your way uncomplaining you count the cheery word or two that she tosses you as misers count their treasures and you pocket the change for a five uncomputed perhaps the brass bound inaccessibility multiplies her charms anyhow she is a shirt waisted angel immaculate trim manicured seductive bright eyed ready alert psyche circe and ate in one separating you from your circulating medium after your sirloin medium the young men who broke bread at hinkle s never settled with the cashier without an exchange of badinage and open compliment many of them went to greater lengths and dropped promissory hints of theatre tickets and chocolate the older spoke plainly of orange blossoms generally withering the tentative petals by after allusions to harlem flats one broker who had been squeezed by copper proposed to miss merriam more regularly than he ate during a brisk luncheon hour miss merriam s conversation while she took money for checks would run something

a pharisee a man and a policeman who were first on the spot lifter banker mcramsey and carried him into hinkle s restaurant when the aged but indestructible banker opened his eyes he saw a beautikful vision bending over him with a pitiful tender smile bathing his forehead with beef tea and chafing his hands with something frapp e out of a chafing dish mr mcramsey sighed lost a vest button gazed with deep gratitude upon his fair preserveress and then recovered consciousness to the seaside library all who are anticipating a romance banker mcramsey had an aged and respected wife and his sentiments toward miss merriam were fatherly he talked to her for half an hour with interest not the kind that went with his talks during business hours the next day he brought mrs mcramsey down to see her the old couple were childless they had only a married daughter living in brooklyn to make a short story shorter the beautiful cashier won the hearts of the good old couple they came to hinkle s again and again they invited her to their old fashioned but splendid home in one of the east seventies miss merriam s winning loveliness her sweet frankness and impulsive heart took them by storm they said a hundred times that miss merriam reminded them so much of their lost daughter the brooklyn matron n ee ramsey had the figure of buddha and a face like the ideal of an art photographer miss merriam was a combination of curves smiles rose leaves pearls satin and hair tonic posters enough of the fatuity of parents a month after the worthy couple became acquainted with miss merriam she stood before hinkle one afternoon and resigned her cashiership they re going to adopt me she told the bereft restaurateur they re funny old people but regular dears and the swell home they have got say hinkle there isn t any use of talking i m on the a la carte to wear brown duds and goggles in a whiz wagon or marry a duke at least still i somehow hate to break out of the old cage i ve been cashiering so long i feel funny doing anything else i ll miss joshing the fellows awfully when they line up to pay for the buckwheats and but i can t let this chance slide and they re awfully good hinkle i know i ll have a swell time you owe me nine sixty two and a half for the week cut out the half if it hurts you hinkle and they did miss merriam became miss rosa mcramsey and she graced the transition beauty is only skin deep but the nerves lie very near to the skin nerve but just here will you oblige by perusing again the quotation with which this story begins the mcramseys poured out money like domestic champagne to polish their adopted one milliners dancing masters and private tutors got it miss er mcramsey was grateful loving and tried to forget hinkle s to give ample credit to the adaptability of the american girl hinkle s did fade from her memory and speech most of the time not every one will remember when the earl of hitesbury came to east seventy street america he was only a fair to medium earl without debts and he created little excitement but you will surely remember the evening when the daughters of benevolence haled their bazaar in the w f a a hotel for you were there and you wrote a note to fannie on the hotel paper and mailed it just to show her that you did not very well that was the evening the baby was sick of course at the bazaar the mcramseys were prominent miss mer er mcramsey was exquisitely beautiful the earl of hitesbury had been very attentive to her since he dropped in to have a look at america at the charity bazaar the affair was supposed to be going to be pulled off to a finish an earl is as good as a duke better his standing may be lower but his outstanding accounts are also lower our ex young lady cashier was assigned to a booth she was expected to sell worthless articles to nobs and snobs at exorbitant prices the proceeds of the bazaar were to be used for giving the poor children of the slums a christmas din say did you ever wonder where they get the other miss mcramsey beautiful palpitating excited charming radiant fluttered about in her booth an imitation brass network with a little arched opening fenced her in along came the earl assured delicate accurate admiring admiring greatly and faced the open wicket you look chawming you know pon my word you do my deah he said beguilingly cut that joshing out she said coolly and briskly who do you think you are talking to your check please oh lordy patrons of the bazaar became aware of a commotion and pressed around a certain booth the earl of hitesbury stood near by pulling a pale blond and puzzled whisker miss mcramsey has fainted some one explained proof of the pudding spring winked a vitreous optic at editor westbrook of the minerva magazine and deflected him from his course he had lunched in his favorite corner of a broadway hotel and was returning to his office when his feet became entangled in the lure of the vernal coquette which is by way of saying that he turned eastward in twenty sixth street safely forded the spring freshet of vehicles in fifth avenue and meandered along the walks of budding madison square the lenient air and the settings of the little park almost formed a pastoral the color motif was green the presiding shade at the creation of man and vegetation the callow grass between the walks was the color of verdigris a poisonous green reminiscent of the horde of derelict humans that had breathed upon the soil during the summer and autumn the bursting tree buds looked strangely familiar to those who had botanized among the garnishings of the fish course of a forty cent dinner the sky above was of that pale aquamarine tint that ballroom poets rhyme with true and sue and coo the one natural and frank color visible was the ostensible green of the newly painted benches a shade between the color of a pickled cucumber and that of a last year s fast black cravenette raincoat but to the city bred eye of editor westbrook the landscape appeared a masterpiece and now whether you are of those who rush in or of the gentle concourse that fears to tread you must follow in a brief invasion of the editor s mind editor westbrook s spirit was contented and serene the april number of the minerva had sold its entire edition before the tenth day of the month a newsdealer in keokuk had written that he could have sold fifty copies more if he had em the owners of the magazine had raised his the editor s salary he had just installed in his home a jewel of a recently imported cook who was afraid of policemen and the morning papers had published in full a speech he had made at a publishers banquet also there were echoing in his mind the jubilant notes of a splendid song that his charming young wife had sung to him before he left his up town apartment that morning she was taking enthusiastic interest in her music of late practising early and diligently when he had complimented her on the improvement in her voice she had fairly hugged him for joy at his praise he felt too the benign tonic medicament of the trained nurse spring tripping softly adown the wards of the convalescent city while editor westbrook was sauntering between the rows of park benches already filling with vagrants and the guardians of lawless childhood he felt his sleeve grasped and held suspecting that he was about to be panhandled he turned a cold and unprofitable face and saw that his captor was dawe shackleford dawe dingy almost ragged the genteel scracely visible in him through the deeper lines of the shabby while the editor is pulling himself out of his surprise a flashlight biography of dawe is offered he was a fiction writer and one of westbrook s old acquaintances at one time they might have called each other old friends dawe had some money in those days and lived in a decent apartment house near westbrook s the two families often went to theatres and dinners together mrs dawe and mrs westbrook became dearest friends then one day a little tentacle of the octopus just to amuse itself ingurgitated dawe s capital and he moved to the gramercy park neighborhood where one for a few groats per week may sit upon one s trunk under eight branched chandeliers and opposite carrara marble mantels and watch the mice play upon the floor dawe thought to live by writing fiction now and then he sold a story he submitted many to westbrook the minerva printed one or two of them the rest were returned westbrook sent a careful and conscientious personal letter with each rejected manuscript pointing out in detail his reasons for considering it unavailable editor westbrook had his own clear conception of what constituted good fiction so had dawe mrs dawe was mainly concerned about the constituents of the scanty dishes of food that she managed to scrape together one day dawe had been spouting to her about the excellencies of certain french writers at dinner they sat down to a dish that a hungry schoolboy could have encompassed at a gulp dawe commented it s maupassant hash said mrs dawe it may not be art but i do wish you would do a five course marion crawford serial with an ella wheeler wilcox sonnet for dessert i m hungry as far as this from success was shackleford dawe when he plucked editor westbrook s sleeve in madison square that was the first time the editor had seen dawe in several months why shack is this you said westbrook somewhat awkwardly for the form of his phrase seemed to touch upon the other s changed appearance sit down for a minute said dawe tugging at his sleeve this is my office i can t come to yours looking as i do oh sit down you won t be disgraced those half plucked birds on the other benches will take you for a swell porch climber they won t know you are only an editor smoke shack said editor westbrook sinking cautiously upon the virulent green bench he always yielded gracefully when he did yield dawe snapped at the cigar as a kingfisher darts at a sunperch or a girl pecks at a chocolate cream i have just began the editor oh i know don t finish said dawe give me a match you have just ten minutes to spare how did you manage to get past my office boy and invade my sanctum there he goes now throwing his club at a dog that couldn t read the keep off the grass signs how goes the writing asked the editor look at me said dawe for your answer now don t put on that embarrassed friendly but honest look and ask me why i don t get a job as a wine agent or a cab driver i m in the fight to a finish i know i can write good fiction and i ll force you fellows to admit it yet i ll make you change the spelling of regrets to c h e q u e before i m done with you editor westbrook gazed through his nose glasses with a sweetly sorrowful omniscient sympathetic skeptical expression the copyrighted expression of the editor beleagured by the unavailable contributor have you read the last story i sent you the alarum of the soul asked dawe carefully i hesitated over that story shack really i did it had some good points i was writing you a letter to send with it when it goes back to you i regret never mind the regrets said dawe grimly there s neither salve nor sting in em any more what i want to know is why come now out with the good points first the story said westbrook deliberately after a suppressed sigh is written around an almost original plot characterization the best you have done construction almost as good except for a few weak joints which might be strengthened by a few changes and touches it was a good story except i can write english can t i interrupted dawe i have always told you said the editor that you had a style then the trouble is same old thing said editor westbrook you work up to your climax like an artist and then you turn yourself into a photographer i don t know what form of obstinate madness possesses you but that is what you do with everything that you write no i will retract the comparison with the photographer now and then photography in spite of its impossible perspective manages to record a fleeting glimpse of truth but you spoil every d enouement by those flat drab obliterating strokes of your brush that i have so often complained of if you would rise to the literary pinnacle of your dramatic senses and paint them in the high colors that art requires the postman would leave fewer bulky self addressed envelopes at your door oh fiddles and footlights cried dawe derisively you ve got that old sawmill drama kink in your brain yet when the man with the black mustache kidnaps golden haired bessie you are bound to have the mother kneel and raise her hands in the spotlight and say may high heaven witness that i will rest neither night nor day till the heartless villain that has stolen me child feels the weight of another s vengeance editor westbrook conceded a smile of impervious complacency i think said he that in real life the woman would express herself in those words or in very similar ones not in a six hundred nights run anywhere but on the stage said dawe hotly i ll tell you what she d say in real life she d say what bessie led away by a strange man good lord it s one trouble after another get my other hat i must hurry around to the police station why wasn t somebody looking after her i d like to know for god s sake get out of my way or i ll never get ready not that hat the brown one with the velvet bows bessie must have been crazy she s usually shy of strangers is that too much powder lordy how i m upset that s the way she d talk continued dawe people in real life don t fly into heroics and blank verse at emotional crises they simply can t do it if they talk at all on such occasions they draw from the same vocabulary that they use every day and muddle up their words and ideas a little more that s all shack said editor westbrook impressively did you ever pick up the mangled and lifeless form of a child from under the fender of a street car and carry it in your arms and lay it down before the distracted mother did you ever do that and listen to the words of grief and despair as they flowed spontaneously from her lips i never did said dawe did you well no said editor westbrook with a slight frown but i can well imagine what she would say so can i said dawe and now the fitting time had come for editor westbrook to play the oracle and silence his opinionated contributor it was not for an unarrived fictionist to dictate words to be uttered by the heroes and heroines of the minerva magazine contrary to the theories of the editor thereof my dear shack said he if i know anything of life i know that every sudden deep and tragic emotion in the human heart calls forth an apposite concordant conformable and proportionate expression of feeling how much of this inevitable accord between expression and feeling should be attributed to nature and how much to the influence of art it would be difficult to say the sublimely terrible roar of the lioness that has been deprived of her cubs is dramatically as far above her customary whine and purr as the kingly and transcendent utterances of lear are above the level of his senile vaporings but it is also true that all men and women have what may be called a sub conscious dramatic sense that is awakened by a sufficiently deep and powerful emotion a sense unconsciously acquired from literature and the stage that prompts them to express those emotions in language befitting their importance and histrionic value and in the name of the seven sacred saddle blankets of sagittarius where did the stage and literature get the stunt asked dawe from life answered the editor triumphantly the story writer rose from the bench and gesticulated eloquently but dumbly he was beggared for words with which to formulate adequately his dissent on a bench nearby a frowzy loafer opened his red eyes and perceived that his moral support was due a downtrodden brother punch him one jack he called hoarsely to dawe w at s he come makin a noise like a penny arcade for amongst gen lemen that comes in the square to set and think editor westbrook looked at his watch with an affected show of leisure tell me asked dawe with truculent anxiety what especial faults in the alarum of the soul caused you to throw it down when gabriel murray said westbrook goes to his telephone and is told that his fianc ee has been shot by a burglar he says i do not recall the exact words but i do said dawe he says damn central she always cuts me off and then to his friend say tommy does a thirty two bullet make a big hole it s kind of hard luck ain t it could you get me a drink from the sideboard tommy no straight nothing on the side and again continued the editor without pausing for argument when berenice opens the letter from her husband informing her that he has fled with the manicure girl her words are let me see she says interposed the author well what do you think of that absurdly inappropriate words said westbrook presenting an anti climax plunging the story into hopeless bathos worse yet they mirror life falsely no human being ever uttered banal colloquialisms when confronted by sudden tragedy wrong said dawe closing his unshaven jaws doggedly i say no man or woman ever spouts high falutin talk when they go up against a real climax they talk naturally and a little worse the editor rose from the bench with his air of indulgence and inside information say westbrook said dawe pinning him by the lapel would you have accepted the alarum of the soul if you had believed that the actions and words of the characters were true to life in the parts of the story that we discussed it is very likely that i would if i believed that way said the editor but i have explained to you that i do not if i could prove to you that i am right i m sorry shack but i m afraid i haven t time to argue any further just now i don t want to argue said dave i want to demonstrate to you from life itself that my view is the correct one how could you do that asked westbrook in a surprised tone listen said the writer seriously i have thought of a way it is important to me that my theory of true to life fiction be recognized as correct by the magazines i ve fought for it for three years and i m down to my last dollar with two months rent due i have applied the opposite of your theory said the editor in selecting the fiction for the minerva magazine the circulation has gone up from ninety thousand to four hundred thousand said dawe whereas it should have been boosted to a million you said something to me just now about demonstrating your pet theory i will if you ll give me about half an hour of your time i ll prove to you that i am right i ll prove it by louise your wife exclaimed westbrook how well not exactly by her but with her said dawe now you know how devoted and loving louse has always been she thinks i m the only genuine preparation on the market that bears the old doctor s signature she s been fonder and more faithful than ever since i ve been cast for the neglected genius part indeed she is a charming and admirable life companion agreed the editor i remember what inseparable friends she and mrs westbrook once were we are both lucky chaps shack to have such wives you must bring mrs dawe up some evening soon and we ll have one of those informal chafing dish suppers that we used to enjoy so much later said dawe when i get another shirt and now i ll tell you my scheme when i was about to leave home after breakfast if you can call tea and oatmeal breakfast louise told me she was going to visit her aunt in eighty ninth street she said she would return at three o clock she is always on time to a minute it is now dawe glanced toward the editor s watch pocket twenty seven minutes to three said westbrook scanning his time piece we have just enough time said dawe we will go to my flat at once i will write a note address it to her and leave it on the table where she will see it as she enters the door you and i will be in the dining room concealed by the porti eres in that note i ll say that i have fled from her forever with an affinity who understands the need of my artistic soul as she never did when she reads it we will observe her actions and hear her words then we will know which theory is the correct one yours or mine oh never exclaimed the editor shaking his head that would be inexcusably cruel i could not consent to have mrs dawe s feelings played upon in such a manner brace up said the writer i guess i think as much of her as you do it s for her benefit as well as mine i ve got to get a market for my stories in some way it won t hurt louise she s healthy and sound her heart goes as strong as a ninety eight cent watch it ll last for only a minute and then i ll step out and explain to her you really owe it to me to give me the chance westbrook editor westbrook at length yielded though but half willingly and in the half of him that consented lurked the vivisectionist that is in all of us let him who has not used the scalpel rise and stand in his place pity tis that there are not enough rabbits and guinea pigs to go around the two experimenters in art left the square and hurried eastward and then to that south until they arrived in the gramercy neighborhood within its high iron railings the little park had put on its smart coat of vernal green and was admiring itself in its fountain mirror outside the railings the hollow square of crumbling houses shells of a bygone gentry leaned as if in ghostly gossip over the forgotten doings of the vanished quality sic transit gloria urbis a block or two north of the park dawe steered the editor again eastward then after covering a short distance into a lofty but narrow flathouse burdened with a floridly over decorated fa cade to the fifth story they toiled and dawe panting pushed his latch key into the door of one of the front flats when the door opened editor westbrook saw with feelings of pity how meanly and meagerly the rooms were furnished get a chair if you can find one said dawe while i hunt up pen and ink hello what s this here s a note from louise she must have left it there when she went out this morning he picked up an envelope that lay on the centre table and tore it open he began to read the letter that he drew out of it and once having begun it aloud he so read it through to the end these are the words that editor westbrook heard dear shackleford by the time you get this i will be about a hundred miles away and still a going i ve got a place in the chorus of the occidental opera co and we start on the road to day at twelve o clock i didn t want to starve to death and so i decided to make my own living i m not coming back mrs westbrook is going with me she said she was tired of living with a combination phonograph iceberg and dictionary and she s not coming back either we ve been practising the songs and dances for two months on the quiet i hope you will be successful and get along all right good bye louise dawe dropped the letter covered his face with his trembling hands and cried out in a deep vibrating voice my god why hast thou given me this cup to drink since she is false then let thy heaven s fairest gifts faith and love become the jesting by words of traitors and fiends editor westbrook s glasses fell to the floor the fingers of one hand fumbled with a button on his coat as he blurted between his pale lips say shack ain t that a hell of a note wouldn t that knock you off your perch shack ain t it hell now shack ain t it past one at rooney s only on the lower east side of new york do the houses of capulet and montagu survive there they do not fight by the book of arithmetic if you but bite your thumb at an upholder of your opposing house you have work cut out for your steel on broadway you may drag your man along a dozen blocks by his nose and he will only bawl for the watch but in the domain of the east side tybalts and mercutios you must observe the niceties of deportment to the wink of any eyelash and to an inch of elbow room at the bar when its patrons include foes of your house and kin so when eddie mcmanus known to the capulets as cork mcmanus drifted into dutch mike s for a stein of beer and came upon a bunch of montagus making merry with the suds he began to observe the strictest parliamentary rules courtesy forbade his leaving the saloon with his thirst unslaked caution steered him to a place at the bar where the mirror supplied the cognizance of the enemy s movements that his indifferent gaze seemed to disdain experience whispered to him that the finger of trouble would be busy among the chattering steins at dutch mike s that night close by his side drew brick cleary his mercutio companion of his perambulations thus they stood four of the mulberry hill gang and two fo the dry dock gang minding their p s and q s so solicitously that dutch mike kept one eye on his customers and the other on an open space beneath his bar in which it was his custom to seek safety whenever the ominous politeness of the rival associations congealed into the shapes of bullets and cold steel but we have not to do with the wars of the mulberry hills and the dry docks we must to rooney s where on the most blighted dead branch of the tree of life a little pale orchid shall bloom overstrained etiquette at last gave way it is not known who first overstepped the bounds of punctilio but the consequences were immediate buck malone of the mulberry hills with a dewey like swiftness got an eight inch gun swung round from his hurricane deck but mcmanus s simile must be the torpedo he glided in under the guns and slipped a scant three inches of knife blade between the ribs of the mulberry hill cruiser meanwhile brick cleary a devotee to strategy had skimmed across the lunch counter and thrown the switch of the electrics leaving the combat to be waged by the light of gunfire alone dutch mike crawled from his haven and ran into the street crying for the watch instead of for a shakespeare to immortalize the cimmerian shindy the cop came and found a prostrate bleeding montagu supported by three distrait and reticent followers of the house faithful to the ethics of the gangs no one knew whence the hurt came there was no capulet to be seen raus mit der interrogatories said buck malone to the officer sure i know who done it i always manages to get a bird s eye view of any guy that comes up an makes a show case for a hardware store out of me no i m not telling you his name i ll settle with um meself wow ouch easy boys yes i ll attend to his case meself i m not making any complaint at midnight mcmanus strolled around a pile of lumber near an east side dock and lingered in the vicinity of a certain water plug brick cleary drifted casually to the trysting place ten minutes later he ll maybe not croak said brick and he won t tell of course but dutch mike did he told the police he was tired of having his place shot up it s unhandy just now because tim corrigan s in europe for a week s end with kings he ll be back on the kaiser williams next friday you ll have to duck out of sight till then tim ll fix it up all right for us when he comes back this goes to explain why cork mcmanus went into rooney s one night and there looked upon the bright stranger face of romance for the first time in his precarious career until tim corrigan should return from his jaunt among kings and princes and hold up his big white finger in private offices it was unsafe for cork in any of the old haunts of his gang so he lay perdu in the high rear room of a capulet reading pink sporting sheets and cursing the slow paddle wheels of the kaiser wilhelm it was on thursday evening that cork s seclusion became intolerable to him never a hart panted for water fountain as he did for the cool touch of a drifting stein for the firm security of a foot rail in the hollow of his shoe and the quiet hearty challenges of friendship and repartee along and across the shining bars but he must avoid the district where he was known the cops were looking for him everywhere for news was scarce and the newspapers were harping again on the failure of the police to suppress the gangs if they got him before corrigan came back the big white finger could not be uplifted it would be too late then but corrigan would be home the next day so he felt sure there would be small danger in a little excursion that night among the crass pleasures that represented life to him at half past twelve mcmanus stood in a darkish cross town street looking up at the name rooney s picked out by incandescent lights against a signboard over a second story window he had heard of the place as a tough hang out with its frequenters and its locality he was unfamiliar guided by certain unerring indications common to all such resorts he ascended the stairs and entered the large room over the caf e here were some twenty or thirty tables at this time about half filled with rooney s guests waiters served drinks at one end a human pianola with drugged eyes hammered the keys with automatic and furious unprecision at merciful intervals a waiter would roar or squeak a song songs full of mr jonsons and babes and coons historical word guaranties of the genuineness of african melodies composed by red waistcoated young gentlemen natives of the cotton fields and rice swamps of west twenty eighth street for one brief moment you must admire rooney with me as he receives seats manipulates and chaffs his guests he is twenty nine he has wellington s nose dante s chin the cheek bones of an iroquois the smile of talleyrand corbett s foot work and the pose of an eleven year old east side central park queen of the may he is assisted by a lieutenant known as frank a pudgy easy chap swell dressed who goes among the tables seeing that dull care does not intrude now what is there about rooney s to inspire all this pother it is more respectable by daylight stout ladies with children and mittens and bundles and unpedigreed dogs drop up of afternoons for a stein and a chat even by gaslight the diversions are melancholy i the mouth drink and rag time and an occasional surprise when the waiter swabs the suds from under your sticky glass there is an answer transmigration the soul of sir walter raleigh has traveled from beneath his slashed doublet to a kindred home under rooney s visible plaid waistcoat rooney s is twenty years ahead of the times rooney has removed the embargo rooney has spread his cloak upon the soggy crossing of public opinion and any elizabeth who treads upon it is as much a queen as another attend to the revelation of the secret in rooney s ladies may smoke mcmanus sat down at a vacant table he paid for the glass of beer that he ordered tilted his narrow brimmed derby to the back of his brick dust head twined his feet among the rungs of his chair and heaved a sigh of contentment from the breathing spaces of his innermost soul for this mud honey was clarified sweetness to his taste the sham gaiety the hectic glow of counterfeit hospitality the self conscious joyless laughter the wine born warmth the loud music retrieving the hour from frequent whiles of awful and corroding silence the presence of well clothed and frank eyed beneficiaries of rooney s removal of the restrictions laid upon the weed the familiar blended odors of soaked lemon peel flat beer and peau d espagne all these were manna to cork mcmanus hungry for his week in the desert of the capulet s high rear room a girl alone entered rooney s glanced around with leisurely swiftness and sat opposite mcmanus at his table her eyes rested upon him for two seconds in the look with which woman reconnoitres all men whom she for the first time confronts in that space of time she will decide upon one of two things either to scream for the police or that she may marry him later on her brief inspection concluded the girl laid on the table a worn red morocco shopping bag with the inevitable top gallant sail of frayed lace handkerchief flying from a corner of it after she had ordered a small beer from the immediate waiter she took from her bag a box of cigarettes and lighted one with slightly exaggerated ease of manner then she looked again in the eyes of cork mcmanus and smiled instantly the doom of each was sealed the unqualified desire of a man to buy clothes and build fires for a woman for a whole lifetime at first sight of her is not uncommon among that humble portion of humanity that does not care for bradstreet or coats of arms or shaw s plays love at first sight has occurred a time or two in high life but as a rule the extempore mania is to be found among unsophisticated cratures such as the dove the blue tailed dingbat and the ten dollar a week clerk poets subscribers to all fiction magazines and schatchens take notice with the exchange of the mysterious magnetic current came to each of them the instant desire to lie pretend dazzle and deceive which is the worst thing about the hypocritical disorder known as love have another beer suggested cork in his circle the phrase was considered to be a card accompanied by a letter of introduction and references no thanks said the girl raising her eyebrows and choosing her conventional words carefully i merely dropped in for a slight refreshment the cigarette between her fingers seemed to require explanation my aunt is a russian lady she concluded and we often have a post perannual cigarette after dinner at home cheese it said cork whom society airs oppressed your fingers are as yellow as mine say said the girl blazing upon him with low voiced indignation what do you think i am say who do you think you are talking to what she was pretty to look at her eyes were big brown intrepid and bright uner her flat sailor hat planted jauntily on one side her crinkly tawny hair parted and was drawn back low and massy in a thick pendant knot behind the roundness of girlhood still lingered in her chin and neck but her cheeks and fingers were thinning slightly she looked upon the world with defiance suspicion and sullen wonder her smart short tan coat was soiled and expensive two inches below her black dress dropped the lowest flounce of a heliotrope silk underskirt beg your pardon said cork looking at her admiringly i didn t mean anything sure it s no harm to smoke maudy rooney s said the girl softened at once by his amends is the only place i know where a lady can smoke maybe it ain t a nice habit but aunty lets us at home and my name ain t maudy if you please it s ruby delamere that s a swell handle said cork approvingly mine s mcmanus cor er eddie mcmanus oh you can t help that laughed ruby don t apologize cork looked seriously at the big clock on rooney s wall the girl s ubiquitous eyes took in the movement i know it s late she said reaching for her bag but you know how you want a smoke when you want one ain t rooney s all right i never saw anything wrong here this is twice i ve been in i work in a bookbindery on third avenue a lot of us girls have been working overtime three nights a week they won t let you smoke there of course i just dropped in here on my way home for a puff ain t it all right in here if it ain t i won t come any more it s a little bit late for you to be out alone anywhere said cork i m not wise to this particular joint but anyhow you don t want to have your picture taken in it for a present to your sunday school teacher have one more beer and then say i take you home but i don t know you said the girl with fine scrupulosity i don t accept the company of gentlemen i ain t acquainted with my aunt never would allow that why said cork mcmanus pulling his ear i m the latest thing in suitings with side vents and bell skirt when it comes to escortin a lady you bet you ll find me all right ruby and i ll give you a tip as to who i am my governor is one of the hottest cross buns of the wall street push morgan s cab horse casts a shoe every time the old man sticks his head out the window me well i m in trainin down the street the old man s goin to put a seat on the stock exchange in my stockin my next birthday but it all sounds like a lemon to me what i like is golf and yachtin and er well say a corkin fast ten round bout between welter weights with walkin gloves i guess you can walk to the door with me said the girl hesitatingly but with a certain pleased flutter still i never heard anything extra good about wall street brokers or sport who go to prize fights either ain t you got any other recommendations i think you re the swellest looker i ve had my lamps on in little old new york said cork impressively that ll be about enough of that now ain t you the kidder she modified her chiding words by a deep long beaming smile embellished look at her cavalier we ll drink our beer before we go ha a waiter sang the tobacco smoke grew denser drifting and rising in spirals waves tilted layers cumulus clouds cataracts and suspended fogs like some fifth element created from the ribs of the ancient four laughter and chat grew louder stimulated by rooney s liquids and rooney s gallant hospitality to lady nicotine one o clock struck down stairs there was a sound of closing and locking doors frank pulled down the green shades of the front windows carefully rooney went below in the dark hall and stood at the front door his cigarette cached in the hollow of his hand thenceforth whoever might seek admittance must present a countenance familiar to rooney s hawk s eye the countenance of a true sport cork mcmanus and the bookbindery girl conversed absorbedly with their elbows on the table their glasses of beer were pushed to one side scarcely touched with the foam on them sunken to a thin white scum since the stroke of one the stale pleasures of rooney s had become renovated and spiced not by any addition to the list of distractions but because from that moment the sweets became stolen ones the flattest glass of beer acquired the tang of illegality the mildest claret punch struck a knockout blow at law and order the harmless and genial company became outlaws defying authority and rule for after the stroke of one in such places as rooney s where neither bed nor board is to be had drink may not be set before the thirsty of the city of the four million it is the law say said cork mcmanus almost covering the table with his eloquent chest and elbows was that dead straight about you workin in the bookbindery and livin at home and just happenin in here and and all that spiel you gave me sure it was answered the girl with spirit why what do you think do you suppose i d lie to you go down to the shop and ask em i handed it to you on the level on the dead level said cork that s the way i want it because because what i throw up my hands said cork you ve got me goin you re the girl i ve been lookin for will you keep company with me ruby would you like me to eddie surest thing but i wanted a straight story about about yourself you know when a fellow had a girl a steady girl she s got to be all right you know she s got to be straight goods you ll find i ll be straight goods eddie of course you will i believe what you told me but you can t blame me for wantin to find out you don t see many girls smokin cigarettes in places like rooney s after midnight that are like you the girl flushed a little and lowered her eyes i see that now she said meekly i didn t know how bad it looked but i won t do it any more and i ll go straight home every night and stay there and i ll give up cigarettes if you say so eddie i ll cut em out from this minute on cork s air became judicial proprietary condemnatory yet sympathetic a lady can smoke he decided slowly at times and places why because it s bein a lady that helps her pull it off i m going to quit there s nothing to it said the girl she flicked the stub of her cigarette to the floor at times and places repeated cork when i call round for you of evenin s we ll hunt out a dark bench in stuyvesant square and have a puff or two but no more rooney s at one o clock see eddie do you really like me the girl searchd his hard but frank features eagerly with anxious eyes on the dead level when are you coming to see me where i live thursday day after to morrow evenin that suit you fine i ll be ready for you come about seven walk to the door with me to night and i ll show you where i live don t forget now and don t you go to see any other girls before then mister i bet you will though on the dead level said cork you make em all look like rag dolls to me honest you do i know when i m suited on the dead level i do against the front door down stairs repeated heavy blows were delivered the loud crashes resounded in the room above only a trip hammer or a policeman s foot could have been the author of those sounds rooney jumped like a bullfrog to a corner of the room turned off the electric lights and hurried swiftly below the room was left utterly dark except for the winking red glow of cigars and cigarettes a second volley of crashes came up from the assaulted door a little rustling murmuring panic moved among the besieged guests frank cool smooth reassuring could be seen in the rosy glow of the burning tobacco going from table to table all keep still was his caution don t talk or make any noise everything will be all right now don t feel the slightest alarm we ll take care of you all ruby felt across the table until cork s firm hand closed upon hers are you afraid eddie she whispered are you afraid you ll get a free ride nothin doin in the teeth chatterin line said cork i guess rooney s been slow with his envelope don t you worry girly i ll look out for you all right yet mr mcmanus s ease was only skin and muscle deep with the police looking everywhere for buck malone s assailant and with corrigan still on the ocean wave he felt that to be caught in a police raid would mean an ended career for him he wished he had remained in the high rear room of the true capulet reading the pink extras rooney seemed to have opened the front door below and engaged the police in conference in the dark hall the wordless low growl of their voices came up the stairway frank made a wireless news station of himself at the upper door suddenly he closed the door hurried to the extreme rear of the room and lighted a dim gas jet this way everybody he called sharply in a hurry but no noise please the guests crowded in confusion to the rear rooney s lieutenant swung open a panel in the wall overlooking the back yard revealing a ladder already placed for the escape down and out everybody he commanded ladies first less talking please don t crowd there s no danger among the last cork and ruby waited their turn at the open panel suddenly she swept him aside and clung to his arm fiercely before we go out she whispered in his ear before anything happens tell me again eddie do you l do you really like me on the dead level said cork holding her close with one arm when it comes to you i m all in when they turned they found they were lost and in darkness the last of the fleeing customers had descended half way across the yard they bore the ladder stumbling giggling hurrying to place it against adjoining low building over the roof of which their only route to safety we may as well sit down said cork grimly maybe rooney will stand the cops off anyhow they sat at a table and their hands came together again a number of men then entered the dark room feeling their way about one of them rooney himself found the switch and turned on the electric light the other man was a cop of the old regime a big cop a thick cop a fuming abrupt cop not a pretty cop he went up to the pair at the table and sneered familiarly at the girl what are youse doin in here he asked dropped in for a smoke said cork mildly had any drinks not later than one o clock get out quick ordered the cop then sit down he countermanded he took off cork s hat roughly and scrutinized him shrewdly your name s mcmanus bad guess said cork it s peterson cork mcmanus or something like that said the cop you put a knife into a man in dutch mike s saloon a week ago aw forget it said cork who perceived a shade of doubt in the officer s tones you ve got my mug mixed with somebody else s have i well you ll come to the station with me anyhow and be looked over the description fits you all right the cop twisted his fingers under cork s collar come on he ordered roughly cork glanced at ruby she was pale and her thin nostrils quivered her quick eye danced from one man s face to the other as they spoke or moved what hard luck cork was thinking corrigan on the briny and ruby met and lost almost within an hour somebody at the police station would recognize him without a doubt hard luck but suddenly the girl sprang up and hurled herself with both arms extended against the cop his hold on cork s collar was loosened and he stumbled back two or three paces don t go so fast maguire she cried in shrill fury keep your hands off my man you know me and you know i m givin you good advice don t you touch him again he s not the guy you are lookin for i ll stand for that see here fanny said the cop red and angry i ll take you too if you don t look out how do you know this ain t the man i want what are you doing in here with him how do i know said the girl flaming red and white by turns because i ve known him a year he s mine oughtn t i to know and what am i doin here with him that s easy she stooped low and reached down somewhere into a swirl of flirted draperies heliotrope and black an elastic snapped she threw on the table toward cork a folded wad of bills the money slowly straightened itself with little leisurely jerks take that jimmy and let s go said the girl i m declarin the usual dividends maguire she said to the officer you had your usual five dollar graft at the usual corner at ten a lie said the cop turning purple you go on my beat again and i ll arrest you every time i see you no you won t said the girl and i ll tell you why witnesses saw me give you the money to night and last week too i ve been getting fixed for you cork put the wad of money carefuly into his pocket and said come on fanny let s have some chop suey before we go home clear out quick both of you or i ll the cop s bluster trailed away into inconsequentiality at the corner of the street the two halted cork handed back the money without a word the girl took it and slipped it slowly into her hand bag her expression was the same she had worn when she entered rooney s that night she looked upon the world with defiance suspicion and sullen wonder i guess i might as well say good bye here she said dully you won t want to see me again of course will you shake hands mr mcmanus i mightn t have got wise if you hadn t give the snap away said cork why did you do it you d have been pinched if i hadn t that s why ain t that reason enough then she began to cry honest eddie i was goin to be the best girl in the world i hated to be what i am i hated men i was ready almost to die when i saw you and you seemed different from everybody else and when i found you liked me too why i thought i d make you believe i was good and i was goin to be good when you asked to come to my house and see me why i d have died rather than do anything wrong after that but what s the use of talking about it i ll say good by if you will mr mcmanus cork was pulling at his ear i knifed malone said he i was the one the cop wanted oh that s all right said the girl listlessly it didn t make any difference about that that was all hot air about wall street i don t do nothin but hang out with a tough gang on the east side that was all right too repeated the girl it didn t make any difference cork straightened himself and pulled his hat down low i could get a job at o brien s he said aloud but to himself good by said the girl come on said cork taking her arm i know a place two blocks away he turned with her up the steps of a red brick house facing a little park what house is this she asked drawing back why are you going in there a street lamp shone brightly in front there was a brass nameplate at one side of the closed front doors cork drew her firmly up the steps read that said he she looked at the name on the plate and gave a cry between a moan and a scream no no no eddie oh my god no i won t let you do that not now let me go you shan t do that you can t you mus n t not after you know no no come away quick oh my god please eddie come half fainting she reeled and was caught in the bend of his arm cork s right hand felt for the electric button and pressed it long another cop how quickly they scent trouble when trouble is on the wing came along saw them and ran up the steps here what are you doing with that girl he called gruffly she ll be all right in a minute said cork it s a straight deal reverend jeremiah jones read the cop from the door plate with true detective cunning correct said cork on the dead level we re goin to get married the venturers let the story wreck itself on the spreading rails of the non sequitur limited if it will first you must take your seat in the observation car raison d tre for one moment it is for no longer than to consider a brief essay on the subject let us call it what s around the corner omne mundus in duas partes divisum est men who wear rubbers and pay poll taxes and men who discover new continents there are no more continents to discover but by the time overshoes are out of date and the poll has developed into an income tax the other half will be paralleling the canals of mars with radium railways fortune chance and adventure are given as synonymous in the dictionaries to the knowing each has a different meaning fortune is a prize to be won adventure is the road to it chance is what may lurk in the shadows at the roadside the face of fortune is radiant and alluring that of adventure is flushed and heroic the face of chance is the beautiful countenance perfect because vague and dream born that we see in our tea cups at breakfast while we growl over our chops and toast the venturer is one who keeps his eye on the hedgerows and wayside groves and meadows while he travels the road to fortune that is the difference between him and the adventurer eating the forbidden fruit was the best record ever made by a venturer trying to prove that it happened is the highest work of the adventuresome to be either is disturbing to the cosmogony of creation so as bracket sawed and city directoried citizens let us light our pipes chide the children and the cat arrange ourselves in the willow rocker under the flickering gas jet at the coolest window and scan this little tale of two modern followers of chance did you ever hear that story about the man from the west asked billinger in the little dark oak room to your left as you penetrate the interior of the powhatan club doubtless said john reginald forster rising and leaving the room forster got his straw hat straws will be in and maybe out again long before this is printed from the checkroom boy and walked out of the air as hamlet says billinger was used to having his stories insulted and would not mind forster was in his favorite mood and wanted to go away from anywhere a man in order to get on good terms with himself must have his opinions corroborated and his moods matched by some one else i had written that somebody but an a d t boy who once took a telegram for me pointed out that i could save money by using the compound word this is a vice versa case forster s favorite mood was that of greatly desiring to be a follower of chance he was a venturer by nature but convention birth tradition and the narrowing influences of the tribe of manhattan had denied him full privilege he had trodden all the main traveled thoroughfares and many of the side roads that are supposed to relieve the tedium of life but none had sufficed the reason was that he knew what was to be found at the end of every street he knew from experience and logic almost precisely to what end each digression from routine must lead he found a depressing monotony in all the variations that the music of his sphere had grafted upon the tune of life he had not learned that although the world was made round the circle has been squared and that it s true interest is to be in what s around the corner forster walked abroad aimlessly from the powhatan trying not to tax either his judgment or his desire as to what streets he traveled he would have been glad to lose his way if it were possible but he had no hope of that adventure and fortune move at your beck and call in the greater city but chance is oriental she is a veiled lady in a sedan chair protected by a special traffic squad of dragonians crosstown uptown and downtown you may move without seeing her at the end of an hour s stroll forster stood on a corner of a broad smooth avenue looking disconsolately across it at a picturesque old hotel softly but brilliantly lit disconsolately because he knew that he must dine and dining in that hotel was no venture it was one of his favorite caravansaries and so silent and swift would be the service and so delicately choice the food that he regretted the hunger that must be appeased by the dead perfection of the place s cuisine even the music there seemed to be always playing da capo fancy came to him that he would dine at some cheap even dubious restaurant lower down in the city where the erratic chefs from all countries of the world spread their national cookery for the omnivorous american something might happen there out of the routine he might come upon a subject without a predicate a road without an end a question without an answer a cause without an effect a gulf stream in life s salt ocean he had not dressed for evening he wore a dark business suit that would not be questioned even where the waiters served the spaghetti in their shirt sleeves so john reginald forster began to search his clothes for money because the more cheaply you dine the more surely must you pay all of the thirteen pockets large and small of his business suit he explored carefully and found not a penny his bank book showed a balance of five figures to his credit in the old ironsides trust company but forster became aware of a man nearby at his left hand who was really regarding him with some amusement he looked like any business man of thirty or so neatly dressed and standing in the attitude of one waiting for a street car but there was no car line on that avenue so his proximity and unconcealed curiosity seemed to forster to partake of the nature of a personal intrusion but as he was a consistent seeker after what s around the corner instead of manifesting resentment he only turned a half embarrassed smile upon the other s grin of amusement all in asked the intruder drawing nearer seems so said forster now i thought there was a dollar in oh i know said the other man with a laugh but there wasn t i ve just been through the same process myself as i was coming around the corner i found in an upper vest pocket i don t know how they got there exactly two pennies you know what kind of a dinner exactly two pennies will buy you haven t dined then asked forster i have not but i would like to now i ll make you a proposition you look like a man who would take up one your clothes look neat and respectable excuse personalities i think mine will pass the scrutiny of a head waiter also suppose we go over to that hotel and dine together we will choose from the menu like millionaires or if you prefer like gentlemen in moderate circumstances dining extravagantly for once when we have finished we will match with my two pennies to see which of us will stand the brunt of the house s displeasure and vengeance my name is ives i think we have lived in the same station of life before our money took wings you re on said forster joyfully here was a venture at least within the borders of the mysterious country of change anyhow it promised something better than the stale infestivity of a table d h ote the two were soon seated at a corner table in the hotel dining room ives chucked one of his pennies across the table to forster match for which of us gives the order he said forster lost ives laughed and began to name liquids and viands to the waiter with the absorbed but calm deliberation of one who was to the menu born forster listening gave his admiring approval of the order i am a man said ives during the oysters who has made a lifetime search after the to be continued in our next i am not like the ordinary adventurer who strikes for a coveted prize nor yet am i like a gambler who knows he is either to win or lose a certain set stake what i want is to encounter an adventure to which i can predict no conclusion it is the breath of existence to me to dare fate in its blindest manifestations the world has come to run so much by rote and gravitation that you can enter upon hardly any footpath of chance in which you do not find signboards informing you of what you may expect at its end i am like the clerk in the circumlocution office who always complained bitterly when any one came in to ask information he wanted to know you know was the kick he made to his fellow clerks well i don t want to know i don t want to reason i don t want to guess i want to bet my hand without seeing it i understand said forster delightedly i ve often wanted the way i feel put into words you ve done it i want to take chances on what s coming suppose we have a bottle of moselle with the next course agreed said ives i m glad you catch my idea it will increase the animosity of the house toward the loser if it does not weary you we will pursue the theme only a few times have i met a true venturer one who does not ask a schedule and map from fate when he begins a journey but as the world becomes more civilized and wiser the more difficult it is to come upon an adventure the end of which you cannot foresee in the elizabethan days you could assault the watch wring knockers from doors and have a jolly set to with the blades in any convenient angle of a wall and get away with it nowadays if you speak disrespectfully to a policeman all that is left to the most romantic fancy is to conjecture in what particular police station he will land you i know i know said forster nodding approval i returned to new york to day continued ives from a three years ramble around the globe things are not much better abroad than they are at home the whole world seems to be overrun by conclusions the only thing that interests me greatly is a premise i ve tried shooting big game in africa i know what an express rifle will do at so many yards and when an elephant or a rhinoceros falls to the bullet i enjoy it about as much as i did when i was kept in after school to do a sum in long division on the blackboard i know i know said forster there might be something in aeroplanes went on ives reflectively i ve tried ballooning but it seems to be merely a cut and dried affair of wind and ballast women suggested forster with a smile three months ago said ives i was pottering around in one of the bazaars in constantinople i noticed a lady veiled of course but with a pair of especially fine eyes visible who was examining some amber and pearl ornaments at one of the booths with her was an attendant a big nubian as black as coal after a while the attendant drew nearer to me by degrees and slipped a scrap of paper into my hand i looked at it when i got a chance on it was scrawled hastily in pencil the arched gate of the nghtingale garden at nine to night does that appear to you to be an interesting premise mr forster i made inquiries and learned that the nightingale garden was the property of an old turk a grand vizier or something of the sort of course i prospected for the arched gate and was there at nine the same nubian attendant opened the gate promptly on time and i went inside and sat on a bench by a perfumed fountain with the veiled lady we had quite an extended chat she was myrtle thompson a lady journalist who was writing up the turkish harems for a chicago newspaper she said she noticed the new york cut of my clothes in the bazaar and wondered if i couldn t work something into the metropolitan papers about it i see said forster i see i ve canoed through canada said ives down many rapids and over many falls but i didn t seem to get what i wanted out of it because i knew there were only two possible outcomes i would either go to the bottom or arrive at the sea level i ve played all games at cards but the mathematicians have spoiled that sport by computing the percentages i ve made acquaintances on trains i ve answered advertisements i ve rung strange door bells i ve taken every chance that presented itself but there has always been the conventional ending the logical conclusion to the premise i know repeated forster i ve felt it all but i ve had few chances to take my chance at chances is there any life so devoid of impossibilities as life in this city there seems to be a myriad of opportunities for testing the undeterminable but not one in a thousand fails to land you where you expected it to stop i wish the subways and street cars disappointed one as seldom the sun has risen said ives on the arabian nights there are no more caliphs the fisherman s vase is turned to a vacuum bottle warranted to keep any genie boiling or frozen for forty eight hours life moves by rote science has killed adventure there are no more opportunities such as columbus and the man who ate the first oyster had the only certain thing is that there is nothing uncertain well said forster my experience has been the limited one of a city man i haven t seen the world as you have but it seems that we view it with the same opinion but i tell you i am grateful for even this little venture of ours into the borders of the haphazard there may be at least one breathless moment when the bill for the dinner is presented perhaps after all the pilgrims who traveled without scrip or purse found a keener taste to life than did the knights of the round table who rode abroad with a retinue and king arthur s certified checks in the lining of their helmets and now if you ve finished your coffee suppose we match one of your insufficient coins for the impending blow of fate what have i up heads called ives heads it is said forster lifting his hand i lose we forgot to agree upon a plan for the winner to escape i suggest that when the waiter comes you make a remark about telephoning to a friend i will hold the fort and the dinner check long enough for you to get your hat and be off i thank you for an evening out of the ordinary mr ives and wish we might have others if my memory is not at fault said ives laughing the nearest police station is in macdougal street i have enjoyed the dinner too let me assure you forster crooked his finger for the waiter victor with a locomotive effort that seemed to owe more to pneumatics than to pedestrianism glided to the table and laid the card face downward by the loser s cup forster took it up and added the figures with deliberate care ives leaned back comfortably in his chair escuse me said forster but i though you were going to ring grimes about that theatre party for thursday night had you forgotten about it oh said ives settling himself more comfortably i can do that later on get me a glass of water waiter want to be in at the death do you asked forster i hope you don t object said ives pleadingly never in my life have i seen a gentleman arrested in a public restaurant for swindling it out of a dinner all right said forster calmly you are entitled to see a christian die in the arena as your pousse caf victor came with the glass of water and remained with the disengaged air of an inexorable collector forster hesitated for fifteen seconds and then took a pencil from his pocket and scribbled his name on the dinner check the waiter bowed and took it away the fact is said forster with a little embarrassed laugh i doubt whether i m what they call a game sport which means the same as a soldier of fortune i ll have to make a confession i ve been dining at this hotel two or three times a week for more than a year i always sign my checks and then with a note of appreciation in his voice it was first rate of you to stay to see me through with it when you knew i had no money and that you might be scooped in too i guess i ll confess too said ives with a grin i own the hotel i don t run it of course but i always keep a suite on the third floor for my use when i happen to stray into town he called a waiter and said i s mr gilmore still behind the desk all right tell him that mr ives is here and ask him to have my rooms made ready and aired another venture cut short by the inevitable said forster is there a conundrum without an answer in the next number but let s hold to our subject just for a minute or two if you will it isn t often that i meet a man who understands the flaws i pick in existence i am engaged to be married a month from to day i reserve comment said ives right i am going to add to the assertion i am devotedly fond of the lady but i can t decide whether to show up at the church or make a sneak for alaska it s the same idea you know that we were discussing it does for a fellow as far as possibilities are concerned everybody knows the routine you get a kiss flavored with ceylon tea after breakfast you go to the office you come back home and dress for dinner theatre twice a week bills moping around most evenings trying to make conversation a little quarrel occasionally maybe sometimes a big one and a separation or else a settling down into a middle aged contentment which is worst of all i know said ives nodding wisely it s the dead certainty of the thing went on forster that keeps me in doubt there ll nevermore be anything around the corner nothing after the little church said ives i know understand said forster that i am in no doubt as to my feelings toward the lady i may say that i love her truly and deeply but there is something in the current that runs through my veins that cries out against any form of the calculable i do not know what i want but i know that i want it i m talking like an idiot i suppose but i m sure of what i mean i understand you said ives with a slow smile well i think i will be going up to my rooms now if you would dine with me here one evening soon mr forster i d be glad thursday suggested forster at seven if it s convenient answered ives seven goes assented forster at halft past eight ives got into a cab and was driven to a number in one of the correct west seventies his card admitted him to the reception room of an old fashioned house into which the spirits of fortune chance and adventure had never dared to enter on the walls were the whistler etchings the steel engravings by oh what s his name the still life paintings of the grapes and garden truck with the watermelon seeds spilled on the table as natural as life and the greuze head it was a household there was even brass andirons on a table was an album half morocco with oxidized silver protections on the corners of the lids a clock on the mantel ticked loudly with a warning click at five minutes to nine ives looked at it curiously remembering a time piece in his grandmother s home that gave such a warning and then down the stairs and into the room came mary marsden she was twenty four and i leave her to your imagination but i must say this much youth and health and simplicity and courage and greenish violet eyes are beautiful and she had all these she gave ives her hand with the sweet cordiality of an old friendship you can t think what a pleasure it is she said to have you drop in once every three years or so for half an hour they talked i confess that i cannot repeat the conversation you will find it in books in the circulating library when that part of it was over mary said and did you find what you wanted while you were abroad what i wanted said ives yes you know you were always queer even as a boy you wouldn t play marbles or baseball or any game with rules you wanted to dive in water where you didn t know whether it was ten inches or ten feet deep and when you grew up you were just the same we ve often talked about your peculiar ways i suppose i am an incorrigible said ives i am opposed to the doctrine of predestination to the rule of three gravitation taxation and everything of the kind life has always seemed to me something like a serial story would be if they printed above each instalment a synopsis of succeeding chapters mary laughed merrily bob ames told us once she said of a funny thing you did it was when you and he were on a train in the south and you got off at a town where you hadn t intended to stop just because the brakeman hung up a sign in the end of the car with the name of the next station on it i remember said ives that next station has been the thing i ve always tried to get away from i know it said mary and you ve been very foolish i hope you didn t find what you wanted not to find or get off at the station where there wasn t any or whatever it was you expected wouldn t happen to you during the three years you ve been away there was something i wanted before i went away said ives mary looked in his eyes clearly with a slight but perfectly sweet smile there was she said you wanted me and you could have had me as you very well know without replying ives let his gaze wander slowly about the room there had been no change in it since last he had been in it three years before he vividly recalled the thoughts that had been in his mind then the contents of that room were as fixed in their way as the everlasting hills no change would ever come there except the inevitable ones wrought by time and decay that silver mounted album would occupy that corner of that table those pictures would hang on the walls those chairs be found in their same places every morn and noon and night while the household hung together the brass andirons were monuments to order and stability herre and there were relics of a hundred years ago which were still living mementos and would be for many years to come one going from and coming back to that house would never need to forecast or doubt he would find what he left and leave what he found the veiled lady chance would never lift her hand to the knocker on the outer door and before him sat the lady who belonged in the room cool and sweet and unchangeable she was she offered no surprises if one should pass his life with her though she might grow white haired and wrinkled he would never perceive the change three years he had been away from her and she was still waiting for him as established and constant as the house itself he was sure that she had once cared for him it was the knowledge that she would always do so that had driven him away thus his thoughts ran i am going to be married soon said mary on the next thursday afternoon forster came hurriedly to ive s hotel old man said he we ll have to put that dinner off for a year or so i m going abroad the steamer sails at four that was a great talk we had the other night and it decided me i m going to knock around the world and get rid of that incubus that has been weighing on both you and me the terrible dread of knowing what s going to happen i ve done one thing that hurts my conscience a little but i know it s best for both of us i ve written to the lady to whom i was engaged and explained everything told her plainly why i was leaving that the monotony of matrimony would never do for me don t you think i was right it is not for me to say answered ives go ahead and shoot elephants if you think it will bring the element of chance into your life we ve got to decide these things for ourselves but i tell you one thing forster i ve found the way i ve found out the biggest hazard in the world a game of chance that never is concluded a venture that may end in the highest heaven or the blackest pit it will keep a man on edge until the clods fall on his coffin because he will never know not until his last day and not then will he know it is a voayge without a rudder or compass and you must be captain and crew and keep watch every day and night yourself with no one to relieve you i have found the venture don t bother yourself about leaving mary marsden forster i married her yesterday at noon the duel the gods lying beside their nectar on lympus and peeping over the edge of the cliff perceive a difference in cities although it would seem that to their vision towns must appear as large or small ant hills without special characteristics yet it is not so studying the habits of ants frm so great a height should be but a mild diversion when coupled with the soft drink that mythology tells us is their only solace but doubtless they have amused themselves by the comparison of villages and towns and it will be no news to them nor perhaps to many mortals that in one particularity new york stands unique among the cities of the world this shall be the theme of a little story addressed to the man who sits smoking with his sabbath slippered feet on another chair and to the woman who snatches the paper for a moment while boiling greens or a narcotized baby leaves her free with these i love to sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings new york city is inhabited by mysterious strangers thus beating bird centre by three millions and half a dozen nine s they came here in various ways and for many reasons hendrik hudson the art schools green goods the stork the annual dressmakers convention the pennsylvania railroad love of money the stage cheap excursion rates brains personal column ads heavy walking shoes ambition freight trains all these have had a hand in making up the population but every man jack when he first sets foot on the stones of manhattan has got to fight he has got to fight at once until either he or his adversary wins there is no resting between rounds for there are no rounds it is slugging from the first it is a fight to a finish your opponent is the city you must do battle with it from the time the ferry boat lands you on the island until either it is yours or it has conquered you it is the same whether you have a million in your pocket or only the price of a week s lodging the battle is to decide whether you shall become a new yorker or turn the rankest outlander and philistine you must be one or the other you cannot remain neutral you must be for or against lover or enemy bosom friend or outcast and oh the city is a general in the ring not only by blows does it seek to subdue you it woos you to its heart with the subtlety of a siren it is a combination of delilah green chartreuse beethoven chloral and john l in his best days in other cities you may wander and abide as a stranger man as long as you please you may live in chicago until your hair whitens and be a citizen and still prate of beans if boston mothered you and without rebuke you may become a civic pillar in any other town but knickerbocker s and all the time publicly sneering at its buildings comparing them with the architecture of colonel telfair s residence in jackson miss whence you hail and you will not be set upon but in new york you must be either a new yorker or an invader of a modern troy concealed in the wooden horse of your conceited provincialism and this dreary preamble is only to introduce to you the unimportant figures of william and jack they came out of the west together where they had been friends they came to dig their fortunes out of the big city father knickerbocker met them at the ferry giving one a right hander on the nose and the other an upper cut with his left just to let them know that the fight was on william was for business jack was for art both were young and ambitious so they countered and clinched i think they were from nebraska or possibly missouri or minnesota anyhow they were out for success and scraps and scads and they tackled the city like two lochinvars with brass knucks and a pull at the city hall four years afterward william and jack met at luncheon the business man blew in like a march wind hurled his silk hat at a waiter dropped into the chair that was pushed under him seized the bill of fare and had ordered as far as cheese before the artist had time to do more than nod after the nod a humorous smile came into his eyes billy he said you re done for the city has gobbled you up it has taken you and cut you to its pattern and stamped you with its brand you are so nearly like ten thousand men i have seen to day that you couldn t be picked out from them if it weren t for your laundry marks camembert finished william what s that oh you ve still got your hammer out for new york have you well little old noisyville on the subway is good enough for me it s giving me mine and say i used to think the west was the whole round world only slightly flattened at the poles whenever bryan ran i used to yell myself hoarse about the free expense and hang my hat on the horizon and say cutting things in the grocery to little soap drummers from the east but i d never seen new york then jack me for it from the rathskellers up sixth avenue is the west to me now have you heard this fellow crusoe sing the desert isle for him i say but my wife made me go give me may irwin or e s willard any time poor billy said the artist delicately fingering a cigarette you remember when we were on our way to the east how we talked about this great wonderful city and how we meant to conquer it and never let it get the best of us we were going to be just the same fellows we had always been and never let it master us it has downed you old man you have changed from a maverick into a butterick don t see exactly what you are driving at said william i don t wear an alpaca coat with blue trousers and a seersucker vest on dress occasions like i used to do at home you talk about being cut to a pattern well ain t the pattern all right when you re in rome you ve got to do as the dagoes do this town seems to me to have other alleged metropolises skinned to flag stations according to the railroad schedule i ve got in mind chicago and saint jo and paris france are asterisk stops which means you wave a red flag and get on every other tuesday i like this little suburb of tarrytown on the hudson there s something or somebody doing all the time i m clearing a year selling automatic pumps and i m living like kings up why yesterday i was introduced to john w gates i took an auto ride with a wine agent s sister i saw two men run over by a street car and i seen edna may play in the evening talk about the west why the other night i woke everybody up in the hotel hollaring i dreamed i was walking on a board sidewalk in oshkosh what have you got against this town jack there s only one thing in it that i don t care for and that s a ferryboat the artist gazed dreamily at the cartridge paper on the wall this town said he is a leech it drains the blood of the country whoever comes to it accepts a challenge to a duel abandoning the figure of the leech it is a juggernaut a moloch a monster to which the innocence the genius and the beauty of the land must pay tribute hand to hand every newcomer must struggle with the leviathan you ve lost billy it shall never conquer me i hate it as one hates sin or pestilence or the color work in a ten cent magazine i despise its very vastness and power it has the poorest millionaires the littlest great men the lowest skyscrapers the dolefulest pleasures of any town i ever saw it has caught you old man but i will never run beside its chariot wheels it glosses itself as the chinaman glosses his collars give me the domestic finish i could stand a town ruled by wealth or one ruled by an aristocracy but this is one controlled by its lowest ingredients claiming culture it is the crudest asseverating its pre eminence it is the basest denying all outside values and virtue it is the narrowest give me the pure and the open heart of the west country i would go back there to morrow if i could don t you like this filet mignon said william shucks now what s the use to knock the town it s the greatest ever i couldn t sell one automatic pump between harrisburg and tommy o keefe s saloon in sacramento where i sell twenty here and have you seen sara bernardt in andrew mack yet the town s got you billy said jack all right said william i m going to buy a cottage on lake ronkonkoma next summer at midnight jack raised his window and sat close to it he caught his breath at what he saw though he had seen and felt it a hundred times far below and around lay the city like a ragged purple dream the irregular houses were like the broken exteriors of cliffs lining deep gulches and winding streams some were mountainous some lay in long desert ca ons such was the background of the wonderful cruel enchanting bewildering fatal great city but into this background were cut myriads of brilliant parallelograms and circles and squares through which glowed many colored lights and out of the violet and purple depths ascended like the city s soul sounds and odors and thrills that make up the civic body there arose the breath of gaiety unrestrained of love of hate of all the passions that man can know there below him lay all things good or bad that can be brought from the four corners of the earth to instruct please thrill enrich despoil elevate cast down nurture or kill thus the flavor of it came up to him and went into his blood there was a knock on his door a telegram had come for him it came from the west and these were its words come back and the answer will be yes dolly he kept the boy waiting ten minutes and then wrote the reply impossible to leave here at present then he sat at the window again and let the city put its cup of mandragora to his lips again after all it isn t a story but i wanted to know which one of the heroes won the battle against the city so i went to a very learned friend and laid the case before him what he said was please don t bother me i have christmas presents to buy so there it rests and you will have to decide for yourself what you want night had fallen on that great and beautiful city known as bagdad on the subway and with the night came the enchanted glamour that belongs not to arabia alone in different masquerade the streets bazaars and walled houses of the occidental city of romance were filled with the same kind of folk that so much interested our interesting old friend the late mr h a rashid they wore clothes eleven hundred years nearer to the latest styles than h a saw in old bagdad but they were about the same people underneath with the eye of faith you could have seen the little hunchback sinbad the sailor fitbad the tailor the beautiful persian the one eyed calenders ali baba and forty robbers on every block and the barber and his six brothers and all the old arabian gang easily but let us revenue to our lamb chops old tom crowley was a caliph he had in preferred stocks and bonds with solid gold edges in these times to be called a caliph you must have money the old style caliph business as conducted by mr rashid is not safe if you hold up a person nowadays in a bazaar or a turkish bath or a side street and inquire into his private and personal affairs the police court ll get you old tom was tired of clubs theatres dinners friends music money and everything that s what makes a caliph you must get to despise everything that money can buy and then go out and try to want something that you can t pay for i ll take a little trot around town all by myself thought old tom and try if i can stir up anything new let s see it seems i ve read about a king or a cardiff giant or something in old times who used to go about with false whiskers on making persian dates with folks he hadn t been introduced to that don t listen like a bad idea i certainly have got a case of humdrumness and fatigue on for the ones i do know that old cardiff used to pick up cases of trouble as he ran upon em and give em gold sequins i think it was and make em marry or got em good government jobs now i d like something of that sort my money is as good as his was even if the magazines do ask me every month where i got it yes i guess i ll do a little cardiff business to night and see how it goes plainly dressed old tom crowley left his madison avenue palace and walked westward and then south as he stepped to the sidewalk fate who holds the ends of the strings in the central offices of all the enchanted cities pulled a thread and a young man twenty blocks away looked at a wall clock and then put on his coat james turner worked in one of those little hat cleaning establishments on sixth avenue in which a fire alarms rings when you push the door open and where they clean your hat while you wait two days james stood all day at an electric machine that turned hats around faster than the best brands of champagne ever could have done overlooking your mild impertinence in feeling a curiosity about the personal appearance of a stranger i will give you a modified description of him weight complexion hair and brain light height five feet six age about twenty three dressed in a suit of greenish blue serge pockets containing two keys and sixty three cents in change but do not misconjecture because this description sounds like a general alarm that james was either lost or a dead one allons james stood all day at his work his feet were tender and extremely susceptible to impositions being put upon or below them all day long they burned and smarted causing him much suffering and inconvenience but he was earning twelve dollars per week which he needed to support his feet whether his feet would support him or not james turner had his own conception of what happiness was just as you and i have ours your delight is to gad about the world in yachts and motor cars and to hurl ducats at wild fowl mine is to smoke a pipe at evenfall and watch a badger a rattlesnake and an owl go into their common prairie home one by one james turner s idea of bliss was different but it was his he would go directly to his boarding house when his day s work was done after his supper of small steak bessemer potatoes stooed not stewed apples and infusion of chicory he would ascend to his fifth floor back hall room then he would take off his shoes and socks place the soles of his burning feet against the cold bars of his iron bed and read clark russell s sea yarns the delicious relief of the cool metal applied to his smarting soles was his nightly joy his favorite novels never palled upon him the sea and the adventures of its navigators were his sole intellectual passion no millionaire was ever happier than james turner taking his ease when james left the hat cleaning shop he walked three blocks out of his way home to look over the goods of a second hand bookstall on the sidewalk stands he had more than once picked up a paper covered volume of clark russell at half price while he was bending with a scholarly stoop over the marked down miscellany of cast off literature old tom the caliph sauntered by his discerning eye made keen by twenty years experience in the manufacture of laundry soap save the wrappers recognized instantly the poor and discerning scholar a worthy object of his caliphanous mood he descended the two shallow stone steps that led from the sidewalk and addressed without hesitation the object of his designed munificence his first words were no worse than salutatory and tentative james turner looked up coldly with sartor resartus in one hand and a mad marriage in the other beat it said he i don t want to buy any coat hangers or town lots in hankipoo new jersey run along now and play with your teddy bear young man said the caliph ignoring the flippancy of the hat cleaner i observe that you are of a studious disposition learning is one of the finest things in the world i never had any of it worth mentioning but i admire to see it in others i come from the west where we imagine nothing but facts maybe i couldn t understand the poetry and allusions in them books you are picking over but i like to see somebody else seem to know what they mean i m worth about and i m getting richer every day i made the height of it manufacturing aunt patty s silver soap i invented the art of making it i experimented for three years before i got just the right quantity of chloride of sodium solution and caustic potash mixture to curdle properly and after i had taken some out of the soap business i made the rest in corn and wheat futures now you seem to have the literary and scholarly turn of character and i ll tell you what i ll do i ll pay for your education at the finest college in the world i ll pay the expense of your rummaging over europe and the art galleries and finally set you up in a good business you needn t make it soap if you have any objections i see by your clothes and frazzled necktie that you are mighty poor and you can t afford to turn down the offer well when do you want to begin the hat cleaner turned upon old tom the eye of the big city which is an eye expressive of cold and justifiable suspicion of judgment suspended as high as haman was hung of self preservation of challenge curiosity defiance cynicism and strange as you may think it of a childlike yearning for friendliness and fellowship that must be hidden when one walks among the stranger bands for in new bagdad one in order to survive must suspect whosoever sits dwells drinks rides walks or sleeps in the adjacent chair house booth seat path or room say mike said james turner what s your line anyway shoe laces i m not buying anything you better put an egg in your shoe and beat it before incidents occur to you you can t work off any fountain pens gold spectacles you found on the street or trust company certificate house clearings on me say do i look like i d climbed down one of them missing fire escapes at helicon hall what s vitiating you anyhow son said the caliph in his most harunish tones as i said i m worth i don t want to have it all put in my coffin when i die i want to do some good with it i seen you handling over these here volumes of literature and i thought i d keep you i ve give the missionary societies but what did i get out of it nothing but a receipt from the secretary now you are just the kind of young man i d like to take up and see what money could make of him volumes of clark russell were hard to find that evening at the old book shop and james turner s smarting and aching feet did not tend to improve his temper humble hat cleaner though he was he had a spirit equal to any caliph s say you old faker he said angrily be on your way i don t know what your game is unless you want change for a bogus bill well i don t carry that much around with me but i do carry a pretty fair left handed punch that you ll get if you don t move on you are a blamed impudent little gutter pup said the caliph then james delivered his self praised punch old tom seized him by the collar and kicked him thrice the hat cleaner rallied and clinched two bookstands were overturned and the books sent flying a copy came up took an arm of each and marched them to the nearest station house fighting and disorderly conduct said the cop to the sergeant three hundred dollars bail said the sergeant at once asseveratingly and inquiringly sixty three cents said james turner with a harsh laugh the caliph searched his pockets and collected small bills and change amounting to four dollars i am worth he said forty million dollars but lock em up ordered the sergeant in his cell james turner laid himself on his cot ruminating maybe he s got the money and maybe he ain t but if he has or he ain t what does he want to go round butting into other folks s business for when a man knows what he wants and can get it it s the same as to him then an idea came to him that brought a pleased look to his face he removed his socks drew his cot close to the door stretched himself out luxuriously and placed his tortured feet against the cold bars of the cell door something hard and bulky under the blankets of his cot gave one shoulder discomfort he reached under and drew out a paper covered volume by clark russell called a sailor s sweetheart he gave a great sigh of contentment presently to his cell came the doorman and said say kid that old gazabo that was pinched with you for scrapping seems to have been the goods after all he phoned to his friends and he s out at the desk now with a roll of yellowbacks as big as a pullman car pillow he wants to bail you and for you to come out and see him tell him i ain t in said james turner sixes and sevens the last of the troubadours inexorably sam galloway saddled his pony he was going away from the rancho altito at the end of a three months visit it is not to be expected that a guest should put up with wheat coffee and biscuits yellow streaked with saleratus for longer than that nick napoleon the big negro man cook had never been able to make good biscuits once before when nick was cooking at the willow ranch sam had been forced to fly from his cuisine after only a six weeks sojourn on sam s face was an expression of sorrow deepened with regret and slightly tempered by the patient forgiveness of a connoisseur who cannot be understood but very firmly and inexorably he buckled his saddle cinches looped his stake rope and hung it to his saddle horn tied his slicker and coat on the cantle and looped his quirt on his right wrist the merrydews householders of the rancho altito men women children and servants vassals visitors employes dogs and casual callers were grouped in the gallery of the ranch house all with faces set to the tune of melancholy and grief for as the coming of sam galloway to any ranch camp or cabin between the rivers frio or bravo del norte aroused joy so his departure caused mourning and distress and then during absolute silence except for the bumping of a hind elbow of a hound dog as he pursued a wicked flea sam tenderly and carefully tied his guitar across his saddle on top of his slicker and coat the guitar was in a green duck bag and if you catch the significance of it it explains sam sam galloway was the last of the troubadours of course you know about the troubadours the encyclopaedia says they flourished between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries what they flourished doesn t seem clear you may be pretty sure it wasn t a sword maybe it was a fiddlebow or a forkful of spaghetti or a lady s scarf anyhow sam galloway was one of em sam put on a martyred expression as he mounted his pony but the expression on his face was hilarious compared with the one on his pony s you see a pony gets to know his rider mighty well and it is not unlikely that cow ponies in pastures and at hitching racks had often guyed sam s pony for being ridden by a guitar player instead of by a rollicking cussing all wool cowboy no man is a hero to his saddle horse and even an escalator in a department store might be excused for tripping up a troubadour oh i know i m one and so are you you remember the stories you memorize and the card tricks you study and that little piece on the piano how does it go ti tum te tum ti tum those little arabian ten minute entertainments that you furnish when you go up to call on your rich aunt jane you should know that omnae personae in tres partes divisae sunt namely brons troubadours and workers barons have no inclination to read such folderol as this and workers have no time so i know you must be a troubadour and that you will understand sam galloway whether we sing act dance write lecture or paint we are only troubadours so let us make the worst of it the pony with the dante alighieri face guided by the pressure of sam s knees bore that wandering minstrel sixteen miles southeastward nature was in her most benignant mood league after league of delicate sweet flowerets made fragrant the gently undulating prairie the east wind tempered the spring warmth wool white clouds flying in from the mexican gull hindered the direct rays of the april sun sam sang songs as he rode under his pony s bridle he had tucked some sprigs of chaparral to keep away the deer flies thus crowned the long faced quadruped looked more dantesque than before and judging by his countenance seemed to think of beatrice straight as topography permitted sam rode to the sheep ranch of old man ellison a visit to a sheep ranch seemed to him desirable just then there had been too many people too much noise argument competition confusion at rancho altito he had never conferred upon old man ellison the favour of sojourning at his ranch but he knew he would be welcome the troubadour is his own passport everywhere the workers in the castle let down the drawbridge to him and the baron sets him at his left hand at table in the banquet hall there ladies smile upon him and applaud his songs and stories while the workers bring boars heads and flagons if the baron nods once or twice in his carved oaken chair he does not do it maliciously old man ellison welcomed the troubadour flatteringly he had often heard praises of sam galloway from other ranchmen who had been complimented by his visits but had never aspired to such an honour for his own humble barony i say barony because old man ellison was the last of the barons of course mr bulwer lytton lived too early to know him or he wouldn t have conferred that sobriquet upon warwick in life it is the duty and the function of the baron to provide work for the workers and lodging and shelter for the troubadours old man ellison was a shrunken old man with a short yellow white beard and a face lined and seamed by past and gone smiles his ranch was a little two room box house in a grove of hackberry trees in the lonesomest part of the sheep country his household consisted of a kiowa indian man cook four hounds a pet sheep and a half tamed coyote chained to a fence post he owned sheep which he ran on two sections of leased land and many thousands of acres neither leased nor owned three or four times a year some one who spoke his language would ride up to his gate and exchange a few bald ideas with him those were red letter days to old man ellison then in what illuminated embossed and gorgeously decorated capitals must have been written the day on which a troubadour a troubadour who according to the encyclopaedia should have flourished between the eleventh and the thirteenth centuries drew rein at the gates of his baronial castle old man ellison s smiles came back and filled his wrinkles when he saw sam he hurried out of the house in his shuffling limping way to greet him hello mr ellison called sam cheerfully thought i d drop over and see you a while notice you ve had fine rains on your range they ought to make good grazing for your spring lambs well well well said old man ellison i m mighty glad to see you sam i never thought you d take the trouble to ride over to as out of the way an old ranch as this but you re mighty welcome light i ve got a sack of new oats in the kitchen shall i bring out a feed for your hoss oats for him said sam derisively no sir ee he s as fat as a pig now on grass he don t get rode enough to keep him in condition i ll just turn him in the horse pasture with a drag rope on if you don t mind i am positive that never during the eleventh and thirteenth centuries did baron troubadour and worker amalgamate as harmoniously as their parallels did that evening at old man ellison s sheep ranch the kiowa s biscuits were light and tasty and his coffee strong ineradicable hospitality and appreciation glowed on old man ellison s weather tanned face as for the troubadour he said to himself that he had stumbled upon pleasant places indeed a well cooked abundant meal a host whom his lightest attempt to entertain seemed to delight far beyond the merits of the exertion and the reposeful atmosphere that his sensitive soul at that time craved united to confer upon him a satisfaction and luxurious ease that he had seldom found on his tours of the ranches after the delectable supper sam untied the green duck bag and took out his guitar not by way of payment mind you neither sam galloway nor any other of the true troubadours are lineal descendants of the late tommy tucker you have read of tommy tucker in the works of the esteemed but often obscure mother goose tommy tucker sang for his supper no true troubadour would do that he would have his supper and then sing for art s sake sam galloway s repertoire comprised about fifty funny stories and between thirty and forty songs he by no means stopped there he could talk through twenty cigarettes on any topic that you brought up and he never sat up when he could lie down and never stood when he could sit i am strongly disposed to linger with him for i am drawing a portrait as well as a blunt pencil and a tattered thesaurus will allow i wish you could have seen him he was small and tough and inactive beyond the power of imagination to conceive he wore an ultramarine blue woollen shirt laced down the front with a pearl gray exaggerated sort of shoestring indestructible brown duck clothes inevitable high heeled boots with mexican spurs and a mexican straw sombrero that evening sam and old man ellison dragged their chairs out under the hackberry trees they lighted cigarettes and the troubadour gaily touched his guitar many of the songs he sang were the weird melancholy minor keyed canciones that he had learned from the mexican sheep herders and vaqueros one in particular charmed and soothed the soul of the lonely baron it was a favourite song of the sheep herders beginning huile huile palomita which being translated means fly fly little dove sam sang it for old man ellison many times that evening the troubadour stayed on at the old man s ranch there was peace and quiet and appreciation there such as he had not found in the noisy camps of the cattle kings no audience in the world could have crowned the work of poet musician or artist with more worshipful and unflagging approval than that bestowed upon his efforts by old man ellison no visit by a royal personage to a humble woodchopper or peasant could have been received with more flattering thankfulness and joy on a cool canvas covered cot in the shade of the hackberry trees sam galloway passed the greater part of his time there he rolled his brown paper cigarettes read such tedious literature as the ranch afforded and added to his repertoire of improvisations that he played so expertly on his guitar to him as a slave ministering to a great lord the kiowa brought cool water from the red jar hanging under the brush shelter and food when he called for it the prairie zephyrs fanned him mildly mocking birds at morn and eve competed with but scarce equalled the sweet melodies of his lyre a perfumed stillness seemed to fill all his world while old man ellison was pottering among his flocks of sheep on his mile an hour pony and while the kiowa took his siesta in the burning sunshine at the end of the kitchen sam would lie on his cot thinking what a happy world he lived in and how kind it is to the ones whose mission in life it is to give entertainment and pleasure here he had food and lodging as good as he had ever longed for absolute immunity from care or exertion or strife an endless welcome and a host whose delight at the sixteenth repetition of a song or a story was as keen as at its initial giving was there ever a troubadour of old who struck upon as royal a castle in his wanderings while he lay thus meditating upon his blessings little brown cottontails would shyly frolic through the yard a covey of white topknotted blue quail would run past in single file twenty yards away a paisano bird out hunting for tarantulas would hop upon the fence and salute him with sweeping flourishes of its long tail in the eighty acre horse pasture the pony with the dantesque face grew fat and almost smiling the troubadour was at the end of his wanderings old man ellison was his own vaciero that means that he supplied his sheep camps with wood water and rations by his own labours instead of hiring a vaciero on small ranches it is often done one morning he started for the camp of incarnacion felipe de la cruz y monte piedras one of his sheep herders with the week s usual rations of brown beans coffee meal and sugar two miles away on the trail from old fort ewing he met face to face a terrible being called king james mounted on a fiery prancing kentucky bred horse king james s real name was james king but people reversed it because it seemed to fit him better and also because it seemed to please his majesty king james was the biggest cattleman between the alamo plaza in san antone and bill hopper s saloon in brownsville also he was the loudest and most offensive bully and braggart and bad man in southwest texas and he always made good whenever he bragged and the more noise he made the more dangerous he was in the story papers it is always the quiet mild mannered man with light blue eyes and a low voice who turns out to be really dangerous but in real life and in this story such is not the case give me my choice between assaulting a large loudmouthed rough houser and an inoffensive stranger with blue eyes sitting quietly in a corner and you will see something doing in the corner every time king james as i intended to say earlier was a fierce two hundred pound sunburned blond man as pink as an october strawberry and with two horizontal slits under shaggy red eyebrows for eyes on that day he wore a flannel shirt that was tan coloured with the exception of certain large areas which were darkened by transudations due to the summer sun there seemed to be other clothing and garnishings about him such as brown duck trousers stuffed into immense boots and red handkerchiefs and revolvers and a shotgun laid across his saddle and a leather belt with millions of cartridges shining in it but your mind skidded off such accessories what held your gaze was just the two little horizontal slits that he used for eyes this was the man that old man ellison met on the trail and when you count up in the baron s favour that he was sixty five and weighed ninety eight pounds and had heard of king james s record and that he the baron had a hankering for the vita simplex and had no gun with him and wouldn t have used it if he had you can t censure him if i tell you that the smiles with which the troubadour had filled his wrinkles went out of them and left them plain wrinkles again but he was not the kind of baron that flies from danger he reined in the mile an hour pony no difficult feat and saluted the formidable monarch king james expressed himself with royal directness you re that old snoozer that s running sheep on this range ain t you said he what right have you got to do it do you own any land or lease any i have two sections leased from the state said old man ellison mildly not by no means you haven t said king james your lease expired yesterday and i had a man at the land office on the minute to take it up you don t control a foot of grass in texas you sheep men have got to git your time s up it s a cattle country and there ain t any room in it for snoozers this range you ve got your sheep on is mine i m putting up a wire fence forty by sixty miles and if there s a sheep inside of it when it s done it ll be a dead one i ll give you a week to move yours away if they ain t gone by then i ll send six men over here with winchesters to make mutton out of the whole lot and if i find you here at the same time this is what you ll get king james patted the breech of his shot gun warningly old man ellison rode on to the camp of incarnacion he sighed many times and the wrinkles in his face grew deeper rumours that the old order was about to change had reached him before the end of free grass was in sight other troubles too had been accumulating upon his shoulders his flocks were decreasing instead of growing the price of wool was declining at every clip even bradshaw the storekeeper at frio city at whose store he bought his ranch supplies was dunning him for his last six months bill and threatening to cut him off and so this last greatest calamity suddenly dealt out to him by the terrible king james was a crusher when the old man got back to the ranch at sunset he found sam galloway lying on his cot propped against a roll of blankets and wool sacks fingering his guitar hello uncle ben the troubadour called cheerfully you rolled in early this evening i been trying a new twist on the spanish fandango to day i just about got it here s how she goes listen that s fine that s mighty fine said old man ellison sitting on the kitchen step and rubbing his white scotch terrier whiskers i reckon you ve got all the musicians beat east and west sam as far as the roads are cut out oh i don t know said sam reflectively but i certainly do get there on variations i guess i can handle anything in five flats about as well as any of em but you look kind of fagged out uncle ben ain t you feeling right well this evening little tired that s all sam if you ain t played yourself out let s have that mexican piece that starts off with huile huile palomita it seems that that song always kind of soothes and comforts me after i ve been riding far or anything bothers me why seguramente senor said sam i ll hit her up for you as often as you like and before i forget about it uncle ben you want to jerk bradshaw up about them last hams he sent us they re just a little bit strong a man sixty five years old living on a sheep ranch and beset by a complication of disasters cannot successfully and continuously dissemble moreover a troubadour has eyes quick to see unhappiness in others around him because it disturbs his own ease so on the next day sam again questioned the old man about his air of sadness and abstraction then old man ellison told him the story of king james s threats and orders and that pale melancholy and red ruin appeared to have marked him for their own the troubadour took the news thoughtfully he had heard much about king james on the third day of the seven days of grace allowed him by the autocrat of the range old man ellison drove his buckboard to frio city to fetch some necessary supplies for the ranch bradshaw was hard but not implacable he divided the old man s order by two and let him have a little more time one article secured was a new fine ham for the pleasure of the troubadour five miles out of frio city on his way home the old man met king james riding into town his majesty could never look anything but fierce and menacing but to day his slits of eyes appeared to be a little wider than they usually were good day said the king gruffly i ve been wanting to see you i hear it said by a cowman from sandy yesterday that you was from jackson county mississippi originally i want to know if that s a fact born there said old man ellison and raised there till i was twenty one this man says went on king james that he thinks you was related to the jackson county reeveses was he right aunt caroline reeves said the old man was my half sister she was my aunt said king james i run away from home when i was sixteen now let s re talk over some things that we discussed a few days ago they call me a bad man and they re only half right there s plenty of room in my pasture for your bunch of sheep and their increase for a long time to come aunt caroline used to cut out sheep in cake dough and bake em for me you keep your sheep where they are and use all the range you want how s your finances the old man related his woes in detail dignifiedly with restraint and candour she used to smuggle extra grub into my school basket i m speaking of aunt caroline said king james i m going over to frio city to day and i ll ride back by your ranch to morrow i ll draw out of the bank there and bring it over to you and i ll tell bradshaw to let you have everything you want on credit you are bound to have heard the old saying at home that the jackson county reeveses and kings would stick closer by each other than chestnut burrs well i m a king yet whenever i run a cross a reeves so you look out for me along about sundown to morrow and don t worry about nothing shouldn t wonder if the dry spell don t kill out the young grass old man ellison drove happily ranchward once more the smiles filled out his wrinkles very suddenly by the magic of kinship and the good that lies somewhere in all hearts his troubles had been removed on reaching the ranch he found that sam galloway was not there his guitar hung by its buckskin string to a hackberry limb moaning as the gulf breeze blew across its masterless strings the kiowa endeavoured to explain sam he catch pony said he and say he ride to frio city what for no can damn sabe say he come back to night maybe so that all as the first stars came out the troubadour rode back to his haven he pastured his pony and went into the house his spurs jingling martially old man ellison sat at the kitchen table having a tin cup of before supper coffee he looked contented and pleased hello sam said he i m darned glad to see ye back i don t know how i managed to get along on this ranch anyhow before ye dropped in to cheer things up i ll bet ye ve been skylarking around with some of them frio city gals now that s kept ye so late and then old man ellison took another look at sam s face and saw that the minstrel had changed the man of action and while sam is unbuckling from his waist old man ellison s six shooter that the latter had left behind when he drove to town we may well pause to remark that anywhere and whenever a troubadour lays down the guitar and takes up the sword trouble is sure to follow it is not the expert thrust of athos nor the cold skill of aramis nor the iron wrist of porthos that we have to fear it is the gascon s fury the wild and unacademic attack of the troubadour the sword of d artagnan i done it said sam i went over to frio city to do it i couldn t let him put the skibunk on you uncle ben i met him in summers s saloon i knowed what to do i said a few things to him that nobody else heard he reached for his gun first half a dozen fellows saw him do it but i got mine unlimbered first three doses i gave him right around the lungs and a saucer could have covered up all of em he won t bother you no more this is king james you speak of asked old man ellison while he sipped his coffee you bet it was and they took me before the county judge and the witnesses what saw him draw his gun first was all there well of course they put me under bond to appear before the court but there was four or five boys on the spot ready to sign the bail he won t bother you no more uncle ben you ought to have seen how close them bullet holes was together i reckon playing a guitar as much as i do must kind of limber a fellow s trigger finger up a little don t you think uncle ben then there was a little silence in the castle except for the spluttering of a venison steak that the kiowa was cooking sam said old man ellison stroking his white whiskers with a tremulous hand would you mind getting the guitar and playing that huile huile palomita piece once or twice it always seems to be kind of soothing and comforting when a man s tired and fagged out there is no more to be said except that the title of the story is wrong it should have been called the last of the barons there never will be an end to the troubadours and now and then it does seem that the jingle of their guitars will drown the sound of the muffled blows of the pickaxes and trip hammers of all the workers in the world the sleuths in the big city a man will disappear with the suddenness and completeness of the flame of a candle that is blown out all the agencies of inquisition the hounds of the trail the sleuths of the city s labyrinths the closet detectives of theory and induction will be invoked to the search most often the man s face will be seen no more sometimes he will reappear in sheboygan or in the wilds of terre haute calling himself one of the synonyms of smith and without memory of events up to a certain time including his grocer s bill sometimes it will be found after dragging the rivers and polling the restaurants to see if he may be waiting for a well done sirloin that he has moved next door this snuffing out of a human being like the erasure of a chalk man from a blackboard is one of the most impressive themes in dramaturgy the case of mary snyder in point should not be without interest a man of middle age of the name of meeks came from the west to new york to find his sister mrs mary snyder a widow aged fifty two who had been living for a year in a tenement house in a crowded neighbourhood at her address he was told that mary snyder had moved away longer than a month before no one could tell him her new address on coming out mr meeks addressed a policeman who was standing on the corner and explained his dilemma my sister is very poor he said and i am anxious to find her i have recently made quite a lot of money in a lead mine and i want her to share my prosperity there is no use in advertising her because she cannot read the policeman pulled his moustache and looked so thoughtful and mighty that meeks could almost feel the joyful tears of his sister mary dropping upon his bright blue tie you go down in the canal street neighbourhood said the policeman and get a job drivin the biggest dray you can find there s old women always gettin knocked over by drays down there you might see er among em if you don t want to do that you better go round to headquarters and get em to put a fly cop onto the dame at police headquarters meeks received ready assistance a general alarm was sent out and copies of a photograph of mary snyder that her brother had were distributed among the stations in mulberry street the chief assigned detective mullins to the case the detective took meeks aside and said this is not a very difficult case to unravel shave off your whiskers fill your pockets with good cigars and meet me in the cafe of the waldorf at three o clock this afternoon meeks obeyed he found mullins there they had a bottle of wine while the detective asked questions concerning the missing woman now said mullins new york is a big city but we ve got the detective business systematized there are two ways we can go about finding your sister we will try one of em first you say she s fifty two a little past said meeks the detective conducted the westerner to a branch advertising office of one of the largest dailies there he wrote the following ad and submitted it to meeks wanted at once one hundred attractive chorus girls for a new musical comedy apply all day at no broadway meeks was indignant my sister said he is a poor hard working elderly woman i do not see what aid an advertisement of this kind would be toward finding her all right said the detective i guess you don t know new york but if you ve got a grouch against this scheme we ll try the other one it s a sure thing but it ll cost you more never mind the expense said meeks we ll try it the sleuth led him back to the waldorf engage a couple of bedrooms and a parlour he advised and let s go up this was done and the two were shown to a superb suite on the fourth floor meeks looked puzzled the detective sank into a velvet armchair and pulled out his cigar case i forgot to suggest old man he said that you should have taken the rooms by the month they wouldn t have stuck you so much for em by the month exclaimed meeks what do you mean oh it ll take time to work the game this way i told you it would cost you more we ll have to wait till spring there ll be a new city directory out then very likely your sister s name and address will be in it meeks rid himself of the city detective at once on the next day some one advised him to consult shamrock jolnes new york s famous private detective who demanded fabulous fees but performed miracles in the way of solving mysteries and crimes after waiting for two hours in the anteroom of the great detective s apartment meeks was shown into his presence jolnes sat in a purple dressing gown at an inlaid ivory chess table with a magazine before him trying to solve the mystery of they the famous sleuth s thin intellectual face piercing eyes and rate per word are too well known to need description meeks set forth his errand my fee if successful will be said shamrock jolnes meeks bowed his agreement to the price i will undertake your case mr meeks said jolnes finally the disappearance of people in this city has always been an interesting problem to me i remember a case that i brought to a successful outcome a year ago a family bearing the name of clark disappeared suddenly from a small flat in which they were living i watched the flat building for two months for a clue one day it struck me that a certain milkman and a grocer s boy always walked backward when they carried their wares upstairs following out by induction the idea that this observation gave me i at once located the missing family they had moved into the flat across the hall and changed their name to kralc shamrock jolnes and his client went to the tenement house where mary snyder had lived and the detective demanded to be shown the room in which she had lived it had been occupied by no tenant since her disappearance the room was small dingy and poorly furnished meeks seated himself dejectedly on a broken chair while the great detective searched the walls and floor and the few sticks of old rickety furniture for a clue at the end of half an hour jolnes had collected a few seemingly unintelligible articles a cheap black hat pin a piece torn off a theatre programme and the end of a small torn card on which was the word left and the characters c shamrock jolnes leaned against the mantel for ten minutes with his head resting upon his hand and an absorbed look upon his intellectual face at the end of that time he exclaimed with animation come mr meeks the problem is solved i can take you directly to the house where your sister is living and you may have no fears concerning her welfare for she is amply provided with funds for the present at least meeks felt joy and wonder in equal proportions how did you manage it he asked with admiration in his tones perhaps jolnes s only weakness was a professional pride in his wonderful achievements in induction he was ever ready to astound and charm his listeners by describing his methods by elimination said jolnes spreading his clues upon a little table i got rid of certain parts of the city to which mrs snyder might have removed you see this hatpin that eliminates brooklyn no woman attempts to board a car at the brooklyn bridge without being sure that she carries a hatpin with which to fight her way into a seat and now i will demonstrate to you that she could not have gone to harlem behind this door are two hooks in the wall upon one of these mrs snyder has hung her bonnet and upon the other her shawl you will observe that the bottom of the hanging shawl has gradually made a soiled streak against the plastered wall the mark is clean cut proving that there is no fringe on the shawl now was there ever a case where a middle aged woman wearing a shawl boarded a harlem train without there being a fringe on the shawl to catch in the gate and delay the passengers behind her so we eliminate harlem therefore i conclude that mrs snyder has not moved very far away on this torn piece of card you see the word left the letter c and the number now i happen to know that no avenue c is a first class boarding house far beyond your sister s means as we suppose but then i find this piece of a theatre programme crumpled into an odd shape what meaning does it convey none to you very likely mr meeks but it is eloquent to one whose habits and training take cognizance of the small est things you have told me that your sister was a scrub woman she scrubbed the floors of offices and hallways let us assume that she procured such work to perform in a theatre where is valuable jewellery lost the oftenest mr meeks in the theatres of course look at that piece of programme mr meeks observe the round impression in it it has been wrapped around a ring perhaps a ring of great value mrs snyder found the ring while at work in the theatre she hastily tore off a piece of a programme wrapped the ring carefully and thrust it into her bosom the next day she disposed of it and with her increased means looked about her for a more comfortable place in which to live when i reach thus far in the chain i see nothing impossible about no avenue c it is there we will find your sister mr meeks shamrock jolnes concluded his convincing speech with the smile of a successful artist meeks s admiration was too great for words together they went to no avenue c it was an old fashioned brownstone house in a prosperous and respectable neighbourhood they rang the bell and on inquiring were told that no mrs snyder was known there and that not within six months had a new occupant come to the house when they reached the sidewalk again meeks examined the clues which he had brought away from his sister s old room i am no detective he remarked to jolnes as he raised the piece of theatre programme to his nose but it seems to me that instead of a ring having been wrapped in this paper it was one of those round peppermint drops and this piece with the address on it looks to me like the end of a seat coupon no row c left aisle shamrock jolnes had a far away look in his eyes i think you would do well to consult juggins said he who is juggins asked meeks he is the leader said jolnes of a new modern school of detectives their methods are different from ours but it is said that juggins has solved some extremely puzzling cases i will take you to him they found the greater juggins in his office he was a small man with light hair deeply absorbed in reading one of the bourgeois works of nathaniel hawthorne the two great detectives of different schools shook hands with ceremony and meeks was introduced state the facts said juggins going on with his reading when meeks ceased the greater one closed his book and said do i understand that your sister is fifty two years of age with a large mole on the side of her nose and that she is a very poor widow making a scanty living by scrubbing and with a very homely face and figure that describes her exactly admitted meeks juggins rose and put on his hat in fifteen minutes he said i will return bringing you her present address shamrock jolnes turned pale but forced a smile within the specified time juggins returned and consulted a little slip of paper held in his hand your sister mary snyder he announced calmly will be found at no chilton street she is living in the back hall bedroom five flights up the house is only four blocks from here he continued addressing meeks suppose you go and verify the statement and then return here mr jolnes will await you i dare say meeks hurried away in twenty minutes he was back again with a beaming face she is there and well he cried name your fee two dollars said juggins when meeks had settled his bill and departed shamrock jolnes stood with his hat in his hand before juggins if it would not be asking too much he stammered if you would favour me so far would you object to certainly not said juggins pleasantly i will tell you how i did it you remember the description of mrs snyder did you ever know a woman like that who wasn t paying weekly instalments on an enlarged crayon portrait of herself the biggest factory of that kind in the country is just around the corner i went there and got her address off the books that s all witches loaves miss martha meacham kept the little bakery on the corner the one where you go up three steps and the bell tinkles when you open the door miss martha was forty her bank book showed a credit of two thousand dollars and she possessed two false teeth and a sympathetic heart many people have married whose chances to do so were much inferior to miss martha s two or three times a week a customer came in in whom she began to take an interest he was a middle aged man wearing spectacles and a brown beard trimmed to a careful point he spoke english with a strong german accent his clothes were worn and darned in places and wrinkled and baggy in others but he looked neat and had very good manners he always bought two loaves of stale bread fresh bread was five cents a loaf stale ones were two for five never did he call for anything but stale bread once miss martha saw a red and brown stain on his fingers she was sure then that he was an artist and very poor no doubt he lived in a garret where he painted pictures and ate stale bread and thought of the good things to eat in miss martha s bakery often when miss martha sat down to her chops and light rolls and jam and tea she would sigh and wish that the gentle mannered artist might share her tasty meal instead of eating his dry crust in that draughty attic miss martha s heart as you have been told was a sympathetic one in order to test her theory as to his occupation she brought from her room one day a painting that she had bought at a sale and set it against the shelves behind the bread counter it was a venetian scene a splendid marble palazzio so it said on the picture stood in the foreground or rather forewater for the rest there were gondolas with the lady trailing her hand in the water clouds sky and chiaro oscuro in plenty no artist could fail to notice it two days afterward the customer came in two loafs of stale bread if you blease you haf here a fine bicture madame he said while she was wrapping up the bread yes says miss martha reveling in her own cunning i do so admire art and no it would not do to say artists thus early and paintings she substituted you think it is a good picture der balance said the customer is not in good drawing der bairspective of it is not true goot morning madame he took his bread bowed and hurried out yes he must be an artist miss martha took the picture back to her room how gentle and kindly his eyes shone behind his spectacles what a broad brow he had to be able to judge perspective at a glance and to live on stale bread but genius often has to struggle before it is recognized what a thing it would be for art and perspective if genius were backed by two thousand dollars in bank a bakery and a sympathetic heart to but these were day dreams miss martha often now when he came he would chat for a while across the showcase he seemed to crave miss martha s cheerful words he kept on buying stale bread never a cake never a pie never one of her delicious sally lunns she thought he began to look thinner and discouraged her heart ached to add something good to eat to his meagre purchase but her courage failed at the act she did not dare affront him she knew the pride of artists miss martha took to wearing her blue dotted silk waist behind the counter in the back room she cooked a mysterious compound of quince seeds and borax ever so many people use it for the complexion one day the customer came in as usual laid his nickel on the showcase and called for his stale loaves while miss martha was reaching for them there was a great tooting and clanging and a fire engine came lumbering past the customer hurried to the door to look as any one will suddenly inspired miss martha seized the opportunity on the bottom shelf behind the counter was a pound of fresh butter that the dairyman had left ten minutes before with a bread knife miss martha made a deep slash in each of the stale loaves inserted a generous quantity of butter and pressed the loaves tight again when the customer turned once more she was tying the paper around them when he had gone after an unusually pleasant little chat miss martha smiled to herself but not without a slight fluttering of the heart had she been too bold would he take offense but surely not there was no language of edibles butter was no emblem of unmaidenly forwardness for a long time that day her mind dwelt on the subject she imagined the scene when he should discover her little deception he would lay down his brushes and palette there would stand his easel with the picture he was painting in which the perspective was beyond criticism he would prepare for his luncheon of dry bread and water he would slice into a loaf ah miss martha blushed would he think of the hand that placed it there as he ate would he the front door bell jangled viciously somebody was coming in making a great deal of noise miss martha hurried to the front two men were there one was a young man smoking a pipe a man she had never seen before the other was her artist his face was very red his hat was on the back of his head his hair was wildly rumpled he clinched his two fists and shook them ferociously at miss martha at miss martha dummkopf he shouted with extreme loudness and then tausendonfer or something like it in german the young man tried to draw him away i vill not go he said angrily else i shall told her he made a bass drum of miss martha s counter you haf shpoilt me he cried his blue eyes blazing behind his spectacles i vill tell you you vas von meddingsome old cat miss martha leaned weakly against the shelves and laid one hand on her blue dotted silk waist the young man took the other by the collar come on he said you ve said enough he dragged the angry one out at the door to the sidewalk and then came back guess you ought to be told ma am he said what the row is about that s blumberger he s an architectural draftsman i work in the same office with him he s been working hard for three months drawing a plan for a new city hall it was a prize competition he finished inking the lines yesterday you know a draftsman always makes his drawing in pencil first when it s done he rubs out the pencil lines with handfuls of stale bread crumbs that s better than india rubber blumberger s been buying the bread here well to day well you know ma am that butter isn t well blumberger s plan isn t good for anything now except to cut up into railroad sandwiches miss martha went into the back room she took off the blue dotted silk waist and put on the old brown serge she used to wear then she poured the quince seed and borax mixture out of the window into the ash can the pride of the cities said mr kipling the cities are full of pride challenging each to each even so new york was empty two hundred thousand of its people were away for the summer three million eight hundred thousand remained as caretakers and to pay the bills of the absentees but the two hundred thousand are an expensive lot the new yorker sat at a roof garden table ingesting solace through a straw his panama lay upon a chair the july audience was scattered among vacant seats as widely as outfielders when the champion batter steps to the plate vaudeville happened at intervals the breeze was cool from the bay around and above everywhere except on the stage were stars glimpses were to be had of waiters always disappearing like startled chamois prudent visitors who had ordered refreshments by phone in the morning were now being served the new yorker was aware of certain drawbacks to his comfort but content beamed softly from his rimless eyeglasses his family was out of town the drinks were warm the ballet was suffering from lack of both tune and talcum but his family would not return until september then up into the garden stumbled the man from topaz city nevada the gloom of the solitary sightseer enwrapped him bereft of joy through loneliness he stalked with a widower s face through the halls of pleasure thirst for human companionship possessed him as he panted in the metropolitan draught straight to the new yorker s table he steered the new yorker disarmed and made reckless by the lawless atmosphere of a roof garden decided upon utter abandonment of his life s traditions he resolved to shatter with one rash dare devil impulsive hair brained act the conventions that had hitherto been woven into his existence carrying out this radical and precipitous inspiration he nodded slightly to the stranger as he drew nearer the table the next moment found the man from topaz city in the list of the new yorker s closest friends he took a chair at the table he gathered two others for his feet he tossed his broad brimmed hat upon a fourth and told his life s history to his new found pard the new yorker warmed a little as an apartment house furnace warms when the strawberry season begins a waiter who came within hail in an unguarded moment was captured and paroled on an errand to the doctor wiley experimental station the ballet was now in the midst of a musical vagary and danced upon the stage programmed as bolivian peasants clothed in some portions of its anatomy as norwegian fisher maidens in others as ladies in waiting of marie antoinette historically denuded in other portions so as to represent sea nymphs and presenting the tout ensemble of a social club of central park west housemaids at a fish fry been in the city long inquired the new yorker getting ready the exact tip against the waiter s coming with large change from the bill me said the man from topaz city four days never in topaz city was you i said the new yorker i was never farther west than eighth avenue i had a brother who died on ninth but i met the cortege at eighth there was a bunch of violets on the hearse and the undertaker mentioned the incident to avoid mistake i cannot say that i am familiar with the west topaz city said the man who occupied four chairs is one of the finest towns in the world i presume that you have seen the sights of the metropolis said the new yorker four days is not a sufficient length of time in which to view even our most salient points of interest but one can possibly form a general impression our architectural supremacy is what generally strikes visitors to our city most forcibly of course you have seen our flatiron building it is considered saw it said the man from topaz city but you ought to come out our way it s mountainous you know and the ladies all wear short skirts for climbing and excuse me said the new yorker but that isn t exactly the point new york must be a wonderful revelation to a visitor from the west now as to our hotels say said the man from topaz city that reminds me there were sixteen stage robbers shot last year within twenty miles of i was speaking of hotels said the new yorker we lead europe in that respect and as far as our leisure class is concerned we are far oh i don t know interrupted the man from topaz city there were twelve tramps in our jail when i left home i guess new york isn t so beg pardon you seem to misapprehend the idea of course you visited the stock exchange and wall street where the oh yes said the man from topaz city as he lighted a pennsylvania stogie and i want to tell you chat we ve got the finest town marshal west of the rockies bill rainer he took in five pickpockets out of the crowd when red nose thompson laid the cornerstone of his new saloon topaz city don t allow have another rhine wine and seltzer suggested the new yorker i ve never been west as i said but there can t be any place out there to compare with new york as to the claims of chicago i one man said the topazite one man only has been murdered and robbed in topaz city in the last three oh i know what chicago is interposed the new yorker have you been up fifth avenue to see the magnificent residences of our mil seen em all you ought to know reub stegall the assessor of topaz when old man tilbury that owns the only two story house in town tried to swear his taxes from down to reub buckled on his forty five and went down to see yes yes but speaking of our great city one of its greatest features is our superb police department there is no body of men in the world that can equal it for that waiter gets around like a langley flying machine remarked the man from topaz city thirstily we ve got men in our town too worth there s old bill withers and colonel metcalf and have you seen broadway at night asked the new yorker courteously there are few streets in the world that can compare with it when the electrics are shining and the pavements are alive with two hurrying streams of elegantly clothed men and beautiful women attired in the costliest costumes that wind in and out in a close maze of expensively never knew but one case in topaz city said the man from the west jim bailey our mayor had his watch and chain and in cash taken from his pocket while that s another matter said the new yorker while you are in our city you should avail yourself of every opportunity to see its wonders our rapid transit system if you was out in topaz broke in the man from there i could show you a whole cemetery full of people that got killed accidentally talking about mangling folks up why when berry rogers turned loose that old double barrelled shot gun of his loaded with slugs at anybody here waiter called the new yorker two more of the same it is acknowledged by every one that our city is the centre of art and literature and learning take for instance our after dinner speakers where else in the country would you find such wit and eloquence as emanate from depew and ford and if you take the papers interrupted the westerner you must have read of pete webster s daughter the websters live two blocks north of the court house in topaz city miss tillie webster she slept forty days and nights without waking up the doctors said that pass the matches please said the new yorker have you observed the expedition with which new buildings are being run up in new york improved inventions in steel framework and i noticed said the nevadian that the statistics of topaz city showed only one carpenter crushed by falling timbers last year and he was caught in a cyclone they abuse our sky line continued the new yorker and it is likely that we are not yet artistic in the construction of our buildings but i can safely assert that we lead in pictorial and decorative art in some of our houses can be found masterpieces in the way of paintings and sculpture one who has the entree to our best galleries will find back up exclaimed the man from topaz city there was a game last month in our town in which changed hands on a pair of ta romt tara went the orchestra the stage curtain blushing pink at the name asbestos inscribed upon it came down with a slow midsummer movement the audience trickled leisurely down the elevator and stairs on the sidewalk below the new yorker and the man from topaz city shook hands with alcoholic gravity the elevated crashed raucously surface cars hummed and clanged cabmen swore newsboys shrieked wheels clattered ear piercingly the new yorker conceived a happy thought with which he aspired to clinch the pre eminence of his city you must admit said he that in the way of noise new york is far ahead of any other back to the everglades said the man from topaz city in when sousa s band and the repeating candidate were in our town you couldn t the rattle of an express wagon drowned the rest of the words holding up a train note the man who told me these things was for several years an outlaw in the southwest and a follower of the pursuit he so frankly describes his description of the modus operandi should prove interesting his counsel of value to the potential passenger in some future hold up while his estimate of the pleasures of train robbing will hardly induce any one to adopt it as a profession i give the story in almost exactly his own words o h most people would say if their opinion was asked for that holding up a train would be a hard job well it isn t it s easy i have contributed some to the uneasiness of railroads and the insomnia of express companies and the most trouble i ever had about a hold up was in being swindled by unscrupulous people while spending the money i got the danger wasn t anything to speak of and we didn t mind the trouble one man has come pretty near robbing a train by himself two have succeeded a few times three can do it if they are hustlers but five is about the right number the time to do it and the place depend upon several things the first stick up i was ever in happened in maybe the way i got into it will explain how most train robbers start in the business five out of six western outlaws are just cowboys out of a job and gone wrong the sixth is a tough from the east who dresses up like a bad man and plays some low down trick that gives the boys a bad name wire fences and nesters made five of them a bad heart made the sixth jim s and i were working on the ranch in colorado the nesters had the cowman on t he go they had taken up the land and elected officers who were hard to get along with jim and i rode into la junta one day going south from a round up we were having a little fun without malice toward any body when a farmer administration cut in and tried to harvest us jim shot a deputy marshal and i kind of corroborated his side of the argument we skirmished up and down the main street the boomers having bad luck all the time after a while we leaned forward and shoved for the ranch down on the ceriso we were riding a couple of horses that couldn t fly but they could catch birds a few days after that a gang of the la junta boomers came to the ranch and wanted us to go back with them naturally we declined we had the house on them and before we were done refusing that old dobe was plumb full of lead when dark came we fagged em a batch of bullets and shoved out the back door for the rocks they sure smoked us as we went we had to drift which we did and rounded up down in oklahoma well there wasn t anything we could get there and being mighty hard up we decided to transact a little business with the railroads jim and i joined forces with tom and ike moore two brothers who had plenty of sand they were willing to convert into dust i can call their names for both of them are dead tom was shot while robbing a bank in arkansas ike was killed during the more dangerous pastime of attending a dance in the creek nation we selected a place on the santa fe where there was a bridge across a deep creek surrounded by heavy timber all passenger trains took water at the tank close to one end of the bridge it was a quiet place the nearest house being five miles away the day before it happened we rested our horses and made medicine as to how we should get about it our plans were not at all elaborate as none of us had ever engaged in a hold up before the santa fe flyer was due at the tank at p m at eleven tom and i lay down on one side of the track and jim and ike took the other as the train rolled up the headlight flashing far down the track and the steam hissing from the engine i turned weak all over i would have worked a whole year on the ranch for nothing to have been out of that affair right then some of the nerviest men in the business have told me that they felt the same way the first time the engine had hardly stopped when i jumped on the running board on one side while jim mounted the other as soon as the engineer and fireman saw our guns they threw up their hands without being told and begged us not to shoot saying they would do anything we wanted them to hit the ground i ordered and they both jumped off we drove them before us down the side of the train while this was happening tom and ike had been blazing away one on each side of the train yelling like apaches so as to keep the passengers herded in the cars some fellow stuck a little twenty two calibre out one of the coach windows and fired it straight up in the air i let drive and smashed the glass just over his head that settled everything like resistance from that direction by this time all my nervousness was gone i felt a kind of pleasant excitement as if i were at a dance or a frolic of some sort the lights were all out in the coaches and as tom and ike gradually quit firing and yelling it got to be almost as still as a graveyard i remember hearing a little bird chirping in a bush at the side of the track as if it were complaining at being waked up i made the fireman get a lantern and then i went to the express car and yelled to the messenger to open up or get perforated he slid the door back and stood in it with his hands up jump overboard son i said and he hit the dirt like a lump of lead there were two safes in the car a big one and a little one by the way i first located the messenger s arsenal a double barrelled shot gun with buckshot cartridges and a thirty eight in a drawer i drew the cartridges from the shot gun pocketed the pistol and called the messenger inside i shoved my gun against his nose and put him to work he couldn t open the big safe but he did the little one there was only nine hundred dollars in it that was mighty small winnings for our trouble so we decided to go through the passengers we took our prisoners to the smoking car and from there sent the engineer through the train to light up the coaches beginning with the first one we placed a man at each door and ordered the passengers to stand between the seats with their hands up if you want to find out what cowards the majority of men are all you have to do is rob a passenger train i don t mean because they don t resist i ll tell you later on why they can t do that but it makes a man feel sorry for them the way they lose their heads big burly drummers and farmers and ex soldiers and high collared dudes and sports that a few moments before were filling the car with noise and bragging get so scared that their ears flop there were very few people in the day coaches at that time of night so we made a slim haul until we got to the sleeper the pullman conductor met me at one door while jim was going round to the other one he very politely informed me that i could not go into that car as it did not belong to the railroad company and besides the passengers had already been greatly disturbed by the shouting and firing never in all my life have i met with a finer instance of official dignity and reliance upon the power of mr pull man s great name i jabbed my six shooter so hard against mr conductor s front that i afterward found one of his vest buttons so firmly wedged in the end of the barrel that i had to shoot it out he just shut up like a weak springed knife and rolled down the car steps i opened the door of the sleeper and stepped inside a big fat old man came wabbling up to me puffing and blowing he had one coat sleeve on and was trying to put his vest on over that i don t know who he thought i was young man young man says he you must keep cool and not get excited above everything keep cool i can t says i excitement s just eating me up and then i let out a yell and turned loose my forty five through the skylight that old man tried to dive into one of the lower berths but a screech came out of it and a bare foot that took him in the bread basket and landed him on the floor i saw jim coming in the other door and i hollered for everybody to climb out and line up they commenced to scramble down and for a while we had a three ringed circus the men looked as frightened and tame as a lot of rabbits in a deep snow they had on on an average about a quarter of a suit of clothes and one shoe apiece one chap was sitting on the floor of the aisle looking as if he were working a hard sum in arithmetic he was trying very solemn to pull a lady s number two shoe on his number nine foot the ladies didn t stop to dress they were so curious to see a real live train robber bless em that they just wrapped blankets and sheets around themselves and came out squeaky and fidgety looking they always show more curiosity and sand than the men do we got them all lined up and pretty quiet and i went through the bunch i found very little on them i mean in the way of valuables one man in the line was a sight he was one of those big overgrown solemn snoozers that sit on the platform at lectures and look wise before crawling out he had managed to put on his long frock tailed coat and his high silk hat the rest of him was nothing but pajamas and bunions when i dug into that prince albert i expected to drag out at least a block of gold mine stock or an armful of government bonds but all i found was a little boy s french harp about four inches long what it was there for i don t know i felt a little mad because he had fooled me so i stuck the harp up against his mouth if you can t pay play i says i can t play says he then learn right off quick says i letting him smell the end of my gun barrel he caught hold of the harp turned red as a beet and commenced to blow he blew a dinky little tune i remembered hearing when i was a kid prettiest little gal in the country oh mammy and daddy told me so i made him keep on playing it all the time we were in the car now and then he d get weak and off the key and i d turn my gun on him and ask what was the matter with that little gal and whether he had any intention of going back on her which would make him start up again like sixty i think that old boy standing there in his silk hat and bare feet playing his little french harp was the funniest sight i ever saw one little red headed woman in the line broke out laughing at him you could have heard her in the next car then jim held them steady while i searched the berths i grappled around in those beds and filled a pillow case with the strangest assortment of stuff you ever saw now and then i d come across a little pop gun pistol just about right for plugging teeth with which i d throw out the window when i finished with the collection i dumped the pillow case load in the middle of the aisle there were a good many watches bracelets rings and pocket books with a sprinkling of false teeth whiskey flasks fa ce powder boxes chocolate caramels and heads of hair of various colours and lengths there were also about a dozen ladies stockings into which jewellery watches and rolls of bills had been stuffed and then wadded up tight and stuck under the mattresses i offered to return what i called the scalps saying that we were not indians on the war path but none of the ladies seemed to know to whom the hair belonged one of the women and a good looker she was wrapped in a striped blanket saw me pick up one of the stockings that was pretty chunky and heavy about the toe and she snapped out that s mine sir you re not in the business of robbing women are you now as this was our first hold up we hadn t agreed upon any code of ethics so i hardly knew what to answer but anyway i replied well not as a specialty if this contains your personal property you can have it back it just does she declared eagerly and reached out her hand for it you ll excuse my taking a look at the contents i said holding the stocking up by the toe out dumped a big gent s gold watch worth two hundred a gent s leather pocket book that we afterward found to contain six hundred dollars a calibre revolver and the only thing of the lot that could have been a lady s personal property was a silver bracelet worth about fifty cents i said madame here s your property and handed her the bracelet now i went on how can you expect us to act square with you when you try to deceive us in this manner i m surprised at such conduct the young woman flushed up as if she had been caught doing something dishonest some other woman down the line called out the mean thing i never knew whether she meant the other lady or me when we finished our job we ordered everybody back to bed told em good night very politely at the door and left we rode forty miles before daylight and then divided the stuff each one of us got in money we lumped the jewellery around then we scattered each man for himself that was my first train robbery and it was about as easily done as any of the ones that followed but that was the last and only time i ever went through the passengers i don t like that part of the business afterward i stuck strictly to the express car during the next eight years i handled a good deal of money the best haul i made was just seven years after the first one we found out about a train that was going to bring out a lot of money to pay off the soldiers at a government post we stuck that train up in broad daylight five of us lay in the sand hills near a little station ten soldiers were guarding the money on the train but they might just as well have been at home on a furlough we didn t even allow them to stick their heads out the windows to see the fun we had no trouble at all in getting the money which was all in gold of course a big howl was raised at the time about the robbery it was government stuff and the government got sarcastic and wanted to know what the convoy of soldiers went along for the only excuse given was that nobody was expecting an attack among those bare sand hills in daytime i don t know what the government thought about the excuse but i know that it was a good one the surprise that is the keynote of the train robbing business the papers published all k inds of stories about the loss finally agreeing that it was between nine thousand and ten thousand dollars the government sawed wood here are the correct figures printed for the first time forty eight thousand dollars if anybody will take the trouble to look over uncle sam s private accounts for that little debit to profit and loss he will find that i am right to a cent by that time we were expert enough to know what to do we rode due west twenty miles making a trail that a broadway policeman could have followed and then we doubled back hiding our tracks on the second night after the hold up while posses were scouring the country in every direction jim and i were eating supper in the second story of a friend s house in the town where the alarm started from our friend pointed out to us in an office across the street a printing press at work striking off handbills offering a reward for our capture i have been asked what we do with the money we get well i never could account for a tenth part of it after it was spent it goes fast and freely an outlaw has to have a good many friends a highly respected citizen may and often does get along with very few but a man on the dodge has got to have sidekickers with angry posses and reward hungry officers cutting out a hot trail for him he must have a few places scattered about the country where he can stop and feed himself and his horse and get a few hours sleep without having to keep both eyes open when he makes a haul he feels like dropping some of the coin with these friends and he does it liberally sometimes i have at the end of a hasty visit at one of these havens of refuge flung a handful of gold and bills into the laps of the kids playing on the floor without knowing whether my contribution was a hundred dollars or a thousand when old timers make a big haul they generally go far away to one of the big cities to spend their money green hands however successful a hold up they make nearly always give themselves away by showing too much money near the place where they got it i was in a job in where we got twenty thousand dollars we followed our favourite plan for a get away that is doubled on our trail and laid low for a time near the scene of the train s bad luck one morning i picked up a newspaper and read an article with big headlines stating that the marshal with eight deputies and a posse of thirty armed citizens had the train robbers surrounded in a mesquite thicket on the cimarron and that it was a question of only a few hours when they would be dead men or prisoners while i was reading that article i was sitting at breakfast in one of the most elegant private residences in washington city with a flunky in knee pants standing behind my chair jim was sitting across the table talking to his half uncle a retired naval officer whose name you have often seen in the accounts of doings in the capital we had gone there and bought rattling outfits of good clothes and were resting from our labours among the nabobs we must have been killed in that mesquite thicket for i can make an affidavit that we didn t surrender now i propose to tell why it is easy to hold up a train and then why no one should ever do it in the first place the attacking party has all the advantage that is of course supposing that they are old timers with the necessary experience and courage they have the outside and are protected by the darkness while the others are in the light hemmed into a small space and exposed the moment they show a head at a window or door to the aim of a man who is a dead shot and who won t hesitate to shoot but in my opinion the main condition that makes train robbing easy is the element of surprise in connection with the imagination of the passengers if you have ever seen a horse that has eaten loco weed you will understand what i mean when i say that the passengers get locoed that horse gets the awfullest imagination on him in the world you can t coax him to cross a little branch stream two feet wide it looks as big to him as the mississippi river that s just the way with the passenger he thinks there are a hundred men yelling and shooting outside when maybe there are only two or three and the muzzle of a forty five looks like the entrance to a tunnel the passenger is all right although he may do mean little tricks like hiding a wad of money in his shoe and forgetting to dig up until you jostle his ribs some with the end of your six shooter but there s no harm in him as to the train crew we never had any more trouble with them than if they had been so many sheep i don t mean that they are cowards i mean that they have got sense they know they re not up against a bluff it s the same way with the officers i ve seen secret service men marshals and railroad detectives fork over their change as meek as moses i saw one of the bravest marshals i ever knew hide his gun under his seat and dig up along with the rest while i was taking toll he wasn t afraid he simply knew that we had the drop on the whole outfit besides many of those officers have families and they feel that they oughtn t to take chances whereas death has no terrors for the man who holds up a train he expects to get killed some day and he generally does my advice to you if you should ever be in a hold up is to line up with the cowards and save your bravery for an occasion when it may be of some benefit to you another reason why officers are backward about mixing things with a train robber is a financial one every time there is a scrimmage and somebody gets killed the officers lose money if the train robber gets away they swear out a warrant against john doe et al and travel hundreds of miles and sign vouchers for thousands on the trail of the fugitives and the government foots the bills so with them it is a question of mileage rather than courage i will give one instance to support my statement that the surprise is the best card in playing for a hold up along in the daltons were cutting out a hot trail for the officers down in the cherokee nation those were their lucky days and they got so reckless and sandy that they used to announce before hand what job they were going to undertake once they gave it out that they were going to hold up the m k t flyer on a certain night at the station of pryor creek in indian territory that night the railroad company got fifteen deputy marshals in muscogee and put them on the train beside them they had fifty armed men hid in the depot at pryor creek when the katy flyer pulled in not a dalton showed up the next station was adair six miles away when the train reached there and the deputies were having a good time explaining what they would have done to the dalton gang if they had turned up all at once it sounded like an army firing outside the conductor and brakeman came running into the car yelling train robbers some of those deputies lit out of the door hit the ground and kept on running some of them hid their winchesters under the seats two of them made a fight and were both killed it took the daltons just ten minutes to capture the train and whip the escort in twenty minutes more they robbed the express car of twenty seven thousand dollars and made a clean get away my opinion is that those deputies would have put up a stiff fight at pryor creek where they were expecting trouble but they were taken by surprise and locoed at adair just as the daltons who knew their business expected they would i don t think i ought to close without giving some deductions from my experience of eight years on the dodge it doesn t pay to rob trains leaving out the question of right and morals which i don t think i ought to tackle there is very little to envy in the life of an outlaw after a while money ceases to have any value in his eyes he gets to looking upon the railroads and express companies as his bankers and his six shooter as a cheque book good for any amount he throws away money right and left most of the time he is on the jump riding day and night and he lives so hard between times that he doesn t enjoy the taste of high life when he gets it he knows that his time is bound to come to lose his life or liberty and that the accuracy of his aim the speed of his horse and the fidelity of his sider are all that postpone the inevitable it isn t that he loses any sleep over danger from the officers of the law in all my experience i never knew officers to attack a band of outlaws unless they outnumbered them at least three to one but the outlaw carries one thought constantly in his mind and that is what makes him so sore against life more than anything else he knows where the marshals get their recruits of deputies he knows that the majority of these upholders of the law were once lawbreakers horse thieves rustlers highwaymen and outlaws like himself and that they gamed their positions and immunity by turning state s evidence by turning traitor and delivering up their comrades to imprisonment and death he knows that some day unless he is shot first his judas will set to work the trap will be laid and he will be the surprised instead of a surpriser at a stick up that is why the man who holds up trains picks his company with a thousand times the care with which a careful girl chooses a sweetheart that is why he raises himself from his blanket of nights and listens to the tread of every horse s hoofs on the distant road that is why he broods suspiciously for days upon a jesting remark or an unusual movement of a tried comrade or the broken mutterings of his closest friend sleeping by his side and it is one of the reasons why the train robbing profession is not so pleasant a one as either of its collateral branches politics or cornering the market ulysses and the dogman do you know the time of the dogmen when the forefinger of twilight begins to smudge the clear drawn lines of the big city there is inaugurated an hour devoted to one of the most melancholy sights of urban life out from the towering flat crags and apartment peaks of the cliff dwellers of new york steals an army of beings that were once men even yet they go upright upon two limbs and retain human form and speech but you will observe that they are behind animals in progress each of these beings follows a dog to which he is fastened by an artificial ligament these men are all victims to circe not willingly do they become flunkeys to fido bell boys to bull terriers and toddlers after towzer modern circe instead of turning them into animals has kindly left the difference of a six foot leash between them every one of those dogmen has been either cajoled bribed or commanded by his own particular circe to take the dear household pet out for an airing by their faces and manner you can tell that the dogmen are bound in a hopeless enchantment never will there come even a dog catcher ulysses to remove the spell the faces of some are stonily set they are past the commiseration the curiosity or the jeers of their fellow beings years of matrimony of continuous compulsory canine constitutionals have made them callous they unwind their beasts from lamp posts or the ensnared legs of profane pedestrians with the stolidity of mandarins manipulating the strings of their kites others more recently reduced to the ranks of rover s retinue take their medicine sulkily and fiercely they play the dog on the end of their line with the pleasure felt by the girl out fishing when she catches a sea robin on her hook they glare at you threateningly if you look at them as if it would be their delight to let slip the dogs of war these are half mutinous dogmen not quite circe ized and you will do well not to kick their charges should they sniff around your ankles others of the tribe do not seem to feel so keenly they are mostly unfresh youths with gold caps and drooping cigarettes who do not harmonize with their dogs the animals they attend wear satin bows in their collars and the young men steer them so assiduously that you are tempted to the theory that some personal advantage contingent upon satisfactory service waits upon the execution of their duties the dogs thus personally conducted are of many varieties but they are one in fatness in pampered diseased vileness of temper in insolent snarling capriciousness of behaviour they tug at the leash fractiously they make leisurely nasal inventory of every door step railing and post they sit down to rest when they choose they wheeze like the winner of a third avenue beefsteak eating contest they blunder clumsily into open cellars and coal holes they lead the dogmen a merry dance these unfortunate dry nurses of dogdom the cur cuddlers mongrel managers spitz stalkers poodle pullers skye scrapers dachshund dandlers terrier trailers and pomeranian pushers of the cliff dwelling circes follow their charges meekly the doggies neither fear nor respect them masters of the house these men whom they hold in leash may be but they are not masters of them from cosey corner to fire escape from divan to dumbwaiter doggy s snarl easily drives this two legged being who is commissioned to walk at the other end of his string during his outing one twilight the dogmen came forth as usual at their circes pleading guerdon or crack of the whip one among them was a strong man apparently of too solid virtues for this airy vocation his expression was melancholic his manner depressed he was leashed to a vile white dog loathsomely fat fiendishly ill natured gloatingly intractable toward his despised conductor at a corner nearest to his apartment house the dogman turned down a side street hoping for fewer witnesses to his ignominy the surfeited beast waddled before him panting with spleen and the labour of motion suddenly the dog stopped a tall brown long coated wide brimmed man stood like a colossus blocking the sidewalk and declaring well i m a son of a gun jim berry breathed the dogman with exclamation points in his voice sam telfair cried wide brim again you ding basted old willy walloo give us your hoof their hands clasped in the brief tight greeting of the west that is death to the hand shake

ferry with you said the dogman the dog had bound a leg each of jim and the chair together and had sunk into a comatose slumber jim stumbled and the leash was slightly wrenched the shrieks of the awakened beast rang for a block around if that s your dog said jim when they were on the street again what s to hinder you from running that habeas corpus you ve got around his neck over a limb and walking off and forgetting him i d never dare to said the dogman awed at the bold proposition he sleeps in the bed i sleep on a lounge he runs howling to marcella if i look at him some night jim i m

telfair began jim hush said the dogman here s another cafe they lined up at the bar the dog fell asleep at their feet whiskey said jim make it two said the dogman i thought about you said jim when i bought that wild land i wished you was out there to help me with the stock last tuesday said the dogman he bit me on the ankle because i asked for cream in my coffee he always gets the cream you d

side of it you pass through the kitchen to get to the bedroom said the dogman and you pass through the parlour to get to the bath room and you back out through the dining room to get into the bedroom so you can turn around and leave by the kitchen and he snores and barks in his sleep and i have to smoke in the park on account of his asthma don t missis telfair began jim oh shut up said the dogman what is it this time whiskey said jim make it two said the dogman well i ll be racking along down toward the ferry said the other come on there you mangy turtle backed snake headed bench legged ton and a half of soap grease shouted the dogman with a new note in his voice and a new hand on the leash the dog scrambled after them with an angry whine at such unusual language from his guardian at the foot of twenty third street the dogman led the way through swinging doors last chance said he speak up whiskey said jim make it two said the dogman i don t know said the ranchman where i ll find the man i want to take charge of the little powder outfit i want somebody i know something about finest stretch of prairie and timber you ever squinted your eye over sam now if you was speaking of hydrophobia said the dogman the other night he chewed a piece out of my leg because i knocked a fly off of marcella s arm it ought to be cauterized says marcella and i was thinking so myself i telephones for the doctor and when he comes marcella says to me help me hold the poor dear while the doctor fixes his mouth oh i hope he got no virus on any of his toofies when he bit you now what do you think of that does missis telfair began jim oh drop it said the dogman come again whiskey said jim make it two said the dogman they walked on to the ferry the ranchman stepped to the ticket window suddenly the swift landing of three or four heavy kicks was heard the air was rent by piercing canine shrieks and a pained outraged lubberly bow legged pudding of a dog ran frenziedly up the street alone ticket to denver said jim make it two shouted the ex dogman reaching for his inside pocket the champion of the weather if you should speak of the kiowa reservation to the average new yorker he probably wouldn t know whether you were referring to a new political dodge at albany or a leitmotif from parsifal but out in the kiowa reservation advices have been received concerning the existence of new york a party of us were on a hunting trip in the reservation bud kingsbury our guide philosopher and friend was broiling antelope steaks in camp one night one of the party a pinkish haired young man in a correct hunting costume sauntered over to the fire to light a cigarette and remarked carelessly to bud nice night why yes said bud as nice as any night could be that ain t received the broadway stamp of approval now the young man was from new york but the rest of us wondered how bud guessed it so when the steaks were done we besought him to lay bare his system of ratiocination and as bud was something of a territorial talking machine he made oration as follows how did i know he was from new york well i figured it out as soon as he sprung them two words on me i was in new york myself a couple of years ago and i noticed some of the earmarks and hoof tracks of the rancho manhattan found new york rather different from the panhandle didn t you bud asked one of the hunters can t say that i did answered bud anyways not more than some the main trail in that town which they call broadway is plenty travelled but they re about the same brand of bipeds that tramp around in cheyenne and amarillo at first i was sort of rattled by the crowds but i soon says to myself here now bud they re just plain folks like you and geronimo and grover cleveland and the watson boys so don t get all flustered up with consternation under your saddle blanket and then i feels calm and peaceful like i was back in the nation again at a ghost dance or a green corn pow wow i d been saving up for a year to give this new york a whirl i knew a man named summers that lived there but i couldn t find him so i played a lone hand at enjoying the intoxicating pleasures of the corn fed metropolis for a while i was so frivolous and locoed by the electric lights and the noises of the phonographs and the second story railroads that i forgot one of the crying needs of my western system of natural requirements i never was no hand to deny myself the pleasures of sociable vocal intercourse with friends and strangers out in the territories when i meet a man i never saw before inside of nine minutes i know his income religion size of collar and his wife s temper and how much he pays for clothes al imony and chewing tobacco it s a gift with me not to be penurious with my conversation but this here new york was inaugurated on the idea of abstemiousness in regard to the parts of speech at the end of three weeks nobody in the city had fired even a blank syllable in my direction except the waiter in the grub emporium where i fed and as his outpourings of syntax wasn t nothing but plagiarisms from the bill of fare he never satisfied my yearnings which was to have somebody hit if i stood next to a man at a bar he d edge off and give a baldwin ziegler look as if he suspected me of having the north pole concealed on my person i began to wish that i d gone to abilene or waco for my paseado for the mayor of them places will drink with you and the first citizen you meet will tell you his middle name and ask you to take a chance in a raffle for a music box well one day when i was particular hankering for to be gregarious with something more loquacious than a lamp post a fellow in a caffy says to me says he nice day he was a kind of a manager of the place and i reckon he d seen me in there a good many times he had a face like a fish and an eye like judas but i got up and put one arm around his neck pardner i says sure it s a nice day you re the first gentleman in all new york to observe that the intricacies of human speech might not be altogether wasted on william kingsbury but don t you think says i that twas a little cool early in the morning and ain t there a feeling of rain in the air to night but along about noon it sure was gallupsious weather how s all up to the house you doing right well with the caffy now well sir that galoot just turns his back and walks off stiff without a word after all my trying to be agreeable i didn t know what to make of it that night i finds a note from summers who d been away from town giving the address of his camp i goes up to his house and has a good old time talk with his folks and i tells summers about the actions of this coyote in the caffy and desires interpretation oh says summers he wasn t intending to strike up a conversation with you that s just the new york style he d seen you was a regular customer and he spoke a word or two just to show you he appreciated your custom you oughtn t to have followed it up that s about as far as we care to go with a stranger a word or so about the weather may be ventured but we don t generally make it the basis of an acquaintance billy says i the weather and its ramifications is a solemn subject with me meteorology is one of my sore points no man can open up the question of temperature or humidity or the glad sunshine with me and then turn tail on it without its leading to a falling barometer i m going down to see that man again and give him a lesson in the art of continuous conversation you say new york etiquette allows him two words and no answer well he s going to turn himself into a weather bureau and finish what he begun with me besides indulging in neighbourly remarks on other subjects summers talked agin it but i was irritated some and i went on the street car back to that caffy the same fellow was there yet walking round in a sort of back corral where there was tables and chairs a few people was sitting around having drinks and sneering at one another i called that man to one side and herded him into a corner i unbuttoned enough to show him a thirty eight i carried stuck under my vest pardner i says a brief space ago i was in here and you seized the opportunity to say it was a nice day when i attempted to corroborate your weather signal you turned your back and walked off now says i you frog hearted language shy stiff necked cross between a spitzbergen sea cook and a muzzled oyster you resume where you left off in your discourse on the weather the fellow looks at me and tries to grin but he sees i don t and he comes around serious well says he eyeing the handle of my gun it was rather a nice day some warmish though particulars you mealy mouthed snoozer i says let s have the specifications expatiate fill in the outlines when you start anything with me in short hand it s bound to turn out a storm signal looked like rain yesterday says the man but it cleared off fine in the forenoon i hear the farmers are needing rain right badly up state that s the kind of a canter says i shake the new york dust off your hoofs and be a real agreeable kind of a centaur you broke the ice you know and we re getting better acquainted every minute seems to me i asked you about your family they re all well thanks says he we we have a new piano now you re coming it i says this cold reserve is breaking up at last that little touch about the piano almost makes us brothers what s the youngest kid s name i asks him thomas says he he s just getting well from the measles i feel like i d known you always says i now there was just one more are you doing right well with the caffy now pretty well he says i m putting away a little money glad to hear it says i now go back to your work and get civilized keep your hands off the weather unless you re ready to follow it up in a personal manner it s a subject that naturally belongs to sociability and the forming of new ties and i hate to see it handed out in small change in a town like this so the next day i rolls up my blankets and hits the trail away from new york city for many minutes after bud ceased talking we lingered around the fire and then all hands began to disperse for bed as i was unrolling my bedding i heard the pinkish haired young man saying to bud with something like anxiety in his voice as i say mr kingsbury there is something really beautiful about this night the delightful breeze and the bright stars and the clear air unite in making it wonderfully attractive yes said bud it s a nice night makes the whole world kin the burglar stepped inside the window quickly and then he took his time a burglar who respects his art always takes his time before taking anything else the house was a private residence by its boarded front door and untrimmed boston ivy the burglar knew that the mistress of it was sitting on some oceanside piazza telling a sympathetic man in a yachting cap that no one had ever understood her sensitive lonely heart he knew by the light in the third story front windows and by the lateness of the season that the master of the house had come home and would soon extinguish his light and retire for it was september of the year and of the soul in which season the house s good man comes to consider roof gardens and stenographers as vanities and to desire the return of his mate and the more durable blessings of decorum and the moral excellencies the burglar lighted a cigarette the guarded glow of the match illuminated his salient points for a moment he belonged to the third type of burglars this third type has not yet been recognized and accepted the police have made us familiar with the first and second their classification is simple the collar is the distinguishing mark when a burglar is caught who does not wear a collar he is described as a degenerate of the lowest type singularly vicious and depraved and is suspected of being the desperate criminal who stole the handcuffs out of patrolman hennessy s pocket in and walked away to escape arrest the other well known type is the burglar who wears a collar he is always referred to as a raffles in real life he is invariably a gentleman by daylight breakfasting in a dress suit and posing as a paperhanger while after dark he plies his nefarious occupation of burglary his mother is an extremely wealthy and respected resident of ocean grove and when he is conducted to his cell he asks at once for a nail file and the police gazette he always has a wife in every state in the union and fiancees in all the territories and the newspapers print his matrimonial gallery out of their stock of cuts of the ladies who were cured by only one bottle after having been given up by five doctors experiencing great relief after the first dose the burglar wore a blue sweater he was neither a raffles nor one of the chefs from hell s kitchen the police would have been baffled had they attempted to classify him they have not yet heard of the respectable unassuming burglar who is neither above nor below his station this burglar of the third class began to prowl he wore no masks dark lanterns or gum shoes he carried a calibre revolver in his pocket and he chewed peppermint gum thoughtfully the furniture of the house was swathed in its summer dust protectors the silver was far away in safe deposit vaults the burglar expected no remarkable haul his objective point was that dimly lighted room where the master of the house should be sleeping heavily after whatever solace he had sought to lighten the burden of his loneliness a touch might be made there to the extent of legitimate fair professional profits loose money a watch a jewelled stick pin nothing exorbitant or beyond rea son he had seen the window left open and had taken the chance the burglar softly opened the door of the lighted room the gas was turned low a man lay in the bed asleep on the dresser lay many things in confusion a crumpled roll of bills a watch keys three poker chips crushed cigars a pink silk hair bow and an unopened bottle of bromo seltzer for a bulwark in the morning the burglar took three steps toward the dresser the man in the bed suddenly uttered a squeaky groan and opened his eyes his right hand slid under his pillow but remained there lay still said the burglar in conversational tone burglars of the third type do not hiss the citizen in the bed looked at the round end of the burglar s pistol and lay still now hold up both your hands commanded the burglar the citizen had a little pointed brown and gray beard like that of a painless dentist he looked solid esteemed irritable and disgusted he sat up in bed and raised his right hand above his head up with the other one ordered the burglar you might be amphibious and shoot with your left you can count two can t you hurry up now can t raise the other one said the citizen with a contortion of his lineaments what s the matter with it rheumatism in the shoulder inflammatory was the inflammation has gone down the burglar stood for a moment or two holding his gun on the afflicted one he glanced at the plunder on the dresser and then with a half embarrassed air back at the man in the bed then he too made a sudden grimace don t stand there making faces snapped the citizen bad humouredly if you ve come to burgle why don t you do it there s some stuff lying around scuse me said the burglar with a grin but it just socked me one too it s good for you that rheumatism and me happens to be old pals i got it in my left arm too most anybody but me would have popped you when you wouldn t hoist that left claw of yours how long have you had it inquired the citizen four years i guess that ain t all once you ve got it it s you for a rheumatic life that s my judgment ever try rattlesnake oil asked the citizen interestedly gallons said the burglar if all the snakes i ve used the oil of was strung out in a row they d reach eight times as far as saturn and the rattles could be heard at valparaiso indiana and back some use chiselum s pills remarked the citizen fudge said the burglar took em five months no good i had some relief the year i tried finkelham s extract balm of gilead poultices and potts s pain pulverizer but i think it was the buckeye i carried in my pocket what done the trick is yours worse in the morning or at night asked the citizen night said the burglar just when i m busiest say take down that arm of yours i guess you won t say did you ever try blickerstaff s blood builder i never did does yours come in paroxysms or is it a steady pain the burglar sat down on the foot of the bed and rested his gun on his crossed knee it jumps said he it strikes me when i ain t looking for it i had to give up second story work because i got stuck sometimes half way up tell you what i don t believe the bloomin doctors know what is good for it same here i ve spent a thousand dollars without getting any relief yours swell any of mornings and when it s goin to rain great christopher me too said the citizen i can tell when a streak of humidity the size of a table cloth starts from florida on its way to new york and if i pass a theatre where there s an east lynne matinee going on the moisture starts my left arm jumping like a toothache it s undiluted hades said the burglar you re dead right said the citizen the burglar looked down at his pistol and thrust it into his pocket with an awkward attempt at ease say old man he said constrainedly ever try opodeldoc slop said the citizen angrily might as well rub on restaurant butter sure concurred the burglar it s a salve suitable for little minnie when the kitty scratches her finger i ll tell you what we re up against it i only find one thing that eases her up hey little old sanitary ameliorating lest we forget booze say this job s off scuse me get on your clothes and let s go out and have some scuse the liberty but ouch there she goes again for a week said the citizen i haven t been able to dress myself without help i m afraid thomas is in bed and climb out said the burglar i ll help you get into your duds the conventional returned as a tidal wave and flooded the citizen he stroked his brown and gray beard it s very unusual he began here s your shirt said the burglar fall out i knew a man who said omberry s ointment fixed him in two weeks so he could use both hands in tying his four in hand as they were going out the door the citizen turned and started back liked to forgot my money he explained laid it on the dresser last night the burglar caught him by the right sleeve come on he said bluffly i ask you leave it alone i ve got the price ever try witch hazel and oil of wintergreen at arms with morpheus i never could quite understand how tom hopkins came to make that blunder for he had been through a whole term at a medical college before he inherited his aunt s fortune and had been considered strong in therapeutics we had been making a call together that evening and afterward tom ran up to my rooms for a pipe and a chat before going on to his own luxurious apartments i had stepped into the other room for a moment when i heard tom sing out oh billy i m going to take about four grains of quinine if you don t mind i m feeling all blue and shivery guess i m taking cold all right i called back the bottle is on the second shelf take it in a spoonful of that elixir of eucalyptus it knocks the bitter out after i came back we sat by the fire and got our briars going in about eight minutes tom sank back into a gentle collapse i went straight to the medicine cabinet and looked you unmitigated hayseed i growled see what money will do for a man s brains there stood the morphine bottle with the stopple out just as tom had left it i routed out another young m d who roomed on the floor above and sent him for old doctor gales two squares away tom hopkins has too much money to be attended by rising young practitioners alone when gales came we put tom through as expensive a course of treatment as the resources of the profession permit after the more drastic remedies we gave him citrate of caffeine in frequent doses and strong coffee and walked him up and down the floor between two of us old gales pinched him and slapped his face and worked hard for the big check he could see in the distance the young m d from the next floor gave tom a most hearty rousing kick and then apologized to me couldn t help it he said i never kicked a millionaire before in my life i may never have another opportunity now said doctor gales after a couple of hours he ll do but keep him awake for another hour you can do that by talking to him and shaking him up occasionally when his pulse and respiration are normal then let him sleep i ll leave him with you now i was left alone with tom whom we had laid on a couch he lay very still and his eyes were half closed i began my work of keeping him awake well old man i said you ve had a narrow squeak but we ve pulled you through when you were attending lectures tom didn t any of the professors ever casually remark that m o r p h i a never spells quinia especially in four grain doses but i won t pile it up on you until you get on your feet but you ought to have been a druggist tom you re splendidly qualified to fill prescriptions tom looked at me with a faint and foolish smile b ly he murmured i feel jus like a hum n bird flyin around a jolly lot of most shpensive roses don bozzer me goin sleep now and he went to sleep in two seconds i shook him by the shoulder now tom i said severely this won t do the big doctor said you must stay awake for at least an hour open your eyes you re not entirely safe yet you know wake up tom hopkins weighs one hundred and ninety eight he gave me another somnolent grin and fell into deeper slumber i would have made him move about but i might as well have tried to make cleopatra s needle waltz around the room with me tom s breathing became stertorous and that in connection with morphia poisoning means danger then i began to think i could not rouse his body i must strive to excite his mind make him angry was an idea that suggested itself good i thought but how there was not a joint in tom s armour dear old fellow he was good nature itself and a gallant gentleman fine and true and clean as sunlight he came from somewhere down south where they still have ideals and a code new york had charmed but had not spoiled him he had that old fashioned chivalrous reverence for women that eur eka there was my idea i worked the thing up for a minute or two in my imagination i chuckled to myself at the thought of springing a thing like that on old tom hopkins then i took him by the shoulder and shook him till his ears flopped he opened his eyes lazily i assumed an expression of scorn and contempt and pointed my finger within two inches of his nose listen to me hopkins i said in cutting and distinct tones you and i have been good friends but i want you to understand that in the future my doors are closed against any man who acts as much like a scoundrel as you have tom looked the least bit interested what s the matter billy he muttered composedly don t your clothes fit you if i were in your place i went on which thank god i am not i think i would be afraid to close my eyes how about that girl you left waiting for you down among those lonesome southern pines the girl that you ve forgotten since you came into your confounded money oh i know what i m talking about while you were a poor medical student she was good enough for you but now since you are a millionaire it s different i wonder what she thinks of the performances of that peculiar class of people which she has been taught to worship the southern gentlemen i m sorry hopkins that i was forced to speak about these matters but you ve covered it up so well and played your part so nicely that i would have sworn you were above such unmanly tricks poor tom i could scarcely keep from laughing outright to see him struggling against the effects of the opiate he was distinctly angry and i didn t blame him tom had a southern temper his eyes were open now and they showed a gleam or two of fire but the drug still clouded his mind and bound his tongue c c confound you he stammered i ll s smash you he tried to rise from the couch with all his size he was very weak now i thrust him back with one arm he lay there glaring like a lion in a trap that will hold you for a while you old loony i said to myself i got up and lit my pipe for i was needing a smoke i walked around a bit congratulating myself on my brilliant idea i heard a snore i looked around tom was asleep again i walked over and punched him on the jaw he looked at me as pleasant and ungrudging as an idiot i chewed my pipe and gave it to him hard i want you to recover yourself and get out of my rooms as soon as you can i said insultingly i ve told you what i think of you if you have any honour or honesty left you will think twice before you attempt again to associate with gentlemen she s a poor girl isn t she i sneered somewhat too plain and unfashionable for us since we got our money be ashamed to walk on fifth avenue with her wouldn t you hopkins you re forty seven times worse than a cad who cares for your money i don t i ll bet that girl don t perhaps if you didn t have it you d be more of a man as it is you ve made a cur of yourself and i thought that quite dramatic perhaps broken a faithful heart old tom hopkins breaking a faithful heart let me be rid of you as soon as possible i turned my back on tom and winked at myself in a mirror i heard him moving and i turned again quickly i didn t want a hundred and ninety eight pounds falling on me from the rear but tom had only turned partly over and laid one arm across his face he spoke a few words rather more distinctly than before i couldn t have talked this way to you billy even if i d heard people lyin bout you but jus soon s i can s stand up i ll break your neck don f get it i did feel a little ashamed then but it was to save tom in the morning when i explained it we would have a good laugh over it together in about twenty minutes tom dropped into a sound easy slumber i felt his pulse listened to his respiration and let him sleep everything was normal and tom was safe i went into the other room and tumbled into bed i found tom up and dressed when i awoke the next morning he was entirely himself again with the exception of shaky nerves and a tongue like a white oak chip what an idiot i was he said thoughtfully i remember thinking that quinine bottle looked queer while i was taking the dose have much trouble in bringing me round i told him no his memory seemed bad about the entire affair i concluded that he had no recollection of my efforts to keep him awake and decided not to enlighten him some other time i thought when he was feeling better we would have some fun over it when tom was ready to go he stopped with the door open and shook my hand much obliged old fellow he said quietly for taking so much trouble with me and for what you said i m going down now to telegraph to the little girl a ghost of a chance actually a hod repeated mrs kinsolving pathetically mrs bellamy bellmore arched a sympathetic eyebrow thus she expressed condolence and a generous amount of apparent surprise fancy her telling everywhere recapitulated mrs kinsolving that she saw a ghost in the apartment she occupied here our choicest guest room a ghost carrying a hod on its shoulder the ghost of an old man in overalls smoking a pipe and carrying a hod the very absurdity of the thing shows her malicious intent there never was a kinsolving that carried a hod every one knows that mr kinsolving s father accumulated his money by large building contracts but he never worked a day with his own hands he had this house built from his own plans but oh a hod why need she have been so cruel and malicious it is really too bad murmured mrs bellmore with an approving glance of her fine eyes about the vast chamber done in lilac and old gold and it was in this room she saw it oh no i m not afraid of ghosts don t have the least fear on my account i m glad you put me in here i think family ghosts so interesting but really the story does sound a little inconsistent i should have expected something better from mrs fischer suympkins don t they carry bricks in hods why should a ghost bring bricks into a villa built of marble and stone i m so sorry but it makes me think that age is beginning to tell upon mrs fischer suympkins this house continued mrs kinsolving was built upon the site of an old one used by the family during the revolution there wouldn t be anything strange in its having a ghost and there was a captain kinsolving who fought in general greene s army though we ve never been able to secure any papers to vouch for it if there is to be a family ghost why couldn t it have been his instead of a bricklayer s the ghost of a revolutionary ancestor wouldn t be a bad idea agreed mrs bellmore but you know how arbitrary and inconsiderate ghosts can be maybe like love they are engendered in the eye one advantage of those who see ghosts is that their stories can t be disproved by a spiteful eye a revolutionary knapsack might easily be construed to be a hod dear mrs kinsolving think no more of it i am sure it was a knapsack but she told everybody mourned mrs kinsolving inconsolable she insisted upon the details there is the pipe and how are you going to get out of the overalls shan t get into them said mrs bellmore with a prettily suppressed yawn too stiff and wrinkly is that you felice prepare my bath please do you dine at seven at clifftop mrs kinsolving so kind of you to run in for a chat before dinner i love those little touches of informality with a guest they give such a home flavour to a visit so sorry i must be dressing i am so indolent i always postpone it until the last moment mrs fischer suympkins had been the first large plum that the kinsolvings had drawn from the social pie for a long time the pie itself had been out of reach on a top shelf but the purse and the pursuit had at last lowered it mrs fischer suympkins was the heliograph of the smart society parading corps the glitter of her wit and actions passed along the line transmitting whatever was latest and most daring in the game of peep show formerly her fame and leadership had been secure enough not to need the support of such artifices as handing around live frogs for favours at a cotillon but now these things were necessary to the holding of her throne beside middle age had come to preside incongruous at her capers the sensational papers had cut her space from a page to two columns her wit developed a sting her manners became more rough and inconsiderate as if she felt the royal necessity of establishing her autocracy by scorning the conventionalities that bound lesser potentates to some pressure at the command of the kinsolvings she had yielded so far as to honour their house by her presence for an evening and night she had her revenge upon her hostess by relating with grim enjoyment and sarcastic humour her story of the vision carrying the hod to that lady in raptures at having penetrated thus far toward the coveted inner circle the result came as a crushing disappointment everybody either sympathized or laughed and there was little to choose between the two modes of expression but later on mrs kinsolving s hopes and spirits were revived by the capture of a second and greater prize mrs bellamy bellmore had accepted an invitation to visit at clifftop and would remain for three days mrs bellmore was one of the younger matrons whose beauty descent and wealth gave her a reserved seat in the holy of holies that required no strenuous bolstering she was generous enough thus to give mrs kinsolving the accolade that was so poignantly desired and at the same time she thought how much it would please terence perhaps it would end by solving him terence was mrs kinsolving s son aged twenty nine quite good looking enough and with two or three attractive and mysterious traits for one he was very devoted to his mother and that was sufficiently odd to deserve notice for others he talked so little that it was irritating and he seemed either very shy or very deep terence interested mrs bellmore because she was not sure which it was she intended to study him a little longer unless she forgot the matter if he was only shy she would abandon him for shyness is a bore if he was deep she would also abandon him for depth is precarious on the afternoon of the third day of her visit terence hunted up mrs bellmore and found her in a nook actually looking at an album it s so good of you said he to come down here and retrieve the day for us i suppose you have heard that mrs fischer suympkins scuttled the ship before she left she knocked a whole plank out of the bottom with a hod my mother is grieving herself ill about it can t you manage to see a ghost for us while you are here mrs bellmore a bang up swell ghost with a coronet on his head and a cheque book under his arm that was a naughty old lady terence said mrs bellmore to tell such stories perhaps you gave her too much supper your mother doesn t really take it seriously does she i think she does answered terence one would think every brick in the hod had dropped on her it s a good mammy and i don t like to see her worried it s to be hoped that the ghost belongs to the hod carriers union and will go out on a strike if he doesn t there will be no peace in this family i m sleeping in the ghost chamber said mrs bellmore pensively but it s so nice i wouldn t change it even if i were afraid which i m not it wouldn t do for me to submit a counter story of a desirable aristocratic shade would it i would do so with pleasure but it seems to me it would be too obviously an antidote for the other narrative to be effective true said terence running two fingers thoughtfully into his crisp brown hair that would never do how would it work to see the same ghost again minus the overalls and have gold bricks in the hod that would elevate the spectre from degrading toil to a financial plane don t you think that would be respectable enough there was an ancestor who fought against the britishers wasn t there your mother said something to that effect i believe so one of those old chaps in raglan vests and golf trousers i don t care a continental for a continental myself but the mother has set her heart on pomp and heraldry and pyrotechnics and i want her to be happy you are a good boy terence said mrs bellmore sweeping her silks close to one side of her not to beat your mother sit here by me and let s look at the album just as people used to do twenty years ago now tell me about every one of them who is this tall dignified gentleman leaning against the horizon with one arm on the corinthian column that old chap with the big feet inquired terence craning his neck that s great uncle o brannigan he used to keep a rathskeller on the bowery i asked you to sit down terence if you are not going to amuse or obey me i shall report in the morning that i saw a ghost wearing an apron and carrying schooners of beer now that is better to be shy at your age terence is a thing that you should blush to acknowledge at breakfast on the last morning of her visit mrs bellmore startled and entranced every one present by announcing positively that she had seen the ghost did it have a a a mrs kinsolving in her suspense and agitation could not bring out the word no indeed far from it there was a chorus of questions from others at the table were n t you frightened what did it do how did it look how was it dressed did it say anything didn t you scream i ll try to answer everything at once said mrs bellmore heroically although i m frightfully hungry something awakened me i m not sure whether it was a noise or a touch and there stood the phantom i never burn a light at night so the room was quite dark but i saw it plainly i wasn t dreaming it was a tall man all misty white from head to foot it wore the full dress of the old colonial days powdered hair baggy coat skirts lace ruffles and a sword it looked intangible and luminous in the dark and moved without a sound yes i was a little frightened at first or startled i should say it was the first ghost i had ever seen no it didn t say anything i didn t scream i raised up on my elbow and then it glided silently away and disappeared when it reached the door mrs kinsolving was in the seventh heaven the description is that of captain kinsolving of general greene s army one of our ancestors she said in a voice that trembled with pride and relief i really think i must apologize for our ghostly relative mrs bellmore i am afraid he must have badly disturbed your rest terence sent a smile of pleased congratulation toward his mother attainment was mrs kinsolving s at last and he loved to see her happy i suppose i ought to be ashamed to confess said mrs bellmore who was now enjoying her breakfast that i wasn t very much disturbed i presume it would have been the customary thing to scream and faint and have all of you running about in picturesque costumes but after the first alarm was over i really couldn t work myself up to a panic the ghost retired from the stage quietly and peacefully after doing its little turn and i went to sleep again nearly all listened politely accepted mrs bellmore s story as a made up affair charitably offered as an offset to the unkind vision seen by mrs fischer suympkins but one or two present perceived that her assertions bore the genuine stamp of her own convictions truth and candour seemed to attend upon every word even a scoffer at ghosts if he were very observant would have been forced to admit that she had at least in a very vivid dream been honestly aware of the weird visitor soon mrs bellmore s maid was packing in two hours the auto would come to convey her to the station as terence was strolling upon the east piazza mrs bellmore came up to him with a confidential sparkle in her eye i didn t wish to tell the others all of it she said but i will tell you in a way i think you should be held responsible can you guess in what manner that ghost awakened me last night rattled chains suggested terence after some thought or groaned they usually do one or the other do you happen to know continued mrs bellmore with sudden irrelevancy if i resemble any one of the female relatives of your restless ancestor captain kinsolving don t think so said terence with an extremely puzzled air never heard of any of them being noted beauties then why said mrs bellmore looking the young man gravely in the eye should that ghost have kissed me as i m sure it did heavens exclaimed terence in wide eyed amazement you don t mean that mrs bellmore did he actually kiss you i said it corrected mrs bellmore i hope the impersonal pronoun is correctly used but why did you say i was responsible because you are the only living male relative of the ghost i see unto the third and fourth generation but seriously did he did it how do you know how does any one know i was asleep and that is what awakened me i m almost certain almost well i awoke just as oh can t you understand what i mean when anything arouses you suddenly you are not positive whether you dreamed or and yet you know that dear me terence must i dissect the most elementary sensations in order to accommodate your extremely practical intelligence but about kissing ghosts you know said terence humbly i require the most primary instruction i never kissed a ghost is it is it the sensation said mrs bellmore with deliberate but slightly smiling emphasis since you are seeking instruction is a mingling of the material and the spiritual of course said terence suddenly growing serious it was a dream or some kind of an hallucination nobody believes in spirits these days if you told the tale out of kindness of heart mrs bellmore i can t express how grateful i am to you it has made my mother supremely happy that revolutionary ancestor was a stunning idea mrs bellmore sighed the usual fate of ghost seers is mine she said resignedly my privileged encounter with a spirit is attributed to lobster salad or mendacity well i have at least one memory left from the wreck a kiss from the unseen world was captain kinsolving a very brave man do you know terence he was licked at yorktown i believe said terence reflecting they say he skedaddled with his company after the first battle there i thought he must have been timid said mrs bellmore absently he might have had another another battle asked terence dully what else could i mean i must go and get ready now the auto will be here in an hour i ve enjoyed clifftop immensely such a lovely morning isn t it terence on her way to the station mrs bellmore took from her bag a silk handkerchief and looked at it with a little peculiar smile then she tied it in several very hard knots and threw it at a convenient moment over the edge of the cliff along which the road ran in his room terence was giving some directions to his man brooks have this stuff done up in a parcel he said and ship it to the address on that card the card was that of a new york costumer the stuff was a gentleman s costume of the days of made of white satin with silver buckles white silk stockings and white kid shoes a powdered wig and a sword completed the dress and look about brooks added terence a little anxiously for a silk handkerchief with my initials in one corner i must have dropped it somewhere it was a month later when mrs bellmore and one or two others of the smart crowd were making up a list of names for a coaching trip through the catskills mrs bellmore looked over the list for a final censoring the name of terence kinsolving was there mrs bellmore ran her prohibitive pencil lightly through the name too shy she murmured sweetly in explanation jimmy hayes and muriel i supper was over and there had fallen upon the camp the silence that accompanies the rolling of corn husk cigarettes the water hole shone from the dark earth like a patch of fallen sky coyotes yelped dull thumps indicated the rocking horse movements of the hobbled ponies as they moved to fresh grass a half troop of the frontier battalion of texas rangers were distributed about the fire a well known sound the fluttering and scraping of chaparral against wooden stirrups came from the thick brush above the camp the rangers listened cautiously they heard a loud and cheerful voice call out reassuringly brace up muriel old girl we re most there now been a long ride for ye ain t it ye old antediluvian handful of animated carpet tacks hey now quit a tryin to kiss me don t hold on to my neck so tight this here paint hoss ain t any too shore footed let me tell ye he s liable to dump us both off if we don t watch out two minutes of waiting brought a tired paint pony single footing into camp a gangling youth of twenty lolled in the saddle of the muriel whom he had been addressing nothing was to be seen hi fellows shouted the rider cheerfully this here s a letter fer lieutenant manning he dismounted unsaddled dropped the coils of his stake rope and got his hobbles from the saddle horn while lieutenant manning in command was reading the letter the newcomer rubbed solicitously at some dried mud in the loops of the hobbles showing a consideration for the forelegs of his mount boys said the lieutenant waving his hand to the rangers this is mr james hayes he s a new member of the company captain mclean sends him down from el paso the boys will see that you have some supper hayes as soon as you get your pony hobbled the recruit was received cordially by the rangers still they observed him shrewdly and with suspended judgment picking a comrade on the border is done with ten times the care and discretion with which a girl chooses a sweetheart on your side kicker s nerve loyalty aim and coolness your own life may depend many times after a hearty supper hayes joined the smokers about the fire his appearance did not settle all the questions in the minds of his brother rangers they saw simply a loose lank youth with tow coloured sun burned hair and a berry brown ingenuous face that wore a quizzical good natured smile fellows said the new ranger i m goin to interduce to you a lady friend of mine ain t ever heard anybody call her a beauty but you ll all admit she s got some fine points about her come along muriel he held open the front of his blue flannel shirt out of it crawled a horned frog a bright red ribbon was tied jauntily around its spiky neck it crawled to its owner s knee and sat there motionless this here muriel said hayes with an oratorical wave of his hand has got qualities she never talks back she always stays at home and she s satisfied with one red dress for every day and sunday too look at that blame insect said one of the rangers with a grin i ve seen plenty of them horny frogs but i never knew anybody to have one for a side partner does the blame thing know you from anybody else take it over there and see said hayes the stumpy little lizard known as the horned frog is harmless he has the hideousness of the prehistoric monsters whose reduced descendant he is but he is gentler than the dove the ranger took muriel from hayes s knee and went back to his seat on a roll of blankets the captive twisted and clawed and struggled vigorously in his hand after holding it for a moment or two the ranger set it upon the ground awkwardly but swiftly the frog worked its four oddly moving legs until it stopped close by hayes s foot well dang my hide said the other ranger the little cuss knows you never thought them insects had that much sense ii jimmy hayes became a favourite in the ranger camp he had an endless store of good nature and a mild perennial quality of humour that is well adapted to camp life he was never without his horned frog in the bosom of his shirt during rides on h is knee or shoulder in camp under his blankets at night the ugly little beast never left him jimmy was a humourist of a type that prevails in the rural south and west unskilled in originating methods of amusing or in witty conceptions he had hit upon a comical idea and clung to it reverently it had seemed to jimmy a very funny thing to have about his person with which to amuse his friends a tame horned frog with a red ribbon around its neck as it was a happy idea why not perpetuate it the sentiments existing between jimmy and the frog cannot be exactly determined the capability of the horned frog for lasting affection is a subject upon which we have had no symposiums it is easier to guess jimmy s feelings muriel was his chef d oeuvre of wit and as such he cherished her he caught flies for her and shielded her from sudden northers yet his care was half selfish and when the time came she repaid him a thousand fold other muriels have thus overbalanced the light attentions of other jimmies not at once did jimmy hayes attain full brotherhood with his comrades they loved him for his simplicity and drollness but there hung above him a great sword of suspended judgment to make merry in camp is not all of a ranger s life there are horse thieves to trail desperate criminals to run down bravos to battle with bandits to rout out of the chaparral peace and order to be compelled at the muzzle of a six shooter jimmy had been most generally a cow puncher he said he was inexperienced in ranger methods of warfare therefore the rangers speculated apart and solemnly as to how he would stand fire for let it be known the honour and pride of each ranger company is the individual bravery of its members for two months the border was quiet the rangers lolled listless in camp and then bringing joy to the rusting guardians of the frontier sebastiano saldar an eminent mexican desperado and cattle thief crossed the rio grande with his gang and began to lay waste the texas side there were indications that jimmy hayes would soon have the opportunity to show his mettle the rangers patrolled with alacrity but saldar s men were mounted like lochinvar and were hard to catch one evening about sundown the rangers halted for supper after a long ride their horses stood panting with their saddles on the men were frying bacon and boiling coffee suddenly out of the brush sebastiano saldar and his gang dashed upon them with blazing six shooters and high voiced yells it was a neat surprise the rangers swore in annoyed tones and got their winchesters busy but the attack was only a spectacular dash of the purest mexican type after the florid demonstration the raiders galloped away yelling down the river the rangers mounted and pursued but in less than two miles the fagged ponies laboured so that lieutenant manning gave the word to abandon the chase and return to the camp then it was discovered that jimmy hayes was missing some one remembered having seen him run for his pony when the attack began but no one had set eyes on him since morning came but no jimmy they searched the country around on the theory that he had been killed or wounded but without success then they followed after saldar s gang but it seemed to have disappeared manning concluded that the wily mexican had recrossed the river after his theatric farewell and indeed no further depredations f rom him were reported this gave the rangers time to nurse a soreness they had as has been said the pride and honour of the company is the individual bravery of its members and now they believed that jimmy hayes had turned coward at the whiz of mexican bullets there was no other deduction buck davis pointed out that not a shot was fired by saldar s gang after jimmy was seen running for his horse there was no way for him to have been shot no he had fled from his first fight and afterward he would not return aware that the scorn of his comrades would be a worse thing to face than the muzzles of many rifles so manning s detachment of mclean s company frontier battalion was gloomy it was the first blot on its escutcheon never before in the history of the service had a ranger shown the white feather all of them had liked jimmy hayes and that made it worse days weeks and months went by and still that little cloud of unforgotten cowardice hung above the camp iii nearly a year afterward after many camping grounds and many hundreds of miles guarded and defended lieutenant manning with almost the same detachment of men was sent to a point only a few miles below their old camp on the river to look after some smuggling there one afternoon while they were riding through a dense mesquite flat they came upon a patch of open hog wallow prairie there they rode upon the scene of an unwritten tragedy in a big hog wallow lay the skeletons of three mexicans their clothing alone served to identify them the largest of the figures had once been sebastiano saldar his great costly sombrero heavy with gold ornamentation a hat famous all along the rio grande lay there pierced by three bullets along the ridge of the hog wallow rested the rusting winchesters of the mexicans all pointing in the same direction the rangers rode in that direction for fifty yards there in a little depression of the ground with his rifle still bearing upon the three lay another skeleton it had been a battle of extermination there was nothing to identify the solitary defender his clothing such as the elements had left distinguishable seemed to be of the kind that any ranchman or cowboy might have worn some cow puncher said manning that they caught out alone good boy he put up a dandy scrap before they got him so that s why we didn t hear from don sebastiano any more and then from beneath the weather beaten rags of the dead man there wriggled out a horned frog with a faded red ribbon around its neck and sat upon the shoulder of its long quiet master mutely it told the story of the untried youth and the swift paint pony how they had outstripped all their comrades that day in the pursuit of the mexican raiders and how the boy had gone down upholding the honour of the company the ranger troop herded close and a simultaneous wild yell arose from their lips the outburst was at once a dirge an apology an epitaph and a paean of triumph a strange requiem you may say over the body of a fallen comrade but if jimmy hayes could have heard it he would have understood the door of unrest i sat an hour by sun in the editor s room of the montopolis weekly bugle i was the editor the saffron rays of the declining sunlight filtered through the cornstalks in micajah widdup s garden patch and cast an amber glory upon my paste pot i sat at the editorial desk in my non rotary revolving chair and prepared my editorial against the oligarchies the room with its one window was already a prey to the twilight one by one with my trenchant sentences i lopped off the heads of the political hydra while i listened full of kindly peace to the home coming cow bells and wondered what mrs flanagan was going to have for supper then in from the dusky quiet street there drifted and perched himself upon a corner of my desk old father time s younger brother his face was beardless and as gnarled as an english walnut i never saw clothes such as he wore they would have reduced joseph s coat to a monochrome but the colours were not the dyer s stains and patches and the work of sun and rust were responsible for the diversity on his coarse shoes was the dust conceivably of a thousand leagues i can describe him no further except to say that he was little and weird and old old i began to estimate in centuries when i saw him yes and i remember that there was an odour a faint odour like aloes or possibly like myrrh or leather and i thought of museums and then i reached for a pad and pencil for business is business and visits of the oldest inhabitants are sacred and honourable requiring to be chronicled i am glad to see you sir i said i would offer you a chair but you see sir i went on i have lived in montopolis only three weeks and i have not met many of our citizens i turned a doubtful eye upon his dust stained shoes and concluded with a newspaper phrase i suppose that you reside in our midst my visitor fumbled in his raiment drew forth a soiled card and handed it to me upon it was written in plain but unsteadily formed characters the name michob ader i am glad you called mr ader i said as one of our older citizens you must view with pride the recent growth and enterprise of montopolis among other improvements i think i can promise that the town will now be provided with a live enterprising newspa do ye know the name on that card asked my caller interrupting me it is not a familiar one to me i said again he visited the depths of his ancient vestments this time he brought out a torn leaf of some book or journal brown and flimsy with age the heading of the page was the turkish spy in old style type the printing upon it was this there is a man come to paris in this year who pretends to have lived these sixteen hundred years he says of himself that he was a shoemaker in jerusalem at the time of the crucifixion that his name is michob ader and that when jesus the christian messias was condemned by pontius pilate the roman president he paused to rest while bearing his cross to the place of crucifixion before the door of michob ader the shoemaker struck jesus with his fist saying go why tarriest thou the messias a nswered him i indeed am going but thou shalt tarry until i come thereby condemning him to live until the day of judgment he lives forever but at the end of every hundred years he falls into a fit or trance on recovering from which he finds himself in the same state of youth in which he was when jesus suffered being then about thirty years of age such is the story of the wandering jew as told by michob ader who relates here the printing ended i must have muttered aloud something to myself about the wandering jew for the old man spake up bitterly and loudly tis a lie said he like nine tenths of what ye call history tis a gentile i am and no jew i am after footing it out of jerusalem my son but if that makes me a jew then everything that comes out of a bottle is babies milk ye have my name on the card ye hold and ye have read the bit of paper they call the turkish spy that printed the news when i stepped into their office on the th day of june in the year just as i have called upon ye to day i laid down my pencil and pad clearly it would not do here was an item for the local column of the bugle that but it would not do still fragments of the impossible personal began to flit through my conventionalized brain uncle michob is as spry on his legs as a young chap of only a thousand or so our venerable caller relates with pride that george wash no ptolemy the great once dandled him on his knee at his father s house uncle michob says that our wet spring was nothing in comparison with the dampness that ruined the crops around mount ararat when he was a boy but no no it would not do i was trying to think of some conversational subject with which to interest my visitor and was hesitating between walking matches and the pliocene age when the old man suddenly began to weep poignantly and distressfully cheer up mr ader i said a little awkwardly this matter may blow over in a few hundred years more there has already been a decided reaction in favour of judas iscariot and colonel burr and the celebrated violinist signor nero this is the age of whitewash you must not allow yourself to become down hearted unknowingly i had struck a chord the old man blinked belligerently through his senile tears tis time he said that the liars be doin justice to somebody yer historians are no more than a pack of old women gabblin at a wake a finer man than the imperor nero niver wore sandals man i was at the burnin of rome i knowed the imperor well for in them days i was a well known char acter in thim days they had rayspect for a man that lived forever but twas of the imperor nero i was goin to tell ye i struck into rome up the appian way on the night of july the th the year i had just stepped down by way of siberia and afghanistan and one foot of me had a frost bite and the other a blister burned by the sand of the desert and i was feelin a bit blue from doin patrol duty from the north pole down to the last chance corner in patagonia and bein miscalled a jew in the bargain well i m tellin ye i was passin the circus maximus and it was dark as pitch over the way and then i heard somebody sing out is that you michob over ag inst the wall hid out amongst a pile of barrels and old dry goods boxes was the imperor nero wid his togy wrapped around his toes smokin a long black segar have one michob says he none of the weeds for me says i nayther pipe nor segar what s the use says i of smokin when ye ve not got the ghost of a chance of killin yeself by doin it true for ye michob ader my perpetual jew says the imperor ye re not always wandering sure tis danger gives the spice of our pleasures next to their bein forbidden and for what says i do ye smoke be night in dark places widout even a cinturion in plain clothes to attend ye have ye ever heard michob says the imperor of predestinarianism i ve had the cousin of it says i i ve been on the trot with pedestrianism for many a year and more to come as ye well know the longer word says me friend nero is the tachin of this new sect of people they call the christians tis them that s raysponsible for me smokin be night in holes and corners of the dark and then i sets down and takes off a shoe and rubs me foot that is frosted and the imperor tells me about it it seems that since i passed that way before the imperor had mandamused the impress wid a divorce suit and misses poppaea a cilibrated lady was ingaged widout riferences as housekeeper at the palace all in one day says the imperor she puts up new lace windy curtains in the palace and joins the anti tobacco society and whin i feels the need of a smoke i must be after sneakin out to these piles of lumber in the dark so there in the dark me and the imperor sat and i told him of me travels and when they say the imperor was an incindiary they lie twas that night the fire started that burnt the city tis my opinion that it began from a stump of segar that he threw down among the boxes and tis a lie that he fiddled he did all he could for six days to stop it sir and now i detected a new flavour to mr michob ader it had not been myrrh or balm or hyssop that i had smelled the emanation was the odour of bad whiskey and worse still of low comedy the sort that small humorists manufacture by clothing the grave and reverend things of legend and history in the vulgar topical frippery that passes for a certain kind of wit michob ader as an impostor claiming nineteen hundred years and playing his part with the decency of respectable lunacy i could endure but as a tedious wag cheapening his egregious story with song book levity his importance as an entertainer grew less and then as if he suspected my thoughts he suddenly shifted his key you ll excuse me sir he whined but sometimes i get a little mixed in my head i am a very old man and it is hard to remember everything i knew that he was right and that i should not try to reconcile him with roman history so i asked for news concerning other ancients with whom he had walked familiar above my desk hung an engraving of raphael s cherubs you could yet make out their forms though the dust blurred their outlines strangely ye calls them cher rubs cackled the old man babes ye fancy they are with wings and there s one wid legs and a bow and arrow that ye call cupid i know where they was found the great great great grandfather of thim all was a billy goat bein an editor sir do ye happen to know where solomon s temple stood i fancied that it was in in persia well i did not know tis not in history nor in the bible where it was but i saw it meself the first pictures of cher rubs and cupids was sculptured upon thim walls and pillars two of the biggest sir stood in the adytum to form the baldachin over the ark but the wings of thim sculptures was intindid for horns and the faces was the faces of goats ten thousand goats there was in and about the temple and your cher rubs was billy goats in the days of king solomon but the painters misconstrued the horns into wings and i knew tamerlane the lame timour sir very well i saw him at keghut and at zaranj he was a little man no larger than yerself with hair the colour of an amber pipe stem they buried him at samarkand i was at the wake sir oh he was a fine built man in his coffin six feet long with black whiskers to his face and i see em throw turnips at the imperor vispacian in africa all over the world i have tramped sir without the body of me findin any rest twas so commanded i saw jerusalem destroyed and pompeii go up in the fireworks and i was at the coronation of charlemagne and the lynchin of joan of arc and everywhere i go there comes storms and revolutions and plagues and fires twas so commanded ye have heard of the wandering jew tis all so except that divil a bit am i a jew but history lies as i have told ye are ye quite sure sir that ye haven t a drop of whiskey convenient ye well know that i have many miles of walking before me i have none said i and if you please i am about to leave for my supper i pushed my chair back creakingly this ancient landlubber was becoming as great an affliction as any cross bowed mariner he shook a musty effluvium from his piebald clothes overturned my inkstand and went on with his insufferable nonsense i wouldn t mind it so much he complained if it wasn t for the work i must do on good fridays ye know about pontius pilate sir of course his body whin he killed himself was pitched into a lake on the alps mountains now listen to the job that tis mine to perform on the night of ivery good friday the ould divil goes down in the pool and drags up pontius and the water is bilin and spewin like a wash pot and the ould divil sets the body on top of a throne on the rocks and thin comes me share of the job oh sir ye would pity me thin ye would pray for the poor wandering jew that niver was a jew if ye could see the horror of the thing that i must do tis i that must fetch a bowl of water and kneel down before it till it washes its hands i declare to ye that pontius pilate a man dead two hundred years dragged up with the lake slime coverin him and fishes wrigglin inside of him widout eyes and in the discomposition of the body sits there sir and washes his hands in the bowl i hold for him on good fridays twas so commanded clearly the matter had progressed far beyond the scope of the bugle s local column there might have been employment here for the alienist or for those who circulate the pledge but i had had enough of it i got up and repeated that i must go at this he seized my coat grovelled upon my desk and burst again into distressful weeping whatever it was about i said to myself that his grief was genuine come now mr ader i said soothingly what is the matter the answer came brokenly through his racking sobs because i would not let the poor christ rest upon the step his hallucination seemed beyond all reasonable answer yet the effect of it upon him scarcely merited disrespect but i knew nothing that might assuage it and i told him once more that both of us should be leaving the office at once obedient at last he raised himself from my dishevelled desk and permitted me to half lift him to the floor the gale of his grief had blown away his words his freshet of tears had soaked away the crust of his grief reminiscence died in him at least the coherent part of it twas me that did it he muttered as i led him toward the door me the shoemaker of jerusalem i got him to the sidewalk and in the augmented light i saw that his face was seared and lined and warped by a sadness almost incredibly the product of a single lifetime and then high up in the firmamental darkness we heard the clamant cries of some great passing birds my wandering jew lifted his hand with side tilted head the seven whistlers he said as one introduces well known friends wild geese said i but i confess that their number is beyond me they follow me everywhere he said twas so commanded what ye hear is the souls of the seven jews that helped with the crucifixion sometimes they re plovers and sometimes geese but ye ll find them always flyin where i go i stood uncertain how to take my leave i looked down the street shuffled my feet looked back again and felt my hair rise the old man had disappeared and then my capillaries relaxed for i dimly saw him footing it away through the darkness but he walked so swiftly and silently and contrary to the gait promised by his age that my composure was not all restored though i knew not why that night i was foolish enough to take down some dust covered volumes from my modest shelves i searched hermippus redivvus and salathiel and the pepys collection in vain and then in a book called the citizen of the world and in one two centuries old i came upon what i desired michob ader had indeed come to paris in the year and related to the turkish spy an extraordinary story he claimed to be the wandering jew and that but here i fell asleep for my editorial duties had not been light that day judge hoover was the bugle s candidate for congress having to confer with him i sought his home early the next morning and we walked together down town through a little street with which i was unfamiliar did you ever hear of michob ader i asked him smiling why yes said the judge and that reminds me of my shoes he has for mending here is his shop now judge hoover stepped into a dingy small shop i looked up at the sign and saw mike o bader boot and shoe maker on it some wild geese passed above honking clearly i scratched my ear and frowned and then trailed into the shop there sat my wandering jew on his shoemaker s bench trimming a half sole he was drabbled with dew grass stained unkempt and miserable and on his face was still the unexplained wretchedness the problematic sorrow the esoteric woe that had been written there by nothing less it seemed than the stylus of the centuries judge hoover inquired kindly concerning his shoes the old shoemaker looked up and spoke sanely enough he had been ill he said for a few days the next day the shoes would be ready he looked at me and i could see that i had no place in his memory so out we went and on our way old mike remarked the candidate has been on one of his sprees he gets crazy drunk regularly once a month but he s a good shoemaker what is his history i inquired whiskey epitomized judge hoover that explains him i was silent but i did not accept the explanation and so when i had the chance i asked old man sellers who browsed daily on my exchanges mike o bader said he was makin shoes in montopolis when i come here goin on fifteen year ago i guess whiskey s his trouble once a month he gets off the track and stays so a week he s got a rigmarole somethin about his bein a jew pedler that he tells ev rybody nobody won t listen to him any more when he s sober he ain t sich a fool he s got a sight of books in the back room of his shop that he reads i guess you can lay all his trouble to whiskey but again i would not not yet was my wandering jew rightly construed for me i trust that women may not be allowed a title to all the curiosity in the world so when montopolis s oldest inhabitant some ninety score years younger than michob ader dropped in to acquire promulgation in print i siphoned his perpetual trickle of reminiscence in the direction of the uninterpreted maker of shoes uncle abner was the complete history of montopolis bound in butternut o bader he quavered come here in he was the first shoemaker in the place folks generally considers him crazy at times now but he don t harm nobody i s pose drinkin upset his mind yes drinkin very likely done it it s a powerful bad thing drinkin i m an old old man sir and i never see no good in drinkin i felt disappointment i was willing to admit drink in the case of my shoemaker but i preferred it as a recourse instead of a cause why had he pitched upon his perpetual strange note of the wandering jew why his unutterable grief during his aberration i could not yet accept whiskey as an explanation did mike o bader ever have a great loss or trouble of any kind i asked lemme see about thirty year ago there was somethin of the kind i recollect montopolis sir in them days used to be a mighty strict place well mike o bader had a daughter then a right pretty girl she was too gay a sort for montopolis so one day she slips off to another town and runs away with a circus it was two years before she comes back all fixed up in fine clothes and rings and jewellery to see mike he wouldn t have nothin to do with her so she stays around town awhile anyway i reckon the men folks wouldn t have raised no objections but the women egged em on to order her to leave town but she had plenty of spunk and told em to mind their own business so one night they decided to run her away a crowd of men and women drove her out of her house and chased her with sticks and stones she run to her father s door callin for help mike opens it and when he sees who it is he hits her with his fist and knocks her down and shuts the door and then the crowd kept on chunkin her till she run clear out of town and the next day they finds her drowned dead in hunter s mill pond i mind it all now that was thirty year ago i leaned back in my non rotary revolving chair and nodded gently like a mandarin at my paste pot when old mike has a spell went on uncle abner tepidly garrulous he thinks he s the wanderin jew he is said i nodding away and uncle abner cackled insinuatingly at the editor s remark for he was expecting at least a stickful in the personal notes of the bugle the duplicity of hargraves when major pendleton talbot of mobile sir and his daughter miss lydia talbot came to washington to reside they selected for a boarding place a house that stood fifty yards back from one of the quietest avenues it was an old fashioned brick building with a portico upheld by tall white pillars the yard was shaded by stately locusts and elms and a catalpa tree in season rained its pink and white blossoms upon the grass rows of high box bushes lined the fence and walks it was the southern style and aspect of the place that pleased the eyes of the talbots in this pleasant private boarding house they engaged rooms including a study for major talbot who was adding the finishing chapters to his book anecdotes and reminiscences of the alabama army bench and bar major talbot was of the old old south the present day had little interest or excellence in his eyes his mind lived in that period before the civil war when the talbots owned thousands of acres of fine cotton land and the slaves to till them when the family mansion was the scene of princely hospitality and drew its guests from the aristocracy of the south out of that period he had brought all its old pride and scruples of honour an antiquated and punctilious politeness and you would think its wardrobe such clothes were surely never made within fifty years the major was tall but whenever he made that wonderful archaic genuflexion he called a bow the corners of his frock coat swept the floor that garment was a surprise even to washington which has long ago ceased to shy at the frocks and broadbrimmed hats of southern congressmen one of the boarders christened it a father hubbard and it certainly was high in the waist and full in the skirt but the major with all his queer clothes his immense area of plaited ravelling shirt bosom and the little black string tie with the bow always slipping on one side both was smiled at and liked in mrs vardeman s select boarding house some of the young department clerks would often string him as they called it getting him started upon the subject dearest to him the traditions and history of his beloved southland during his talks he would quote freely from the anecdotes and reminiscences but they were very careful not to let him see their designs for in spite of his sixty eight years he could make the boldest of them uncomfortable under the steady regard of his piercing gray eyes miss lydia was a plump little old maid of thirty five with smoothly drawn tightly twisted hair that made her look still older old fashioned too she was but ante bellum glory did not radiate from her as it did from the major she possessed a thrifty common sense and it was she who handled the finances of the family and met all comers when there were bills to pay the major regarded board bills and wash bills as contemptible nuisances they kept coming in so persistently and so often why the major wanted to know could they not be filed and paid in a lump sum at some convenient period say when the anecdotes and reminiscences had been published and paid for miss lydia would calmly go on with her sewing and say we ll pay as we go as long as the money lasts and then perhaps they ll have to lump it most of mrs vardeman s boarders were away during the day being nearly all department clerks and business men but there was one of them who was about the house a great deal from morning to night this was a young man named henry hopkins hargraves every one in the house addressed him by his full name who was engaged at one of the popular vaudeville theatres vaudeville has risen to such a respectable plane in the last few years and mr hargraves was such a modest and well mannered person that mrs vardeman could find no objection to enrolling him upon her list of boarders at the theatre hargraves was known as an all round dialect comedian having a large repertoire of german irish swede and black face specialties but mr hargraves was ambitious and often spoke of his great desire to succeed in legitimate comedy this young man appeared to conceive a strong fancy for major talbot whenever that gentleman would begin his southern reminiscences or repeat some of the liveliest of the anecdotes hargraves could always be found the most attentive among his listeners for a time the major showed an inclination to discourage the advances of the play actor as he privately termed him but soon the young man s agreeable manner and indubitable appreciation of the old gentleman s stories completely won him over it was not long before the two were like old chums the major set apart each afternoon to read to him the manuscript of his book during the anecdotes hargraves never failed to laugh at exactly the right point the major was moved to declare to miss lydia one day that young hargraves possessed remarkable perception and a gratifying respect for the old regime and when it came to talking of those old days if major talbot liked to talk mr hargraves was entranced to listen like almost all old people who talk of the past the major loved to linger over details in describing the splendid almost royal days of the old planters he would hesitate until he had recalled the name of the negro who held his horse or the exact date of certain minor happenings or the number of bales of cotton raised in such a year but hargraves never grew impatient or lost interest on the contrary he would advance questions on a variety of subjects connected with the life of that time and he n ever failed to extract ready replies the fox hunts the possum suppers the hoe downs and jubilees in the negro quarters the banquets in the plantation house hall when invitations went for fifty miles around the occasional feuds with the neighbouring gentry the major s duel with rathbone culbertson about kitty chalmers who afterward married a thwaite of south carolina and private yacht races for fabulous sums on mobile bay the quaint beliefs improvident habits and loyal virtues of the old slaves all these were subjects that held both the major and hargraves absorbed for hours at a time sometimes at night when the young man would be coming upstairs to his room after his turn at the theatre was over the major would appear at the door of his study and beckon archly to him going in hargraves would find a little table set with a decanter sugar bowl fruit and a big bunch of fresh green mint it occurred to me the major would begin he was always ceremonious that perhaps you might have found your duties at the at your place of occupation sufficiently arduous to enable you mr hargraves to appreciate what the poet might well have had in his mind when he wrote tired nature s sweet restorer one of our southern juleps it was a fascination to hargraves to watch him make it he took rank among artists when he began and he never varied the process with what delicacy he bruised the mint with what exquisite nicety he estimated the ingredients with what solicitous care he capped the compound with the scarlet fruit glowing against the dark green fringe and then the hospitality and grace with which he offered it after the selected oat straws had been plunged into its tinkling depths after about four months in washington miss lydia discovered one morning that they were almost without money the anecdotes and reminiscences was completed but publishers had not jumped at the collected gems of alabama sense and wit the rental of a small house which they still owned in mobile was two months in arrears their board money for the month would be due in three days miss lydia called her father to a consultation no money said he with a surprised look it is quite annoying to be called on so frequently for these petty sums really i the major searched his pockets he found only a two dollar bill which he returned to his vest pocket i must attend to this at once lydia he said kindly get me my umbrella and i will go down town immediately the congressman from our district general fulghum assured me some days ago that he would use his influence to get my book published at an early date i will go to his hotel at once and see what arrangement has been made with a sad little smile miss lydia watched him button his father hubbard and depart pausing at the door as he always did to bow profoundly that evening at dark he returned it seemed that congressman fulghum had seen the publisher who had the major s manuscript for reading that person had said that if the anecdotes etc were carefully pruned down about one half in order to eliminate the sectional and class prejudice with which the book was dyed from end to end he might consider its publication the major was in a white heat of anger but regained his equanimity according to his code of manners as soon as he was in miss lydia s presence we must have money said miss lydia with a little wrinkle above her nose give me the two dollars and i will telegraph to uncle ralph for some to night the major drew a small envelope from his upper vest pocket and tossed it on the table perhaps it was injudicious he said mildly but the sum was so merely nominal that i bought tickets to the theatre to night it s a new war drama lydia i thought you would be pleased to witness its first production in washington i am told that the south has very fair treatment in the play i confess i should like to see the performance myself miss lydia threw up her hands in silent despair still as the tickets were bought they might as well be used so that evening as they sat in the theatre listening to the lively overture even miss lydia was minded to relegate their troubles for the hour to second place the major in spotless linen with his extraordinary coat showing only where it was closely buttoned and his white hair smoothly roached looked really fine and distinguished the curtain went up on the first act of a magnolia flower revealing a typical southern plantation scen e major talbot betrayed some interest oh see exclaimed miss lydia nudging his arm and pointing to her programme the major put on his glasses and read the line in the cast of characters that her finger indicated col webster calhoun h hopkins hargraves it s our mr hargraves said miss lydia it must be his first appearance in what he calls the legitimate i m so glad for him not until the second act did col webster calhoun appear upon the stage when he made his entry major talbot gave an audible sniff glared at him and seemed to freeze solid miss lydia uttered a little ambiguous squeak and crumpled her programme in her hand for colonel calhoun was made up as nearly resembling major talbot as one pea does another the long thin white hair curly at the ends the aristocratic beak of a nose the crumpled wide ravelling shirt front the string tie with the bow nearly under one ear were almost exactly duplicated and then to clinch the imitation he wore the twin to the major s supposed to be unparalleled coat high collared baggy empire waisted ample skirted hanging a foot lower in front than behind the garment could have been designed from no other pattern from then on the major and miss lydia sat bewitched and saw the counterfeit presentment of a haughty talbot dragged as the major afterward expressed it through the slanderous mire of a corrupt st age mr hargraves had used his opportunities well he had caught the major s little idiosyncrasies of speech accent and intonation and his pompous courtliness to perfection exaggerating all to the purposes of the stage when he performed that marvellous bow that the major fondly imagined to be the pink of all salutations the audience sent forth a sudden round of hearty applause miss lydia sat immovable not daring to glance toward her father sometimes her hand next to him would be laid against her cheek as if to conceal the smile which in spite of her disapproval she could not entirely suppress the culmination of hargraves s audacious imitation took place in the third act the scene is where colonel calhoun entertains a few of the neighbouring planters in his den standing at a table in the centre of the stage with his friends grouped about him he delivers that inimitable rambling character monologue so famous in a magnolia flower at the same time that he deftly makes juleps for the party major talbot sitting quietly but white with indignation heard his best stories retold his pet theories and hobbies advanced and expanded and the dream of the anecdotes and reminiscences served exaggerated and garbled his favourite narrative that of his duel with rathbone culbertson was not omitted and it was delivered with more fire egotism and gusto than the major himself put into it the monologue concluded with a quaint delicious witty little lecture on the art of concocting a julep illustrated by the act here major talbot s delicate but showy science was reproduced to a hair s breadth from his dainty handling of the fragrant weed the one thousandth part of a grain too much pressure gentlemen and you extract the bitterness instead of the aroma of this heaven bestowed plant to his solicitous selection of the oaten straws at the close of the scene the audience raised a tumultuous roar of appreciation the portrayal of the type was so exact so sure and thorough that the leading characters in the play were forgotten after repeated calls hargraves came before the curtain and bowed his rather boyish face bright and flushed with the knowledge of success at last miss lydia turned and looked at the major his thin nostrils were working like the gills of a fish he laid both shaking hands upon the arms of his chair to rise we will go lydia he said chokingly this is an abominable desecration before he could rise she pulled him back into his seat we will stay it out she declared do you want to advertise the copy by exhibiting the original coat so they remained to the end hargraves s success must have kept him up late that night for neither at the breakfast nor at the dinner table did he appear about three in the afternoon he tapped at the door of major talbot s study the major opened it and hargraves walked in with his hands full of the morning papers too full of his triumph to notice anything unusual in the major s demeanour i put it all over em last night major he began exultantly i had my inning and i think scored here s what the post says his conception and portrayal of the old time southern colonel with his absurd grandiloquence his eccentric garb his quaint idioms and phrases his moth eaten pride of family and his really kind heart fastidious sense of honour and lovable simplicity is the best delineation of a character role on the boards to day the coat worn by colonel calhoun is itself nothing less than an evolution of genius mr hargraves has captured his public how does that sound major for a first nighter i had the honour the major s voice sounded ominously frigid of witnessing your very remarkable performance sir last night hargraves looked disconcerted you were there i didn t know you ever i didn t know you cared for the theatre oh i say major talbot he exclaimed frankly don t you be offended i admit i did get a lot of pointers from you that helped me out wonderfully in the part but it s a type you know not individual the way the audience caught on shows that half the patrons of that theatre are southerners they recognized it mr hargraves said the major who had remained standing you have put upon me an unpardonable insult you have burlesqued my person grossly betrayed my confidence and misused my hospitality if i thought you possessed the faintest conception of what is the sign manual of a gentleman or what is due one i would call you out sir old as i am i will ask you to leave the room sir the actor appeared to be slightly bewildered and seemed hardly to take in the full meaning of the old gentleman s words i am truly sorry you took offence he said regretfully up here we don t look at things just as you people do i know men who would buy out half the house to have their personality put on the stage so the public would recognize it they are not from alabama sir said the major haughtily perhaps not i have a pretty good memory major let me quote a few lines from your book in response to a toast at a banquet given in milledgeville i believe you uttered and intend to have printed these words the northern man is utterly without sentiment or warmth except in so far as the feelings may be turned to his own commercial profit he will suffer without resentment any imputation cast upon the honour of himself or his loved ones that does not bear with it the consequence of pecuniary loss in his charity he gives with a liberal hand but it must be heralded with the trumpet and chronicled in brass do you think that picture is fairer than the one you saw of colonel calhoun last night the description said the major frowning is not without grounds some exag latitude must be allowed in public speaking and in public acting replied hargraves that is not the point persisted the major unrelenting it was a personal caricature i positively decline to overlook it sir major talbot said hargraves with a winning smile i wish you would understand me i want you to know that i never dreamed of insulting you in my profession all life belongs to me i take what i want and what i can and return it over the footlights now if you will let s let it go at that i came in to see you about something else we ve been pretty good friends for some months and i m going to take the risk of offending you again i know you are hard up for money never mind how i found out a boarding house is no place to keep such matters secret and i want you to let me help you out of the pinch i ve been there often enough myself i ve been getting a fair salary all the season and i ve saved some money you re welcome to a couple hundred or even more until you get stop commanded the major with his arm outstretched it seems that my book didn t lie after all you think your money salve will heal all the hurts of honour under no circumstances would i accept a loan from a casual acquaintance and as to you sir i would starve before i would consider your insulting offer of a financial adjustment of the circumstances we have discussed i beg to repeat my request relative to your quitting the apartment hargraves took his departure without another word he also left the house the same day moving as mrs vardeman explained at the supper table nearer the vicinity of the down town theatre where a magnolia flower was booked for a week s run critical was the situation with major talbot and miss lydia there was no one in washington to whom the major s scruples allowed him to apply for a loan miss lydia wrote a letter to uncle ralph but it was doubtful whether that relative s constricted affairs would permit him to furnish help the major was forced to make an apologetic address to mrs vardeman regarding the delayed payment for board referring to delinquent rentals and delayed remittances in a rather confused strain deliverance came from an entirely unexpected source late one afternoon the door maid came up and announced an old coloured man who wanted to see major talbot the major asked that he be sent up to his study soon an old darkey appeared in the doorway with his hat in hand bowing and scraping with one clumsy foot he was quite decently dressed in a baggy suit of black his big coarse shoes shone with a metallic lustre suggestive of stove polish his bushy wool was gray almost white after middle life it is difficult to estimate the age of a negro this one might have seen as many years as had major talbot i be bound you don t know me mars pendleton were his first words the major rose and came forward at the old familiar style of address it was one of the old plantation darkeys without a doubt but they had been widely scattered and he could not recall the voice or face i don t believe i do he said kindly unless you will assist my memory don t you member cindy s mose mars pendleton what migrated mediately after de war wait a moment said the major rubbing his forehead with the tips of his fingers he loved to recall everything connected with those beloved days cindy s mose he reflected you worked among the horses breaking the colts yes i remember now after the surrender you took the name of don t

remember you uncle mose at that age and as you say i m plum growed up and was a blessed long time ago but i m glad to see you even if i can t remember you and she was and so was the major something alive and tangible had come to link them with the happy past the three sat and talked over the olden times the major and uncle mose correcting or prompting each other as they reviewed the plantation scenes and days the major inquired what the old man was doing so far from his home uncle mose am a delicate he explained to de grand baptis convention in dis city i never preached none but bein a residin elder in de church and able fur to pay my own expenses dey sent me along and how did you know we were in washington inquired miss lydia dey s a cullud man works in de hotel whar i stops what

laid his other upon his shoulder dear faithful old servitor he said in an unsteady voice i don t mind saying to you that mars pendleton spent his last dollar in the world a week ago we will accept this money uncle mose since in a way it is a sort of payment as well as a token of the loyalty and devotion of the old regime lydia my dear take the money you are better fitted than i to manage its expenditure take it honey said uncle mose hit belongs to you hit s talbot money after uncle mose had gone miss lydia had a good cry for joy and the major turned his face to a corner and smoked his clay pipe volcanically the succeeding days saw the talbots restored to peace and ease miss lydia s face lost its worried look the major appeared in a new frock coat in which he looked like a wax figure personifying the memory of his golden age another publisher who read the manuscript of the anecdotes and reminiscences thought that with a little retouching and toning down of the high lights he could make a really bright and salable volume of it altogether the situation was comfortable and not without the touch of hope that is often sweeter than arrived blessings one day about a week after their piece of good luck a maid brought a letter for miss lydia to her room the postmark showed that it was from new york not knowing any one there miss lydia in a mild flutter of wonder sat down by her table and opened the letter with her scissors this was what she read dear miss talbot i thought you might be glad to learn of my good fortune i have received and accepted an offer of two hundred dollars per week by a new york stock company to play colonel calhoun in a magnolia flower there is something else i wanted you to know i guess you d better not tell major talbot i was anxious to make him some amends for the great help he was to me in studying the part and for the bad humour he was in about it he refused to let me so i did it anyhow i could easily spare the three hundred sincerely yours h hopkins hargraves p s how did i play uncle mose major talbot passing through the hall saw miss lydia s door open and stopped any mail for us this morning lydia dear he asked miss lydia slid the letter beneath a fold of her dress the mobile chronicle came she said promptly it s on the table in your study let me feel your pulse so i went to a doctor how long has it been since you took any alcohol into your system he asked turning my head sidewise i answered oh quite awhile he was a young doctor somewhere between twenty and forty he wore heliotrope socks but he looked like napoleon i liked him immensely now said he i am going to show you the effect of alcohol upon your circulation i think it was circulation he said though it may have been advertising he bared my left arm to the elbow brought out a bottle of whiskey and gave me a drink he began to look more like napoleon i began to like him better then he put a tight compress on my upper arm stopped my pulse with his fingers and squeezed a rubber bulb connected with an apparatus on a stand that looked like a thermometer the mercury jumped up and down without seeming to stop anywhere but the doctor said it registered two hundred and thirty seven or one hundred and sixty five or some such number now said he you see what alcohol does to the blood pressure it s marvellous said i but do you think it a sufficient test have one on me and let s try the other arm but no then he grasped my hand i thought i was doomed and he was saying good bye but all he wanted to do was to jab a needle into the end of a finger and compare the red drop with a lot of fifty cent poker chips that he had fastened to a card it s the haemoglobin test he explained the colour of your blood is wrong well said i i know it should be blue but this is a country of mix ups some of my ancestors were cavaliers but they got thick with some people on nantucket island so i mean said the doctor that the shade of red is too light oh said i it s a case of matching instead of matches the doctor then pounded me severely in the region of the chest when he did that i don t know whether he reminded me most of napoleon or battling or lord nelson then he looked grave and mentioned a string of grievances that the flesh is heir to mostly ending in itis i immediately paid him fifteen dollars on account is or are it or some or any of them necessarily fatal i asked i thought my connection with the matter justified my manifesting a certain amount of interest all of them he answered cheerfully but their progress may be arrested with care and proper continuous treatment you may live to be eighty five or ninety i began to think of the doctor s bill eighty five would be sufficient i am sure was my comment i paid him ten dollars more on account the first thing to do he said with renewed animation is to find a sanitarium where you will get a complete rest for a while and allow your nerves to get into a better condition i myself will go with you and select a suitable one so he took me to a mad house in the catskills it was on a bare mountain frequented only by infrequent frequenters you could see nothing but stones and boulders some patches of snow and scattered pine trees the young physician in charge was most agreeable he gave me a stimulant without applying a compress to the arm it was luncheon time and we were invited to partake there were about twenty inmates at little tables in the dining room the young physician in charge came to our table and said it is a custom with our guests not to regard themselves as patients hut merely as tired ladies and gentlemen taking a rest whatever slight maladies they may have are never alluded to in conversation my doctor called loudly to a waitress to bring some phosphoglycerate of lime hash dog bread bromo seltzer pancakes and nux vomica tea for my repast then a sound arose like a sudden wind storm among pine trees it was produced by every guest in the room whispering loudly neurasthenia except one man with a nose whom i distinctly heard say chronic alcoholism i hope to meet him again the physician in charge turned and walked away an hour or so after luncheon he conducted us to the workshop say fifty yards from the house thither the guests had been conducted by the physician in charge s understudy and sponge holder a man with feet and a blue sweater he was so tall that i was not sure he had a face hut the armour packing company would have been delighted with his hands here said the physician in charge our guests find relaxation from past mental worries by devoting themselves to physical labour recreation in reality there were turning lathes carpenters outfits clay modelling tools spinning wheels weaving frames treadmills bass drums enlarged crayon portrait apparatuses blacksmith forges and everything seemingly that could interest the paying lunatic guests of a first rate sanitarium the lady making mud pies in the corner whispered the physician in charge is no other than lula lulington the authoress of the novel entitled why love loves what she is doing now is simply to rest her mind after performing that piece of work i had seen the book why doesn t she do it by writing another one instead i asked as you see i wasn t as far gone as they thought i was the gentleman pouring water through the funnel continued the physician in charge is a wall street broker broken down from overwork i buttoned my coat others he pointed out were architects playing with noah s arks ministers reading darwin s theory of evolution lawyers sawing wood tired out society ladies talking ibsen to the blue sweatered sponge holder a neurotic millionaire lying asleep on the floor and a prominent artist drawing a little red wagon around the room you look pretty strong said the physician in charge to me i think the best mental relaxation for you would be throwing small boulders over the mountainside and then bringing them up again i was a hundred yards away before my doctor overtook me what s the matter he asked the matter is said i that there are no aeroplanes handy so i am going to merrily and hastily jog the foot pathway to yon station and catch the first unlimited soft coal express back to town well said the doctor perhaps you are right this seems hardly the suitable place for you but what you need is rest absolute rest and exercise that night i went to a hotel in the city and said to the clerk what i need is absolute rest and exercise can you give me a room with one of those tall folding beds in it and a relay of bellboys to work it up and down while i rest the clerk rubbed a speck off one of his finger nails and glanced sidewise at a tall man in a white hat sitting in the lobby that man came over and asked me politely if i had seen the shrubbery at the west entrance i had not so he showed it to me and then looked me over i thought you had em he said not unkindly but i guess you re all right you d better go see a doctor old man a week afterward my doctor tested my blood pressure again without the preliminary stimulant he looked to me a little less like napoleon and his socks were of a shade of tan that did not appeal to me what you need he decided is sea air and companionship would a mermaid i began but he slipped on his professional manner i myself he said will take you to the hotel bonair off the coast of long island and see that you get in good shape it is a quiet comfortable resort where you will soon recuperate the hotel bonair proved to be a nine hundred room fashionable hostelry on an island off the main shore everybody who did not dress for dinner was shoved into a side dining room and given only a terrapin and champagne table d hote the bay was a great stamping ground for wealthy yachtsmen the corsair anchored there the day we arrived i saw mr morgan standing on deck eating a cheese sandwich and gazing longingly at the hotel still it was a very inexpensive place nobody could afford to pay their p rices when you went away you simply left your baggage stole a skiff and beat it for the mainland in the night when i had been there one day i got a pad of monogrammed telegraph blanks at the clerk s desk and began to wire to all my friends for get away money my doctor and i played one game of croquet on the golf links and went to sleep on the lawn when we got back to town a thought seemed to occur to him suddenly by the way he asked how do you feel relieved of very much i replied now a consulting physician is different he isn t exactly sure whether he is to be paid or not and this uncertainty insures you either the most careful or the most careless attention my doctor took me to see a consulting physician he made a poor guess and gave me careful attention i liked him immensely he put me through some coordination exercises have you a pain in the back of your head he asked i told him i had not shut your eyes he ordered put your feet close together and jump backward as far as you can i always was a good backward jumper with my eyes shut so i obeyed my head struck the edge of the bathroom door which had been left open and was only three feet away the doctor was very sorry he had overlooked the fact that the door was open he closed it now touch your nose with your right forefinger he said where is it i asked on your face said he i mean my right forefinger i explained oh excuse me said he he reopened the bathroom door and i took my finger out of the crack of it after i had performed the marvellous digito nasal feat i said i do not wish to deceive you as to symptoms doctor i really have something like a pain in the back of my head he ignored the symptom and examined my heart carefully with a latest popular air penny in the slot ear trumpet i felt like a ballad now he said gallop like a horse for about five minutes around the room i gave the best imitation i could of a disqualified percheron being led out of madison square garden then without dropping in a penny he listened to my chest again no glanders in our family doc i said the consulting physician held up his forefinger within three inches of my nose look at my finger he commanded did you ever try pears i began but he went on with his test rapidly now look across the bay at my finger across the bay at my finger at my finger across the bay across the bay at my finger across the bay this for about three minutes he explained that this was a test of the action of the brain it seemed easy to me i never once mistook his finger for the bay i ll bet that if he had used the phrases gaze as it were unpreoccupied outward or rather laterally in the direction of the horizon underlaid so to speak with the adjacent fluid inlet and now returning or rather in a manner withdrawing your attention bestow it upon my upraised digit i ll bet i say that henry james himself could have passed the exami nation after asking me if i had ever had a grand uncle with curvature of the spine or a cousin with swelled ankles the two doctors retired to the bathroom and sat on the edge of the bath tub for their consultation i ate an apple and gazed first at my finger and then across the bay the doctors came out looking grave more they looked tombstones and tennessee papers please copy they wrote out a diet list to which i was to be restricted it had everything that i had ever heard of to eat on it except snails and i never eat a snail unless it overtakes me and bites me first you must follow this diet strictly said the doctors i d follow it a mile if i could get one tenth of what s on it i answered of next importance they went on is outdoor air and exercise and here is a prescription that will be of great benefit to you then all of us took something they took their hats and i took my departure i went to a druggist and showed him the prescription it will be for an ounce bottle he said will you give me a piece of your wrapping cord said i i made a hole in the prescription ran the cord through it tied it around my neck and tucked it inside all of us have a little superstition and mine runs to a confidence in amulets of course there was nothing the matter with me but i was very ill i couldn t work sleep eat or bowl the only way i could get any sympathy was to go without shaving for four days even then somebody would say old man you look as hardy as a pine knot been up for a jaunt in the maine woods eh then suddenly i remembered that i must have outdoor air and exercise so i went down south to john s john is an approximate relative by verdict of a preacher standing with a little book in his hands in a bower of chrysanthemums while a hundred thousand people looked on john has a country house seven miles from pineville it is at an altitude and on the blue ridge mountains in a state too dignified to be dragged into this controversy john is mica which is more valuable and clearer than gold he met me at pineville and we took the trolley car to his home it is a big neighbourless cottage on a hill surrounded by a hundred mountains we got off at his little private station where john s family and amaryllis met and greeted us amaryllis looked at me a trifle anxiously a rabbit came bounding across the hill between us and the house i threw down my suit case and pursued it hotfoot after i had run twenty yards and seen it disappear i sat down on the grass and wept disconsolately i can t catch a rabbit any more i sobbed i m of no further use in the world i may as well be dead oh what is it what is it brother john i heard amaryllis say nerves a little unstrung said john in his calm way don t worry get up you rabbit chaser and come on to the house before the biscuits get cold it was about twilight and the mountains came up nobly to miss murfree s descriptions of them soon after dinner i announced that i believed i could sleep for a year or two including legal holidays so i was shown to a room as big and cool as a flower garden where there was a bed as broad as a lawn soon afterward the remainder of the household retired and then there fell upon the land a silence i had not heard a silence before in years it was absolute i raised myself on my elbow and listened to it sleep i thought that if i only could hear a star twinkle or a blade of grass sharpen itself i could compose myself to rest i thought once that i heard a sound like the sail of a catboat flapping as it veered about in a breeze but i decided that it was probably only a tack in the carpet still i listened suddenly some belated little bird alighted upon the window sill and in what he no doubt considered sleepy tones enunciated the noise generally translated as cheep i leaped into the air hey what s the matter down there called john from his room above mine oh nothing i answered except that i accidentally bumped my head against the ceiling the next morning i went out on the porch and looked at the mountains there were forty seven of them in sight i shuddered went into the big hall sitting room of the house selected pancoast s family practice of medicine from a bookcase and began to read john came in took the book away from me and led me outside he has a farm of three hundred acres furnished with the usual complement of barns mules peasantry and harrows with three front teeth broken off i had seen such things in my childhood and my heart began to sink then john spoke of alfalfa and i brightened at once oh yes said i wasn t she in the chorus of let s see green you know said john and tender and you plow it under after the first season i know said i and the grass grows over her right said john you know something about farming after all i know something of some farmers said i and a sure scythe will mow them down some day on the way back to the house a beautiful and inexplicable creature walked across our path i stopped irresistibly fascinated gazing at it john waited patiently smoking his cigarette he is a modern farmer after ten minutes he said are you going to stand there looking at that chicken all day breakfast is nearly ready a chicken said i a white orpington hen if you want to particularize a white orpington hen i repeated with intense interest the fowl walked slowly away with graceful dignity and i followed like a child after the pied piper five minutes more were allowed me by john and then he took me by the sleeve and conducted me to breakfast after i had been there a week i began to grow alarmed i was sleeping and eating well and actually beginning to enjoy life for a man in my desperate condition that would never do so i sneaked down to the trolley car station took the car for pineville and went to see one of the best physicians in town by this time i knew exactly what to do when i needed medical treatment i hung my hat on the back of a chair and said rapidly doctor i have cirrhosis of the heart indurated arteries neurasthenia neuritis acute indigestion and convalescence i am going to live on a strict diet i shall also take a tepid bath at night and a cold one in the morning i shall endeavour to be cheerful and fix my mind on pleasant subjects in the way of drugs i intend to take a phosphorous pill three times a day preferably after meals and a tonic composed of the tinctures of gentian cinchona calisaya and cardamom compound into each teaspoonful of this i shall mix tincture of nux vomica beginning with one drop and increasing it a drop each day until the maximum dose is reached i shall drop this with a medicine dropper which can be procured at a trifling cost at any pharmacy good morning i took my hat and walked out after i had closed the door i remembered something that i had forgotten to say i opened it again the doctor had not moved from where he had been sitting but he gave a slightly nervous start when he saw me again i forgot to mention said i that i shall also take absolute rest and exercise after this consultation i felt much better the reestablishing in my mind of the fact that i was hopelessly ill gave me so much satisfaction that i almost became gloomy again there is nothing more alarming to a neurasthenic than to feel himself growing well and cheerful john looked after me carefully after i had evinced so much interest in his white orpington chicken he tried his best to divert my mind and was particular to lock his hen house of nights gradually the tonic mountain air the wholesome food and the daily walks among the hills so alleviated my malady that i became utterly wretched and despondent i heard of a country doctor who lived in the mountains nearby i went to see him and told him the whole story he was a gray bearded man with clear blue wr inkled eyes in a home made suit of gray jeans in order to save time i diagnosed my case touched my nose with my right forefinger struck myself below the knee to make my foot kick sounded my chest stuck out my tongue and asked him the price of cemetery lots in pineville he lit his pipe and looked at me for about three minutes brother he said after a while you are in a mighty bad way there s a chance for you to pull through but it s a mighty slim one what can it be i asked eagerly i have taken arsenic and gold phosphorus exercise nux vomica hydrotherapeutic baths rest excitement codein and aromatic spirits of ammonia is there anything left in the pharmacopoeia somewhere in these mountains said the doctor there s a plant growing a flowering plant that ll cure you and it s about the only thing that will it s of a kind that s as old as the world but of late it s powerful scarce and hard to find you and i will have to hunt it up i m not engaged in active practice now i m getting along in years but i ll take your case you ll have to come every day in the afternoon and help me hunt for this plant till we find it the city doctors may know a lot about new scientific things but they don t know much about the cures that nature carries around in her saddlebags so every day the old doctor and i hunted the cure all plant among the mountains and valleys of the blue ridge together we toiled up steep heights so slippery with fallen autumn leaves that we had to catch every sapling and branch within our reach to save us from falling we waded through gorges and chasms breast deep with laurel and ferns we followed the banks of mountain streams for miles we wound our way like indians through brakes of pine road side hill side river side mountain side we explored in our search for the miraculous plant as the old doctor said it must have grown scarce and hard to find but we followed our quest day by day we plumbed the valleys scaled the heights and tramped the plateaus in search of the miraculous plant mountain bred he never seemed to tire i often reached home too fatigued to do anything except fall into bed and sleep until morning this we kept up for a month one evening after i had returned from a six mile tramp with the old doctor amaryllis and i took a little walk under the trees near the road we looked at the mountains drawing their royal purple robes around them for their night s repose i m glad you re well again she said when you first came you frightened me i thought you were really ill well again i almost shrieked do you know that i have only one chance in a thousand to live amaryllis looked at me in surprise why said she you are as strong as one of the plough mules you sleep ten or twelve hours every night and you are eating us out of house and home what more do you want i tell you said i that unless we find the magic that is the plant we are looking for in time nothing can save me the doctor tells me so what doctor doctor tatum the old doctor who lives halfway up black oak mountain do you know him i have known him since i was able to talk and is that where you go every day is it he who takes you on these long walks and climbs that have brought back your health and strength god bless the old doctor just then the old doctor himself drove slowly down the road in his rickety old buggy i waved my hand at him and shouted that i would be on hand the next day at the usual time he stopped his horse and called to amaryllis to come out to him they talked for five minutes while i waited then the old doctor drove on when we got to the house amaryllis lugged out an encyclopaedia and sought a word in it the doctor said she told me that you needn t call any more as a patient but he d be glad to see you any time as a friend and then he told me to look up my name in the encyclopaedia and tell you what it means it seems to be the name of a genus of flowering plants and also the name of a country girl in theocritus and virgil what do you suppose the doctor meant by that i know what he meant said i i know now a word to a brother who may have come under the spell of the unquiet lady neurasthenia the formula was true even though gropingly at times the physicians of the walled cities had put their fingers upon the specific medicament and so for the exercise one is referred to good doctor tatum on black oak mountain take the road to your right at the methodist meeting house in the pine grove absolute rest and exercise what rest more remedial than to sit with amaryllis in the shade and with a sixth sense read the wordless theocritan idyl of the gold bannered blue mountains marching orderly into the dormitories of the night october and june the captain gazed gloomily at his sword that hung upon the wall in the closet near by was stored his faded uniform stained and worn by weather and service what a long long time it seemed since those old days of war s alarms and now veteran that he was of his country s strenuous times he had been reduced to abject surrender by a woman s soft eyes and smiling lips as he sat in his quiet room he held in his hand the letter he had just received from her the letter that had caused him to wear that look of gloom he re read the fatal paragraph that had destroyed his hope in declining the honour you have done me in asking me to be your wife i feel that i ought to speak frankly the reason i have for so doing is the great difference between our ages i like you very very much but i am sure that our marriage would not be a happy one i am sorry to have to refer to this but i believe that you will appreciate my honesty in giving you the true reason the captain sighed and leaned his head upon his hand yes there were many years between their ages but he was strong and rugged he had position and wealth would not his love his tender care and the advantages he could bestow upon her make her forget the question of age besides he was almost sure that she cared for him the captain was a man of prompt action in the field he had been distinguished for his decisiveness and energy he would see her and plead his cause again in person age what was it to come between him and the one he loved in two hours he stood ready in light marching order for his greatest battle he took the train for the old southern town in tennessee where she lived theodora deming was on the steps of the handsome porticoed old mansion enjoying the summer twilight when the captain entered the gate and came up the gravelled walk she met him with a smile that was free from embarrassment as the captain stood on the step below her the difference in their ages did not appear so great he was tall and straight and clear eyed and browned she was in the bloom of lovely womanhood i wasn t expecting you said theodora but now that you ve come you may sit on the step didn t you get my letter i did said the captain and that s why i came i say now theo reconsider your answer won t you theodora smiled softly upon him he carried his years well she was really fond of his strength his wholesome looks his manliness perhaps if no no she said shaking her head positively it s out of the question i like you a whole lot but marrying won t do my age and yours are but don t make me say it again i told you in my letter the captain flushed a little through the bronze on his face he was silent for a while gazing sadly into the twilight beyond a line of woods that he could see was a field where the boys in blue had once bivouacked on their march toward the sea how long ago it seemed now truly fate and father time had tricked him sorely just a few years interposed between himself and happiness theodora s hand crept down and rested in the clasp of his firm brown one she felt at least that sentiment that is akin to love don t take it so hard please she said gently it s all for the best i ve reasoned it out very wisely all by myself some day you ll be glad i didn t marry you it would be very nice and lovely for a while but just think in only a few short years what different tastes we would have one of us would want to sit by the fireside and read and maybe nurse neuralgia or rheumatism of evenings while the other would be crazy for balls and theatres and late suppers no my dear friend while it isn t exactly january and may it s a clear case of october and pretty early in june i d always do what you wanted me to do theo if you wanted to no you wouldn t you think now that you would but you wouldn t please don t ask me any more the captain had lost his battle but he was a gallant warrior and when he rose to make his final adieu his mouth was grimly set and his shoulders were squared he took the train for the north that night on the next evening he was back in his room where his sword was hanging against the wall he was dressing for dinner tying his white tie into a very careful bow and at the same time he was indulging in a pensive soliloquy pon my honour i believe theo was right after all nobody can deny that she s a peach but she must be twenty eight at the very kindest calculation for you see the captain was only nineteen and his sword had never been drawn except on the parade ground at chattanooga which was as near as he ever got to the spanish american war the church with an overshot wheel lakelands is not to be found in the catalogues of fashionable summer resorts it lies on a low spur of the cumberland range of mountains on a little tributary of the clinch river lakelands proper is a contented village of two dozen houses situated on a forlorn narrow gauge railroad line you wonder whether the railroad lost itself in the pine woods and ran into lakelands from fright and loneliness or whether lakelands got lost and huddled itself along the railroad to wait for the ears to carry it home you wonder again why it was named lakelands there are no lakes and the lands about are too poor to be worth mentioning half a mile from the village stands the eagle house a big roomy old mansion run by josiah rankin for the accommodation of visitors who desire the mountain air at inexpensive rates the eagle house is delightfully mismanaged it is full of ancient instead of modern improvements and it is altogether as comfortably neglected and pleasingly disarranged as your own home but you are furnished with clean rooms and good and abundant fare yourself and the piny woods must do the rest nature has provided a mineral spring grape vine swings and croquet even the wickets are wooden you have art to thank only for the fiddle and guitar music twice a week at the hop in the rustic pavilion the patrons of the eagle house are those who seek recreation as a necessity as well as a pleasure they are busy people who may be likened to clocks that need a fortnight s winding to insure a year s running of their wheels you will find students there from the lower towns now and then an artist or a geologist absorbed in construing the ancient strata of the hills a few quiet families spend the summers there and often one or two tired members of that patient sisterhood known to lakelands as schoolmarms a quarter of a mile from the eagle house was what would have been described to its guests as an object of interest in the catalogue had the eagle house issued a catalogue this was an old old mill that was no longer a mill in the words of josiah rankin it was the only church in the united states sah with an overshot wheel and the only mill in the world sah with pews and a pipe organ the guests of the eagle house attended the old mill church each sabbath and heard the preacher liken the purified christian to bolted flour ground to usefulness between the millstones of experience and suffering every year about the beginning of autumn there came to the eagle house one abram strong who remained for a time an honoured and beloved guest in lakelands he was called father abram because his hair was so white his face so strong and kind and florid his laugh so merry and his black clothes and broad hat so priestly in appearance even new guests after three or four days acquaintance gave him this familiar title father abram came a long way to lakelands he lived in a big roaring town in the northwest where he owned mills not little mills with pews and an organ in them but great ugly mountain like mills that the freight trains crawled around all day like ants around an ant heap and now you must be told about father abram and the mill that was a church for their stories run together in the days when the church was a mill mr strong was the miller there was no jollier dustier busier happier miller in all the land than he he lived in a little cottage across the road from the mill his hand was heavy but his toll was light and the mountaineers brought their grain to him across many weary miles of rocky roads the delight of the miller s life was his little daughter aglaia that was a brave name truly for a flaxen haired toddler but the mountaineers love sonorous and stately names the mother had encountered it somewhere in a book and the deed was done in her babyhood aglaia herself repudiated the name as far as common use went and persisted in calling herself dums the miller and his wife often tried to coax from aglaia the source of this mysterious name but without results at last they arrived at a theory in the little garden behind the cottage was a bed of rhododendrons in which the child took a peculiar delight and interest it may have been that she perceived in dums a kinship to the formidable name of her favourite flowers when aglaia was four years old she and her father used to go through a little performance in the mill every afternoon that never failed to come off the weather permitting when supper was ready her mother would brush her hair and put on a clean apron and send her across to the mill to bring her father home when the miller saw her coming in the mill door he would come forward all white with the flour dust and wave his hand and sing an old miller s song that was familiar in those parts and ran something like this the wheel goes round the grist is ground the dusty miller s merry he sings all day his work is play while thinking of his dearie then aglaia would run to him laughing and call da da come take dums home and the miller would swing her to his shoulder and march over to supper singing the miller s song every evening this would take place one day only a week after her fourth birthday aglaia disappeared when last seen she was plucking wild flowers by the side of the road in front of the cottage a little while later her mother went out to see that she did not stray too faraway and she was already gone of course every effort was made to find her the neighbours gathered and searched the woods and the mountains for miles around they dragged every foot of the mill race and the creek for a long distance below the dam never a trace of her did they find a night or two before there had been a family of wanderers camped in a grove near by it was conjectured that they might have stolen the child but when their wagon was overtaken and searched she could not be found the miller remained at the mill for nearly two years and then his hope of finding her died out he and his wife moved to the northwest in a few years he was the owner of a modern mill in one of the important milling cities in that region mrs strong never recovered from the shock caused by the loss of aglaia and two years after they moved away the miller was left to bear his sorrow alone when abram strong became prosperous he paid a visit to lakelands and the old mill the scene was a sad one for him but he was a strong man and always appeared cheery and kindly it was then that he was inspired to convert the old mill into a church lakelands was too poor to build one and the still poorer mountaineers could not assist there was no place of worship nearer than twenty miles the miller altered the appearance of the mill as little as possible the big overshot wheel was left in its place the young people who came to the church used to cut their initials in its soft and slowly decaying wood the dam was partly destroyed and the clear mountain stream rippled unchecked down its rocky bed inside the mill the changes were greater the shafts and millstones and belts and pulleys were of course all removed there were two rows of benches with aisles between and a little raised platform and pulpit at one end on three sides overhead was a gallery containing seats and reached by a stairway inside there was also an organ a real pipe organ in the gallery that was the pride of the congregation of the old mill church miss phoebe summers was the organist the lakelands boys proudly took turns at pumping it for her at each sunday s service the rev mr banbridge was the preacher and rode down from squirrel gap on his old white horse without ever missing a service and abram strong paid for everything he paid the preacher five hundred dollars a year and miss phoebe two hundred dollars thus in memory of aglaia the old mill was converted into a blessing for the community in which she had once lived it seemed that the brief life of the child had brought about more good than the three score years and ten of many but abram strong set up yet another monument to her memory out from his mills in the northwest came the aglaia flour made from the hardest and finest wheat that could be raised the country soon found out that the aglaia flour had two prices one was the highest market price and the other was nothing wherever there happened a calamity that left people destitute a fire a flood a tornado a strike or a famine there would go hurrying a generous consignment of the aglaia at its nothing price it was given away cautiously and judiciously but it was freely given and not a penny could the hungry ones pay for it there got to be a saying that whenever there was a disastrous fire in the poor districts of a city the fire chief s buggy reached the scene first next the aglaia flour wagon and then the fire engines so this was abram strong s other monument to aglaia perhaps to a poet the theme may seem too utilitarian for beauty but to some the fancy will seem sweet and fine that the pure white virgin flour flying on its mission of love and charity might be likened to the spirit of the lost child whose memory it signalized there came a year that brought hard times to the cumberlands grain crops everywhere were light and there were no local crops at all mountain floods had done much damage to property even game in the woods was so scarce that the hunters brought hardly enough home to keep their folk alive especially about lakelands was the rigour felt as soon as abram strong heard of this his messages flew and the little narrow gauge cars began to unload aglaia flour there the miller s orders were to store the flour in the gallery of the old mill church and that every one who attended the church was to carry home a sack of it two weeks after that abram strong came for his yearly visit to the eagle house and became father abram again that season the eagle house had fewer guests than usual among them was rose chester miss chester came to lakelands from atlanta where she worked in a department store this was the first vacation outing of her life the wife of the store manager had once spent a summer at the eagle house she had taken a fancy to rose and had persuaded her to go there for her three weeks holiday the manager s wife gave her a letter to mrs rankin who gladly received her in her own charge and care miss chester was not very strong she was about twenty and pale and delicate from an indoor life but one week of lakelands gave her a brightness and spirit that changed her wonderfully the time was early september when the cumberlands are at their greatest beauty the mountain foliage was growing brilliant with autumnal colours one breathed aerial champagne the nights were deliciously cool causing one to snuggle cosily under the warm blankets of the eagle house

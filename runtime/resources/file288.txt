silent trail back from it you come triumphant bearing the severed gory head of your victim which you deposit with pardonable pride in the basket at the side of your door it may be the head of your enemy your friend or a stranger according as competition jealousy or simple sportiveness has been your incentive to labor in any case your reward is certain the village men in passing stop to congratulate you as your neighbor on weaker planes of life stops to admire and praise the begonias in your front yard your particular brown maid lingers with fluttering bosom casting soft tiger s eyes at the evidence of your love for her you chew betel nut and listen content to the intermittent soft drip from the ends of the severed neck arteries and you show your teeth and grunt like a water buffalo which is as near as you can come to laughing at the thought that the cold acephalous body of your door ornament is being spotted by wheeling vultures in the mindanaoan wilds truly the life of the merry head hunter captivated me he had reduced art and philosophy to a simple code to take your adversary s head to basket it at the portal of your castle to see it lying there a dead thing with its cunning and stratagems and power gone is there a better way to foil his plots to refute his arguments to establish your superiority over his skill and wisdom the ship that brought me home was captained by an erratic swede who changed his course and deposited me with genuine compassion in a small town on the pacific coast of one of the central american republics a few hundred miles south of the port to which he had engaged to convey me but i was wearied of movement and exotic fancies so i leaped contentedly upon the firm sands of the village of mojada telling myself i should be sure to find there the rest that i craved after all far better to linger there i thought lulled by the sedative plash of the waves and the rustling of palm fronds than to sit upon the horsehair sofa of my parental home in the east and there cast down by currant wine and cake and scourged by fatuous relatives drivel into the ears of gaping neighbors sad stories of the death of colonial governors when i first saw chloe greene she was standing all in white in the doorway of her father s tile roofed dobe house she was polishing a silver cup with a cloth and she looked like a pearl laid against black velvet she turned on me a flatteringly protracted but a wiltingly disapproving gaze and then went inside humming a light song to indicate the value she placed upon my existence small wonder for dr stamford the most disreputable professional man between juneau and valparaiso and i were zigzagging along the turfy street tunelessly singing the words of auld lang syne to the air of muzzer s little coal black coon we had come from the ice factory which was mojada s palace of wickedness where we had been playing billiards and opening black bottles white with frost that we dragged with strings out of old sandoval s ice cold vats i turned in sudden rage to dr stamford as sober as the verger of a cathedral in a moment i had become aware that we were swine cast before a pearl you beast i said this is half your doing and the other half is the fault of this cursed country i d better have gone back to sleepy town and died in a wild orgy of currant wine and buns than to have had this happen stamford filled the empty street with his roaring laughter you too he cried and all as quick as the popping of a cork well she does seem to strike agreeably upon the retina but don t burn your fingers all mojada will tell you that louis devoe is the man we will see about that said i and perhaps whether he is a man as well as the man i lost no time in meeting louis devoe that was easily accomplished for the foreign colony in mojada numbered scarce a dozen and they gathered daily at a half decent hotel kept by a turk where they managed to patch together the fluttering rags of country and civilization that were left them i sought devoe before i did my pearl of the doorway because i had learned a little of the game of war and knew better than to strike for a prize before testing the strength of the enemy a sort of cold dismay something akin to fear filled me when i had estimated him i found a man so perfectly poised so charming so deeply learned in the world s rituals so full of tact courtesy and hospitality so endowed with grace and ease and a kind of careless haughty power that i almost overstepped the bounds in probing him in turning him on the spit to find the weak point that i so craved for him to have but i left him whole i had to make bitter acknowledgment to myself that louis devoe was a gentleman worthy of my best blows and i swore to give him them he was a great merchant of the country a wealthy importer and exporter all day he sat in a fastidiously appointed office surrounded by works of art and evidences of his high culture directing through glass doors and windows the affairs of his house in person he was slender and hardly tall his small well shaped head was covered with thick brown hair trimmed short and he wore a thick brown beard also cut close and

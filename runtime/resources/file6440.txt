leaned back against the wall and held his glass up to the light we ve come now said he to the question of how far you re willing to go in a little matter of the sort i told you why i came down here

time in a little safe that you could open with a shoe buttoner get it my skill as a tattooer is worth half the boddle we go halves and catch a tramp steamer for rio janeiro let the united states go to pieces if it can t get along without my services que dice senor it sounds to me said the kid nodding his head i m out for the dust all right then said thacker you ll have to keep close until we get the bird on you you can live in the back room here i do my own cooking and i ll make you as comfortable as a parsimonious government will allow me thacker had set the time at a week but it was two weeks before the design that he patiently tattooed upon the kid s hand was to his notion and then thacker called a muchacho and dispatched this note to the intended victim el senor don santos urique la casa blanca my dear sir i beg permission to inform you that there is in my house as a temporary guest a young man who arrived in buenas tierras from the united states some days ago without wishing to excite any hopes that may not be realized i think there is a possibility of his being your long absent son it might be well for you to call and see him if he is it is my opinion that his intention was to return to his home but upon arriving here his courage failed him from doubts as to how he would be received your true servant thompson thacker half an hour afterward quick time for buenas tierras senor urique s ancient landau drove to the consul s door with the barefooted coachman beating and shouting at the team of fat awkward horses a tall man with a white moustache alighted and assisted to the ground a lady who was dressed and veiled in unrelieved black the two hastened inside and were met by thacker with his best diplomatic bow by his desk stood a slender young man with clear cut sun browned features and smoothly brushed black hair senora urique threw back her black veil with a quick gesture she was past middle age and her hair was beginning to silver but her full proud figure and clear olive skin retained traces of the beauty peculiar to the basque province but once you had seen her eyes and comprehended the great sadness that was revealed in their deep shadows and hopeless expression you saw that the woman lived only in some memory she bent upon the young man a long look of the most agonized questioning then her great black eyes turned and her gaze rested upon his left hand and then with a sob not loud but seeming to shake the room she cried hijo mio and caught the llano kid to her heart a month afterward the kid came to the consulate in response to a message sent by thacker he looked the young spanish caballero his clothes were imported and the wiles of the jewellers had not been spent upon him in vain a more than respectable diamond shone on his finger as he rolled a shuck cigarette what s doing asked thacker nothing much said the kid calmly i eat my first iguana steak to day they re them big lizards you sabe i reckon though that frijoles and side bacon would do me about as well do you care for iguanas thacker no nor for some other kinds of reptiles said thacker it was three in the afternoon and in another hour he would be in his state of beatitude it s time you were making good sonny he went on with an ugly look on his reddened face you re not playing up to me square you ve been the prodigal son for four weeks now and you could have had veal for every meal on a gold dish if you d wanted it now mr kid do you think it s right to leave me out so long on a husk diet what s the trouble don t you get your filial eyes on anything that looks like cash in the casa blanca don t tell me you don t everybody knows where old urique keeps his stuff it s u s currency too he don t accept anything else what s doing don t say nothing this time why sure said the kid admiring his diamond there s plenty of money up there i m no judge of collateral in bunches but i will undertake for to say that i ve seen the rise of at a time in that tin grub box that my adopted father calls his safe and he lets me carry the key sometimes just to show me that he knows i m the real francisco that strayed from the herd a long time ago well what are you waiting for asked thacker angrily don t you forget that i can upset your apple cart any day i want to if old urique knew you were an imposter what sort of things would happen to you oh you don t know this country mr texas kid the laws here have got mustard spread between em these people here d stretch you out like a frog that had been stepped on and give you about fifty sticks at every corner of the plaza and they d wear every stick out too what was left of you they d feed to alligators i might just as well tell you now pardner said the kid sliding down low on his steamer chair that things are going to stay just as they are they re about right now what do you mean asked thacker rattling the bottom of his glass on his desk the scheme s off said the kid and whenever you have the pleasure of speaking to me address me as don francisco urique i ll guarantee i ll answer to it we ll let colonel urique keep his money his little tin safe is as good as the time locker in the first national bank of laredo as far as you and me are concerned you re going to throw me down then are you said the consul sure said the kid cheerfully throw you down that s it and now i ll tell you why the first night i was up at the colonel s house they introduced me to a bedroom no blankets on the floor a real room with a bed and things in it and before i was asleep in comes this artificial mother and tucks in the covers panchito she says my little lost one god has brought you back to me i bless his name forever it was that or some truck like that she said and down comes a drop or two of rain and hits me on the nose and all that stuck by me mr thacker and it s been that way ever since and it s got to stay that way don t you think that it s for what s in it for me either that i say so if you have any such ideas keep em to yourself i haven t had much truck with women in my life and no mothers to speak of but here s a lady that we ve got to keep fooled once she stood it twice she won t i m a low down wolf and the devil may have sent me on this trail instead of god but i ll travel it to the end and now don t forget that i m don francisco urique whenever you happen to mention my name i ll expose you to day you you double dyed traitor stammered thacker the kid arose and without violence took thacker by the throat with a hand of steel and shoved him slowly into a corner then he drew from under his left arm his pearl handled and poked the cold muzzle of it against the consul s mouth i told you why i come here he said with his old freezing smile if i leave here you ll be the reason never forget it pardner now what is my name er don francisco urique gasped thacker from outside came a sound of wheels and the shouting of some one and the sharp thwacks of a wooden whipstock upon the backs of fat horses the kid put up his gun and walked toward the door but he turned again and came back to the trembling thacker and held up his left hand with its back toward the consul there s one more reason he said slowly why things have got to stand as they are the fellow i killed in laredo had one of them same pictures on his left hand outside the ancient landau of don santos urique rattled to the door the coachman ceased his bellowing senora urique in a voluminous gay gown of white lace and flying ribbons leaned forward with a happy look in her great soft eyes are you within dear son she called in the rippling castilian madre mia yo vengo mother i come answered the young don francisco urique the passing of black eagle for some months of a certain year a grim bandit infested the texas border along the rio grande peculiarly striking to the optic nerve was this notorious marauder his personality secured him the title of black eagle the terror of the border many fearsome tales are on record concerning the doings of him and his followers suddenly in the space of a single minute black eagle vanished from earth he was never heard of again his own band never even guessed the mystery of his disappearance the border ranches and settlements feared he would come again to ride and ravage the mesquite flats he never will it is to disclose the fate of black eagle that this narrative is written the initial movement of the story is furnished by the foot of a bartender in st louis his discerning eye fell upon the form of chicken ruggles as he pecked with avidity at the free lunch chicken was a hobo he had a long nose like the bill of a fowl an inordinate appetite for poultry and a habit of gratifying it without expense which accounts for the name given him by his fellow vagrants physicians agree that the partaking of liquids at meal times is not a healthy practice the hygiene of the saloon promulgates the opposite chicken had neglected to purchase a drink to accompany his meal the bartender rounded the counter caught the injudicious diner by the ear with a lemon squeezer led him to the door and kicked him into the street thus the mind of chicken was brought to realize the signs of coming winter the night was cold the stars shone with unkindly brilliancy people were hurrying along the streets in two egotistic jostling streams men had donned their overcoats and chicken knew to an exact percentage the increased difficulty of coaxing dimes from those buttoned in vest pockets the time had come for his annual exodus to the south a little boy five or six years old stood looking with covetous eyes in a confectioner s window in one small hand he held an empty two ounce vial in the other he grasped tightly something flat and round with a shining milled edge the scene presented a field of operations commensurate to chicken s talents and daring after sweeping the horizon to make sure that no official tug was cruising near he insidiously accosted his prey the boy having been early taught by his household to regard altruistic advances with extreme suspicion received the overtures coldly then chicken knew that he must make one of those desperate nerve shattering plunges into speculation that fortune sometimes requires of those who would win her favour five cents was his capital and this he must risk against the chance of winning what lay within the close grasp of the youngster s chubby hand it was a fearful lottery chicken knew but he must accomplish his end by strategy since he had a wholesome terror of plundering infants by force once in a park driven by hunger he had committed an onslaught upon a bottle of peptonized infant s food in the possession of an occupant of a baby carriage the outraged infant had so promptly opened its mouth and pressed the button that communicated with the welkin that help arrived and chicken did his thirty days in a snug coop wherefore he was as he said leary of kids beginning artfully to question the boy concerning his choice of sweets he gradually drew out the information he wanted mamma said he was to ask the drug store man for ten cents worth of paregoric in the bottle he was to keep his hand shut tight over the dollar he must not stop to talk to anyone in the street he must ask the drug store man to wrap up the change and put it in the pocket of his trousers indeed they had pockets two of them and he liked chocolate creams best chicken went into the store and turned plunger he invested his entire capital in c a n d y stocks simply to pave the way to the greater risk following he gave the sweets to the youngster and had the satisfaction of perceiving that confidence was established after that it was easy to obtain leadership of the expedition to take the investment by the hand and lead it to a nice drug store he knew of in the same block there chicken with a parental air passed over the dollar and called for the medicine while the boy crunched his candy glad to be relieved of the responsibility of the purchase and then the successful investor searching his pockets found an overcoat button the extent of his winter trousseau and wrapping it carefully placed the ostensible change in the pocket of confiding juvenility setting the youngster s face homeward and patting him benevolently on the back for chicken s heart was as soft as those of his feathered namesakes the speculator quit the market with a profit of per cent on his invested capital two hours later an iron mountain freight engine pulled out of the railroad yards texas bound with a string of empties in one of the cattle cars half buried in excelsior chicken lay at ease beside him in his nest was a quart bottle of very poor whisky and a paper bag of bread and cheese mr ruggles in his private car was on his trip south for the winter season for a week that car was trundled southward shifted laid over and manipulated after the manner of rolling stock but chicken stuck to it leaving it only at necessary times to satisfy his hunger and thirst he knew it must go down to the cattle country and san antonio in the heart of it was his goal there the air was salubrious and mild the people indulgent and long suffering the bartenders there would not kick him if he should eat too long or too often at one place they would swear at him as if by rote and without heat they swore so drawlingly and they rarely paused short of their full vocabulary which was copious so that chicken had often gulped a good meal during the process of the vituperative prohibition the season there was always spring like the plazas were pleasant at night with music and gaiety except during the slight and infrequent cold snaps one could sleep comfortably out of doors in case the interiors should develop inhospitability at texarkana his car was switched to the i and g n then still southward it trailed until at length it crawled across the colorado bridge at austin and lined out straight as an arrow for the run to san antonio when the freight halted at that town chicken was fast asleep in ten minutes the train was off again for laredo the end of the road those empty cattle cars were for distribution along the line at points from which the ranches shipped their stock when chicken awoke his car was stationary looking out between the slats he saw it was a bright moonlit night scrambling out he saw his car with three others abandoned on a little siding in a wild and lonesome country a cattle pen and chute stood on one side of the track the railroad bisected a vast dim ocean of prairie in the midst of which chicken with his futile rolling stock was as completely stranded as was robinson with his land locked boat a white post stood near the rails going up to it chicken read the letters at the top s a laredo was nearly as far to the south he was almost a hundred miles from any town coyotes began to yelp in the mysterious sea around him chicken felt lonesome he had lived in boston without an education in chicago without nerve in philadelphia without a sleeping place in new york without a pull and in pittsburg sober and yet he had never felt so lonely as now suddenly through the intense silence he heard the whicker of a horse the sound came from the side of the track toward the east and chicken began to explore timorously in that direction he stepped high along the mat of curly mesquit grass for he was afraid of everything there might be in this wilderness snakes rats brigands centipedes mirages cowboys fandangoes tarantulas tamales he had read of them in the story papers rounding a clump of prickly pear that reared high its fantastic and menacing array of rounded heads he was struck to shivering terror by a snort and a thunderous plunge as the horse himself startled bounded away some fifty yards and then resumed his grazing but here was the one thing in the desert that chicken did not fear he had been reared on a farm he had handled horses understood them and could ride approaching slowly and speaking soothingly he followed the animal which after its first flight seemed gentle enough and secured the end of the twenty foot lariat that dragged after him in the grass it required him but a few moments to contrive the rope into an ingenious nose bridle after the style of the mexican borsal in another he was upon the horse s back and off at a splendid lope giving the animal free choice of direction he will take me somewhere said chicken to himself it would have been a thing of joy that untrammelled gallop over the moonlit prairie even to chicken who loathed exertion but that his mood was not for it his head ached a growing thirst was upon him the somewhere whither his lucky mount might convey him was full of dismal peradventure and now he noted that the horse moved to a definite goal where the prairie lay smooth he kept his course straight as an arrow s toward the east deflected by hill or arroyo or impractical spinous brakes he quickly flowed again into the current charted by his unerring instinct at last upon the side of a gentle rise he suddenly subsided to a complacent walk a stone s cast away stood a little mott of coma trees beneath it a jacal such as the mexicans erect a one room house of upright poles daubed with clay and roofed with grass or tule reeds an experienced eye would have estimated the spot as the headquarters of a small sheep ranch in the moonlight the ground in the nearby corral showed pulverized to a level smoothness by the hoofs of the sheep everywhere was carelessly distributed the paraphernalia of the place ropes bridles saddles sheep pelts wool sacks feed troughs and camp litter the barrel of drinking water stood in the end of the two horse wagon near the door the harness was piled promiscuous upon the wagon tongue soaking up the dew chicken slipped to earth and tied the horse to a tree he halloed again and again but the house remained quiet the door stood open and he entered cautiously the light was sufficient for him to see that no one was at home the room was that of a bachelor ranchman who was content with the necessaries of life chicken rummaged intelligently until he found what he had hardly dared hope for a small brown jug that still contained something near a quart of his desire half an hour later chicken now a gamecock of hostile aspect emerged from the house with unsteady steps he had drawn upon the absent ranchman s equipment to replace his own ragged attire he wore a suit of coarse brown ducking the coat being a sort of rakish bolero jaunty to a degree boots he had donned and spurs that whirred with every lurching step buckled around him was a belt full of cartridges with a big six shooter in each of its two holsters prowling about he found blankets a saddle and bridle with which he caparisoned his steed again mounting he rode swiftly away singing a loud and tuneless song bud king s band of desperadoes outlaws and horse and cattle thieves were in camp at a secluded spot on the bank of the frio their depredations in the rio grande country while no bolder than usual had been advertised more extensively and captain kinney s company of rangers had been ordered down to look after them consequently bud king who was a wise general instead of cutting out a hot trail for the upholders of the law as his men wished to do retired for the time to the prickly fastnesses of the frio valley though the move was a prudent one and not incompatible with bud s well known courage it raised dissension among the members of the band in fact while they thus lay ingloriously perdu in the brush the question of bud king s fitness for the leadership was argued with closed doors as it were by his followers never before had bud s skill or efficiency been brought to criticism but his glory was wandering and such is glory s fate in the light of a newer star the sentiment of the band was crystallizing into the opinion that black eagle could lead them with more lustre profit and distinction this black eagle sub titled the terror of the border had been a member of the gang about three months one night while they were in camp on the san miguel water hole a solitary horseman on the regulation fiery steed dashed in among them the newcomer was of a portentous and devastating aspect a beak like nose with a predatory curve projected above a mass of bristling blue black whiskers his eye was cavernous and fierce he was spurred sombreroed booted garnished with revolvers abundantly drunk and very much unafraid few people in the country drained by the rio bravo would have cared thus to invade alone the camp of bud king but this fell bird swooped fearlessly upon them and demanded to be fed hospitality in the prairie country is not limited even if your enemy pass your way you must feed him before you shoot him you must empty your larder into him before you empty your lead so the stranger of undeclared intentions was set down to a mighty feast a talkative bird he was full of most marvellous loud tales and exploits and speaking a language at times obscure but never colourless he was a new sensation to bud king s men who rarely encountered new types they hung delighted upon his vainglorious boasting the spicy strangeness of his lingo his contemptuous familiarity with life the world and remote places and the extravagant frankness with which he conveyed his sentiments to their guest the band of outlaws seemed to be nothing more than a congregation of country bumpkins whom he was stringing for grub just as he would have told his stories at the back door of a farmhouse to wheedle a meal and indeed his ignorance was not without excuse for the bad man of the southwest does not run to extremes those brigands might justly have been taken for a little party of peaceable rustics assembled for a fish fry or pecan gathering gentle of manner slouching of gait soft voiced unpicturesquely clothed not one of them presented to the eye any witness of the desperate records they had earned for two days the glittering stranger within the camp was feasted then by common consent he was invited to become a member of the band he consented presenting for enrollment the prodigious name of captain montressor this name was immediately overruled by the band and piggy substituted as a compliment to the awful and insatiate appetite of its owner thus did the texas border receive the most spectacular brigand that ever rode its chaparral for the next three months bud king conducted business as usual escaping encounters with law officers and being content with reasonable profits the band ran off some very good companies of horses from the ranges and a few bunches of fine cattle which they got safely across the rio grande and disposed of to fair advantage often the band would ride into the little villages and mexican settlements terrorizing the inhabitants and plundering for the provisions and ammunition they needed it was during these bloodless raids that piggy s ferocious aspect and frightful voice gained him a renown more widespread and glorious than those other gentle voiced and sad faced desperadoes could have acquired in a lifetime the mexicans most apt in nomenclature first called him the black eagle and used to frighten the babes by threatening them with tales of the dreadful robber who carried off little children in his great beak soon the name extended and black eagle the terror of the border became a recognized factor in exaggerated newspaper reports and ranch gossip the country from the nueces to the rio grande was a wild but fertile stretch given over to the sheep and cattle ranches range was free the inhabitants were few the law was mainly a letter and the pirates met with little opposition until the flaunting and garish piggy gave the band undue advertisement then mckinney s ranger company headed for those precincts and bud king knew that it meant grim and sudden war or else temporary retirement regarding the risk to be unnecessary he drew off his band to an almost inaccessible spot on the bank of the frio wherefore as has been said dissatisfaction arose among the members and impeachment proceedings against bud were premeditated with black eagle in high favour for the succession bud king was not unaware of the sentiment and he called aside cactus taylor his trusted lieutenant to discuss it if the boys said bud ain t satisfied with me i m willing to step out they re buckin against my way of handlin em and specially because i concludes to hit the brush while sam kinney is ridin the line i saves em from bein shot or sent up on a state contract and they up and says i m no good it ain t so much that explained cactus as it is they re plum locoed about piggy they want them whiskers and that nose of his to split the wind at the head of the column there s somethin mighty seldom about piggy declared bud musingly i never yet see anything on the hoof that he exactly grades up with he can shore holler a plenty and he straddles a hoss from where you laid the chunk but he ain t never been smoked yet you know cactus we ain t had a row since he s been with us piggy s all right for skearin the greaser kids and layin waste a cross roads store i reckon he s the finest canned oyster buccaneer and cheese pirate that ever was but how s his appetite for fightin i ve knowed some citizens you d think was starvin for trouble get a bad case of dyspepsy the first dose of lead they had to take he talks all spraddled out said cactus bout the rookuses he s been in he claims to have saw the elephant and hearn the owl i know replied bud using the cowpuncher s expressive phrase of skepticism but it sounds to me this conversation was held one night in camp while the other members of the band eight in number were sprawling around the fire lingering over their supper when bud and cactus ceased talking they heard piggy s formidable voice holding forth to the others as usual while he was engaged in checking though never satisfying his ravening appetite wat s de use he was saying of chasin little red cowses and hosses round for t ousands of miles dere ain t nuttin in it gallopin t rough dese bushes and briers and gettin a t irst dat a brewery couldn t put out and missin meals say you know what i d do if i was main finger of dis bunch i d stick up a train i d blow de express car and make hard dollars where you guys get wind youse makes me tired dis sook cow kind of cheap sport gives me a pain later on a deputation waited on bud they stood on one leg chewed mesquit twigs and circumlocuted for they hated to hurt his feelings bud foresaw their business and made it easy for them bigger risks and larger profits was what they wanted the suggestion of piggy s about holding up a train had fired their imagination and increased their admiration for the dash and boldness of the instigator they were such simple artless and custom bound bush rangers that they had never before thought of extending their habits beyond the running off of live stock and the shooting of such of their acquaintances as ventured to interfere bud acted on the level agreeing to take a subordinate place in the gang until black eagle should have been given a trial as leader after a great deal of consultation studying of time tables and discussion of the country s topography the time and place for carrying out their new enterprise was decided upon at that time there was a feedstuff famine in mexico and a cattle famine in certain parts of the united states and there was a brisk international trade much money was being shipped along the railroads that connected the two republics it was agreed that the most promising place for the contemplated robbery was at espina a little station on the i and g n about forty miles north of laredo the train stopped there one minute the country around was wild and unsettled the station consisted of but one house in which the agent lived black eagle s band set out riding by night arriving in the vicinity of espina they rested their horses all day in a thicket a few miles distant the train was due at espina at p m they could rob the train and be well over the mexican border with their booty by daylight the next morning to do black eagle justice he exhibited no signs of flinching from the responsible honours that had been conferred upon him he assigned his men to their respective posts with discretion and coached them carefully as to their duties on each side of the track four of the band were to lie concealed in the chaparral gotch ear rodgers was to stick up the station agent bronco charlie was to remain with the horses holding them in readiness at a spot where it was calculated the engine would be when the train stopped bud king was to lie hidden on one side and black eagle himself on the other the two would get the drop on the engineer and fireman force them to descend and proceed to the rear then the express car would be looted and the escape made no one was to move until black eagle gave the signal by firing his revolver the plan was perfect at ten minutes to train time every man was at his post effectually concealed by the thick chaparral that grew almost to the rails the night was dark and lowering with a fine drizzle falling from the flying gulf clouds black eagle crouched behind a bush within five yards of the track two six shooters were belted around him occasionally he drew a large black bottle from his pocket and raised it to his mouth a star appeared far down the track which soon waxed into the headlight of the approaching train it came on with an increasing roar the engine bore down upon the ambushing desperadoes with a glare and a shriek like some avenging monster come to deliver them to justice black eagle flattened himself upon the ground the engine contrary to their calculations instead of stopping between him and bud king s place of concealment passed fully forty years farther before it came to a stand the bandit leader rose to his feet and peered through the bush his men all lay quiet awaiting the signal immediately opposite black eagle was a thing that drew his attention instead of being a regular passenger train it was a mixed one before him stood a box car the door of which by some means had been left slightly open black eagle went up to it and pushed the door farther open an odour came forth a damp rancid familiar musty intoxicating beloved odour stirring strongly at old memories of happy days and travels black eagle sniffed at the witching smell as the returned wanderer smells of the rose that twines his boyhood s cottage home nostalgia seized him he put his hand inside excelsior dry springy curly soft enticing covered the floor outside the drizzle had turned to a chilling rain the train bell clanged the bandit chief unbuckled his belt and cast it with its revolvers upon the ground his spurs followed quickly and his broad sombrero black eagle was moulting the train started with a rattling jerk the ex terror of the border scrambled into the box car and closed the door stretched luxuriously upon the excelsior with the black bottle clasped closely to his breast his eyes closed and a foolish happy smile upon his terrible features chicken ruggles started upon his return trip undisturbed with the band of desperate bandits lying motionless awaiting the signal to attack the train pulled out from espina as its speed increased and the black masses of chaparral went whizzing past on either side the express messenger lighting his pipe looked through his window and remarked feelingly what a jim dandy place for a hold up a retrieved reformation a guard came to the prison shoe shop where jimmy valentine was assiduously stitching uppers and escorted him to the front office there the warden handed jimmy his pardon which had been signed that morning by the governor jimmy took it in a tired kind of way he had served nearly ten months of a four year sentence he had expected to stay only about three months at the longest when a man with as many friends on the outside as jimmy valentine had is received in the stir it is hardly worth while to cut his hair now valentine said the warden you ll go out in the morning brace up and make a man of yourself you re not a bad fellow at heart stop cracking safes and live straight me said jimmy in surprise why i never cracked a safe in my life oh no laughed the warden of course not let s see now how was it you happened to get sent up on that springfield job was it because you wouldn t prove an alibi for fear of compromising somebody in extremely high toned society or was it simply a case of a mean old jury that had it in for you it s always one or the other with you innocent victims me said jimmy still blankly virtuous why warden i never was in springfield in my life take him back cronin said the warden and fix him up with outgoing clothes unlock him at seven in the morning and let him come to the bull pen better think over my advice valentine at a quarter past seven on the next morning jimmy stood in the warden s outer office he had on a suit of the villainously fitting ready made clothes and a pair of the stiff squeaky shoes that the state furnishes to its discharged compulsory guests the clerk handed him a railroad ticket and the five dollar bill with which the law expected him to rehabilitate himself into good citizenship and prosperity the warden gave him a cigar and shook hands valentine was chronicled on the books pardoned by governor and mr james valentine walked out into the sunshine disregarding the song of the birds the waving green trees and the smell of the flowers jimmy headed straight for a restaurant there he tasted the first sweet joys of liberty in the shape of a broiled chicken and a bottle of white wine followed by a cigar a grade better than the one the warden had given him from there he proceeded leisurely to the depot he tossed a quarter into the hat of a blind man sitting by the door and boarded his train three hours set him down in a little town near the state line he went to the cafe of one mike dolan and shook hands with mike who was alone behind the bar sorry we couldn t make it sooner jimmy me boy said mike but we had that protest from springfield to buck against and the governor nearly balked feeling all right fine said jimmy got my key he got his key and went upstairs unlocking the door of a room at the rear everything was just as he had left it there on the floor was still ben price s collar button that had been torn from that eminent detective s shirt band when they had overpowered jimmy to arrest him pulling out from the wall a folding bed jimmy slid back a panel in the wall and dragged out a dust covered suit case he opened this and gazed fondly at the finest set of burglar s tools in the east it was a complete set made of specially tempered steel the latest designs in drills punches braces and bits jimmies clamps and augers with two or three novelties invented by jimmy himself in which he took pride over nine hundred dollars they had cost him to have made at a place where they make such things for the profession in half an hour jimmy went down stairs and through the cafe he was now dressed in tasteful and well fitting clothes and carried his dusted and cleaned suit case in his hand got anything on asked mike dolan genially me said jimmy in a puzzled tone i don t understand i m representing the new york amalgamated short snap biscuit cracker and frazzled wheat company this statement delighted mike to such an extent that jimmy had to take a seltzer and milk on the spot he never touched hard drinks a week after the release of valentine there was a neat job of safe burglary done in richmond indiana with no clue to the author a scant eight hundred dollars was all that was secured two weeks after that a patented improved burglar proof safe in logansport was opened like a cheese to the tune of fifteen hundred dollars currency securities and silver untouched that began to interest the rogue catchers then an old fashioned bank safe in jefferson city became active and threw out of its crater an eruption of bank notes amounting to five thousand dollars the losses were now high enough to bring the matter up into ben price s class of work by comparing notes a remarkable similarity in the methods of the burglaries was noticed ben price investigated the scenes of the robberies and was heard to remark that s dandy jim valentine s autograph he s resumed business look at that combination knob jerked out as easy as pulling up a radish in wet weather he s got the only clamps that can do it and look how clean those tumblers were punched out jimmy never has to drill but one hole yes i guess i want mr valentine he ll do his bit next time without any short time or clemency foolishness ben price knew jimmy s habits he had learned them while working on the springfield case long jumps quick get aways no confederates and a taste for good society these ways had helped mr valentine to become noted as a successful dodger of retribution it was given out that ben price had taken up the trail of the elusive cracksman and other people with burglar proof safes felt more at ease one afternoon jimmy valentine and his suit case climbed out of the mail hack in elmore a little town five miles off the railroad down in the black jack country of arkansas jimmy looking like an athletic young senior just home from college went down the board side walk toward the hotel a young lady crossed the street passed him at the corner and entered a door over which was the sign the elmore bank jimmy valentine looked into her eyes forgot what he was and became another man she lowered her eyes and coloured slightly young men of jimmy s style and looks were scarce in elmore jimmy collared a boy that was loafing on the steps of the bank as if he were one of the stockholders and began to ask him questions about the town feeding him dimes at intervals by and by the young lady came out looking royally unconscious of the young man with the suit case and went her way isn that young lady polly simpson asked jimmy with specious guile naw said the boy she s annabel adams her pa owns this bank why d you come to elmore for is that a gold watch chain i m going to get a bulldog got any more dimes jimmy went to the planters hotel registered as ralph d spencer and engaged a room he leaned on the desk and declared his platform to the clerk he said he had come to elmore to look for a location to go into business how was the shoe business now in the town he had thought of the shoe business was there an opening the clerk was impressed by the clothes and manner of jimmy he himself was something of a pattern of fashion to the thinly gilded youth of elmore but he now perceived his shortcomings while trying to figure out jimmy s manner of tying his four in hand he cordially gave information yes there ought to be a good opening in the shoe line there wasn t an exclusive shoe store in the place the dry goods and general stores handled them business in all lines was fairly good hoped mr spencer would decide to locate in elmore he would find it a pleasant town to live in and the people very sociable mr spencer thought he would stop over in the town a few days and look over the situation no the clerk needn t call the boy he would carry up his suit case himself it was rather heavy mr ralph spencer the phoenix that arose from jimmy valentine s ashes ashes left by the flame of a sudden and alterative attack of love remained in elmore and prospered he opened a shoe store and secured a good run of trade socially he was also a success and made many friends and he accomplished the wish of his heart he met miss annabel adams and became more and more captivated by her charms at the end of a year the situation of mr ralph spencer was this he had won the respect of the community his shoe store was flourishing and he and annabel were engaged to be married in two weeks mr adams the typical plodding country banker approved of spencer annabel s pride in him almost equalled her affection he was as much at home in the family of mr adams and that of annabel s married sister as if he were already a member one day jimmy sat down in his room and wrote this letter which he mailed to the safe address of one of his old friends in st louis dear old pal

in a livery buggy he lounged about town in his quiet way until he found out what he wanted to know from the drug store across the street from spencer s shoe store he got a good look at ralph d spencer going to marry the banker s daughter are you jimmy said ben to himself softly well i don t know the next morning jimmy took breakfast at the adamses he was going to little rock that day to order his wedding suit and buy something nice for annabel that would be the first time he had left town since he came to elmore it had been more than a year now since those last professional jobs and he thought he could safely venture out after breakfast quite a family party went downtown together mr adams annabel jimmy and annabel s married sister with her two little girls aged five and nine they came by the hotel where jimmy still boarded and he ran up to his room and brought along his suit case then they went on to the bank there stood jimmy s horse and buggy and dolph gibson who was going to drive him over to the railroad station all went inside the high carved oak railings into the banking room jimmy included for mr adams s future son in law was welcome anywhere the clerks were pleased to be greeted by the good looking agreeable young man who was going to marry miss annabel jimmy set his suit case down annabel whose heart was bubbling with happiness and lively youth put on jimmy s hat and picked up the suit case wouldn t i make a nice drummer said annabel my ralph how heavy it is feels like it was full of gold bricks lot of nickel plated shoe horns in there said jimmy coolly that i m going to return thought i d save express charges by taking them up i m getting awfully economical the elmore bank had just put in a new safe and vault mr adams was very proud of it and insisted on an inspection by every one the vault was a small one but it had a new patented door it fastened with three solid steel bolts thrown simultaneously with a single handle and had a time lock mr adams beamingly explained its workings to mr spencer who showed a courteous but not too intelligent interest the two children may and agatha were delighted by the shining metal and funny clock and knobs while they were thus engaged ben price sauntered in and leaned on his elbow looking casually inside between the railings he told the teller that he didn t want anything he was just waiting for a man he knew suddenly there was a scream or two from the women and a commotion unperceived by the elders may the nine year old girl in a spirit of play had shut agatha in the vault she had then shot the bolts and turned the knob of the combination as she had seen mr adams do the old banker sprang to the handle and tugged at it for a moment the door can t be opened he groaned the clock hasn t been wound nor the combination set agatha s mother screamed again hysterically hush said mr adams raising his trembling hand all be quite for a moment agatha he called as loudly as he could listen to me during the following silence they could just hear the faint sound of the child wildly shrieking in the dark vault in a panic of terror my precious darling wailed the mother she will die of fright open the door oh break it open can t you men do something there isn t a man nearer than little rock who can open that door said mr adams in a shaky voice my god spencer what shall we do that child she can t stand it long in there there isn t enough air and besides she ll go into convulsions from fright agatha s mother frantic now beat the door of the vault with her hands somebody wildly suggested dynamite annabel turned to jimmy her large eyes full of anguish but not yet despairing to a woman nothing seems quite impossible to the powers of the man she worships can t you do something ralph try won t you he looked at her with a queer soft smile on his lips and in his keen eyes annabel he said give me that rose you are wearing will you hardly believing that she heard him aright she unpinned the bud from the bosom of her dress and placed it in his hand jimmy stuffed it into his vest pocket threw off his coat and pulled up his shirt sleeves with that act ralph d spencer passed away and jimmy valentine took his place get away from the door all of you he commanded shortly he set his suit case on the table and opened it out flat from that time on he seemed to be unconscious of the presence of any one else he laid out the shining queer implements swiftly and orderly whistling softly to himself as he always did when at work in a deep silence and immovable the others watched him as if under a spell in a minute jimmy s pet drill was biting smoothly into the steel door in ten minutes breaking his own burglarious record he threw back the bolts and opened the door agatha almost collapsed but safe was gathered into her mother s arms jimmy valentine put on his coat and walked outside the railings towards the front door as he went he thought he heard a far away voice that he once knew call ralph but he never hesitated at the door a big man stood somewhat in his way hello ben said jimmy still with his strange smile got around at last have you well let s go i don t know that it makes much difference now and then ben price acted rather strangely guess you re mistaken mr spencer he said don t believe i recognize you your buggy s waiting for you ain t it and ben price turned and strolled down the street cherchez la femme robbins reporter for the picayune and dumars of l abeille the old french newspaper that has buzzed for nearly a century were good friends well proven by years of ups and downs together they were seated where they had a habit of meeting in the little creole haunted cafe of madame tibault in dumaine street if you know the place you will experience a thrill of pleasure in recalling it to mind it is small and dark with six little polished tables at which you may sit and drink the best coffee in new orleans and concoctions of absinthe equal to sazerac s best madame tibault fat and indulgent presides at the desk and takes your money nicolette and meme madame s nieces in charming bib aprons bring the desirable beverages dumars with

auction at three o clock this afternoon there will be sold to the highest bidder all the common property of the little sisters of samaria at the home of the sisterhood in bonhomme street the sale will dispose of the building ground and the complete furnishings of the house and chapel without reserve this notice stirred the two friends to a reminiscent talk concerning an episode in their journalistic career that had occurred about two years before they recalled the incidents went over the old theories and discussed it anew from the different perspective time had brought there were no other customers in the cafe madame s fine ear had caught the line of their talk and she came over to their table for had it not been her lost money her vanished twenty thousand dollars that had set the whole matter going the three took up the long abandoned mystery threshing over the old dry chaff of it it was in the chapel of this house of the little sisters of samaria that robbins and dumars

madame tibault s last words robbins started slightly and cast a keen sidelong glance at dumars the creole sat unmoved dreamily watching the spirals of his cigarette smoke it was then nine o clock in the morning and a few minutes later the two friends separated going different ways to their day s duties and now follows the brief story of madame tibault s vanished thousands new orleans will readily recall to mind the circumstances attendant upon the death of mr gaspard morin in that city mr morin was an artistic goldsmith and jeweller in the old french quarter and a man held in the highest esteem he belonged to one of the oldest french families and was of some distinction as an antiquary and historian he was a bachelor about fifty years of age he lived in quiet comfort at one of those rare old hostelries in royal street he was found in his rooms one morning dead from unknown causes when his affairs came to be looked into it was found that he was practically insolvent his stock of goods and personal property barely but nearly enough to free him from censure covering his liabilities following came the disclosure that he had been entrusted with the sum of twenty thousand dollars by a former upper servant in the morin family one madame tibault which she had received as a legacy from relatives in france the most searching scrutiny by friends and the legal authorities failed to reveal the disposition of the money it had vanished and left no trace some weeks

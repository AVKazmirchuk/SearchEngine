his shoes off in your office or on the street his right foot swells a little and he likes to be comfortable if you can spare the time count his handkerchiefs when they come back from the wash i bought him a dozen new ones before he left he should be there about the time this letter reaches you i told him to go straight to your office when he arrives as soon as blandford had finished the reading of this something happened as there should happen in stories and must happen on the stage percival the office boy with his air of despising the world s output of mill supplies and leather belting came in to announce that a colored gentleman was outside to see mr blandford carteret bring him in said blandford rising john carteret swung around in his chair and said to percival ask him to wait a few minutes outside we ll let you know when to bring him in then he turned to his cousin with one of those broad slow smiles that was an inheritance of all the carterets and said bland i ve always had a consuming curiosity to understand the differences that you haughty southerners believe to exist between you all and the people of the north of course i know that you consider yourselves made out of finer clay and look upon adam as only a collateral branch of your ancestry but i don t know why i never could understand the differences between us well john said blandford laughing what you don t understand about it is just the difference of course i suppose it was the feudal way in which we lived that gave us our lordly baronial airs and feeling of superiority but you are not feudal now went on john since we licked you and stole your cotton and mules you ve had to go to work just as we damyankees as you call us have always been doing and you re just as proud and exclusive and upper classy as you were before the war so it wasn t your money that caused it maybe it was the climate said blandford lightly or maybe our negroes spoiled us i ll call old jake in now i ll be glad to see the old villain again wait just a moment said john i ve got a little theory i want to test you and i are pretty much alike in our general appearance old jake hasn t seen you since you were fifteen let s have him in and play fair and see which of us gets the watch the old darky surrey ought to be able to pick out his young marster without any trouble the alleged aristocratic superiority of a reb ought to be visible to him at once he couldn t make the mistake of handing over the timepiece to a yankee of course the loser buys the dinner this evening and two dozen collars for jake is it a go blandford agreed heartily percival was summoned and told to usher the colored gentleman in uncle jake stepped inside the private office cautiously he was a little old man as black as soot wrinkled and bald except for a fringe of white wool cut decorously short that ran over his ears and around his head there was nothing of the stage uncle about him his black suit nearly fitted him his shoes shone and his straw hat was banded with a gaudy ribbon in his right hand he carried something carefully concealed by his closed fingers uncle jake stopped a few steps from the door two young men sat in their revolving desk chairs ten feet apart and looked at him in friendly silence his gaze slowly shifted many times from one to the other he felt sure that he was in the presence of one at least of the revered family among whose fortunes his life had begun and was to end one had the pleasing but haughty carteret air the other had the unmistakable straight long family nose both had the keen black eyes horizontal brows and thin smiling lips that had distinguished both the carteret of the mayflower and him of the brigantine old jake had thought that he could have picked out his young master instantly from a thousand northerners but he found himself in difficulties the best he could do was to use strategy howdy marse blandford howdy suh he said looking midway between the two young men howdy uncle jake they both answered pleasantly and in unison sit down have you brought the watch uncle jake chose a hard bottom chair at a respectful distance sat on the edge of it and laid his hat carefully on the floor the watch in its buckskin case he gripped tightly he had not risked his life on the battle field to rescue that watch from his old marster s foes to hand it over again to the enemy without a struggle yes suh i got it in my hand suh i m gwine give it to you right away in jus a minute old missus told me to put it in young marse blandford s hand and tell him to wear it for the family pride and honor it was a mighty longsome trip for an old nigger man to make ten thousand miles it must be back to old vi ginia suh you ve growed mightily young marster i wouldn t have reconnized you but for yo powerful resemblance to old marster with admirable diplomacy the old man kept his eyes roaming in the space between the two men his words might have been addressed to either though neither wicked nor perverse he was seeking for a sign blandford and john exchanged winks i reckon you done got you ma s letter went on uncle jake she said she was gwine to write to you bout my comin along

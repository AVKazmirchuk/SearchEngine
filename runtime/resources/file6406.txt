beast had long ago twisted and mutilated his left ear being a hunter i was concerned in the evils that may befall one in the pursuit of game that ear says hicks is the relic of true friendship an accident i persisted no friendship is an accident said telemachus and i was silent the only perfect case of true friendship i ever knew went on my host was a cordial intent between a connecticut man and a monkey the monkey climbed palms in barranquilla and threw down cocoanuts to the man the man sawed them in two and made dippers which he sold for two reales each and bought rum the monkey drank the milk of the nuts through each being satisfied with his own share of the graft they lived like brothers but in the case of human beings friendship is a transitory art subject to discontinuance without further notice i had a friend once of the entitlement of paisley fish that i imagined was sealed to me for an endless space of time side by side for seven years we had mined ranched sold patent churns herded sheep took photographs and other things built wire fences and picked prunes thinks i neither homocide nor flattery nor riches nor sophistry nor drink can make trouble between me and paisley fish we was friends an amount you could hardly guess at we was friends in business and we let our amicable qualities lap over and season our hours of recreation and folly we certainly had days of damon and nights of pythias one summer me and paisley gallops down into these san andres mountains for the purpose of a month s surcease and levity dressed in the natural store habiliments of man we hit this town of los pinos which certainly was a roof garden spot of the world and flowing with condensed milk and honey it had a street or two and air and hens and a eating house and that was enough for us we strikes the town after supper time and we concludes to sample whatever efficacy there is in this eating house down by the railroad tracks by the time we had set down and pried up our plates with a knife from the red oil cloth along intrudes widow jessup with the hot biscuit and the fried liver now there was a woman that would have tempted an anchovy to forget his vows she was not so small as she was large and a kind of welcome air seemed to mitigate her vicinity the pink of her face was the in hoc signo of a culinary temper and a warm disposition and her smile would have brought out the dogwood blossoms in december widow jessup talks to us a lot of garrulousness about the climate and history and tennyson and prunes and the scarcity of mutton and finally wants to know where we came from spring valley says i big spring valley chips in paisley out of a lot of potatoes and knuckle bone of ham in his mouth that was the first sign i noticed that the old fidus diogenes business between me and paisley fish was ended forever he knew how i hated a talkative person and yet he stampedes into the conversation with his amendments and addendums of syntax on the map it was big spring valley but i had heard paisley himself call it spring valley a thousand times without saying any more we went out after supper and set on the railroad track we had been pardners too long not to know what was going on in each other s mind i reckon you understand says paisley that i ve made up my mind to accrue that widow woman as part and parcel in and to my hereditaments forever both domestic sociable legal and otherwise until death us do part why yes says i i read it between the lines though you only spoke one and i suppose you are aware says i that i have a movement on foot that leads up to the widow s changing her name to hicks and leaves you writing to the society column to inquire whether the best man wears a japonica or seamless socks at the wedding there ll be some hiatuses in your program says paisley chewing up a piece of a railroad tie i d give in to you says he in most any respect if it was secular affairs but this is not so the smiles of woman goes on paisley is the whirlpool of squills and chalybeates into which vortex the good ship friendship is often drawn and dismembered i d assault a bear that was annoying you says paisley or i d endorse your note or rub the place between your shoulder blades with opodeldoc the same as ever but there my sense of etiquette ceases in this fracas with mrs jessup we play it alone i ve notified you fair and then i collaborates with myself and offers the following resolutions and by laws friendship between man and man says i is an ancient historical virtue enacted in the days when men had to protect each other against lizards with eighty foot tails and flying turtles and they ve kept up the habit to this day and stand by each other till the bellboy comes up and tells them the animals are not really there i ve often heard i says about ladies stepping in and breaking up a friendship between men why should that be i ll tell you paisley the first sight and hot biscuit of mrs jessup appears to have inserted a oscillation into each of our bosoms let the best man of us have her i ll play you a square game and won t do any underhanded work i ll do all of my courting of her in your presence so you will have an equal opportunity with that arrangement i don t see why our steamboat of friendship should fall overboard in the medicinal whirlpools you speak of whichever of us wins out good old hoss says paisley shaking my hand and i ll do the same says he we ll court the lady synonymously and without any of the prudery and bloodshed usual to such occasions and we ll be friends still win or lose at one side of mrs jessup s eating house was a bench under some trees where she used to sit in the breeze after the south bound had been fed and gone and there me and paisley used to congregate after supper and make partial payments on our respects to the lady of our choice and we was so honorable and circuitous in our calls that if one of us got there first we waited for the other before beginning any gallivantery the first evening that mrs jessup knew about our arrangement i got to the bench before paisley did supper was just over and mrs jessup was out there with a fresh pink dress on and almost cool enough to handle i sat down by her and made a few specifications about the moral surface of nature as set forth by the landscape and the contiguous perspective that evening was surely a case in point the moon was attending to business in the section of sky where it belonged and the trees was making shadows on the ground according to science and nature and there was a kind of conspicuous hullabaloo going on in the bushes between the bullbats and the orioles and the jack rabbits and other feathered insects of the forest and the wind out of the mountains was singing like a jew s harp in the pile of old tomato cans by the railroad track i felt a kind of sensation in my left side something like dough rising in a crock by the fire mrs jessup had moved up closer oh mr hicks says she when one is alone in the world don t they feel it more aggravated on a beautiful night like this i rose up off the bench at once excuse me ma am says i but i ll have to wait till paisley comes before i can give a audible hearing to leading questions like that and then i explained to her how we was friends cinctured by years of embarrassment and travel and complicity and how we had agreed to take no advantage of each other in any of the more mushy walks of life such as might be fomented by sentiment and proximity mrs jessup appears to think serious about the matter for a minute and then she breaks into a species of laughter that makes the wildwood resound in a few minutes paisley drops around with oil of bergamot on his hair and sits on the other side of mrs jessup and inaugurates a sad tale of adventure in which him and pieface lumley has a skinning match of dead cows in for a silver mounted saddle in the santa rita valley during the nine months drought now from the start of that courtship i had paisley fish hobbled and tied to a post each one of us had a different system of reaching out for the easy places in the female heart paisley s scheme was to petrify em with wonderful relations of events that he had either come across personally or in large print i think he must have got his idea of subjugation from one of shakespeare s shows i see once called othello there is a coloured man in it who acquires a duke s daughter by disbursing to her a mixture of the talk turned out by rider haggard lew dockstader and dr parkhurst but that style of courting don t work well off the stage now i give you my own recipe for inveigling a woman into that state of affairs when she can be referred to as n e jones learn how to pick up her hand and hold it and she s yours it ain t so easy some men grab at it so much like they was going to set a dislocation of the shoulder that you can smell the arnica and hear em tearing off bandages some take it up like a hot horseshoe and hold it off at arm s length like a druggist pouring tincture of asafoetida in a bottle and most of em catch hold of it and drag it right out before the lady s eyes like a boy finding a baseball in the grass without giving her a chance to forget that the hand is growing on the end of her arm them ways are all wrong i ll tell you the right way did you ever see a man sneak out in the back yard and pick up a rock to throw at a tomcat that was sitting on a fence looking at him he pretends he hasn t got a thing in his hand and that the cat don t see him and that he don t see the cat that s the idea never drag her hand out where she ll have to take notice of it don t let her know that you think she knows you have the least idea she is aware you are holding her hand that was my rule of tactics and as far as paisley s serenade about hostilities and misadventure went he might as well have been reading to her a time table of the sunday trains that stop at ocean grove new jersey one night when i beat paisley to the bench by one pipeful my friendship gets subsidised for a minute and i asks mrs jessup if she didn t think a h was easier to write than a j in a second her head was mashing the oleander flower in my button hole and i leaned over and but i didn t if you don t mind says i standing up we ll wait for paisley to come before finishing this i ve never done anything dishonourable yet to our friendship and this won t be quite fair mr hicks says mrs jessup looking at me peculiar in the dark if it wasn t for but one thing i d ask you to hike yourself down the gulch and never disresume your visits to my house and what is that ma am i asks you are too good a friend not to make a good husband says she in five minutes paisley was on his side of mrs jessup in silver city in the summer of he begins i see jim batholomew chew off a chinaman s ear in the blue light saloon on account of a crossbarred muslin shirt that what was that noise i had resumed matters again with mrs jessup right where we had left off mrs jessup says i has promised to make it hicks and this is another of the same sort paisley winds his feet round a leg of the bench and kind of groans lem says he we been friends for seven years would you mind not kissing mrs jessup quite so loud i d do the same for you all right says i the other kind will do as well this chinaman goes on paisley was the one that shot a man named mullins in the spring of and that was paisley interrupted himself again lem says he if you was a true friend you wouldn t hug mrs jessup quite so hard i felt the bench shake all over just then you know you told me you would give me an even chance as long as there was any mr man says mrs jessup turning around to paisley if you was to drop in to the celebration of mine and mr hicks s silver wedding twenty five years from now do you think you could get it into that hubbard squash you call your head that you are nix cum rous in this business i ve put up with you a long time because you was mr hicks s friend but it seems to me it s time for you to wear the willow and trot off down the hill mrs jessup says i without losing my grasp on the situation as fiance mr paisley is my friend and i offered him a square deal and a equal opportunity as long as there was a chance a chance says she well he may think he has a chance but i hope he won t think he s got a cinch after what he s been next to all the evening well a month afterwards me and mrs jessup was married in the los pinos methodist church and the whole town closed up to see the performance when we lined up in front and the preacher was beginning to sing out his rituals and observances i looks around and misses paisley i calls time on the preacher paisley ain t here says i we ve got to wait for paisley a friend once a friend always that s telemachus hicks says i mrs jessup s eyes snapped some but the preacher holds up the incantations according to instructions in a few minutes paisley gallops up the aisle putting on a cuff as he comes he explains that the only dry goods store in town was closed for the wedding and he couldn t get the kind of a boiled shirt that his taste called for until he had broke open the back window of the store and helped himself then he ranges up on the other side of the bride and the wedding goes on i always imagined that paisley calculated as a last chance that the preacher might marry him to the widow by mistake after the proceedings was over we had tea and jerked antelope and canned apricots and then the populace hiked itself away last of all paisley shook me by the hand and told me i d acted square and on the level with him and he was proud to call me a friend the preacher had a small house on the side of the street that he d fixed up to rent and he allowed me and mrs hicks to occupy it till the ten forty train the next morning when we was going on a bridal tour to el paso his wife had decorated it all up with hollyhocks and poison ivy and it looked real festal and bowery about ten o clock that night i sets down in the front door and pulls off my boots a while in the cool breeze while mrs hicks was fixing around in the room right soon the light went out inside and i sat there a while reverberating over old times and scenes and then i heard mrs hicks call out ain t you coming in soon lem well well says i kind of rousing up durn me if i wasn t waiting for old paisley to but when i got that far concluded telemachus hicks i thought somebody had shot this left ear of mine off with a forty five but it turned out to be only a lick from a broomhandle in the hands of mrs hicks the handbook of hymen tis the opinion of myself sanderson pratt who sets this down that the educational system of the united states should be in the hands of the weather bureau i can give you good reasons for it and you can t tell me why our college professors shouldn t be transferred to the meteorological department they have been learned to read and they could very easily glance at the morning papers and then wire in to the main office what kind of weather to expect but there s the other side of the proposition i am going on to tell you how the weather furnished me and idaho green with an elegant education we was up in the bitter root mountains over the montana line prospecting for gold a chin whiskered man in walla walla carrying a line of hope as excess baggage had grubstaked us and there we was in the foothills pecking away with enough grub on hand to last an army through a peace conference along one day comes a mail rider over the mountains from carlos and stops to eat three cans of greengages and leave us a newspaper of modern date this paper prints a system of premonitions of the weather and the card it dealt bitter root mountains from the bottom of the deck was warmer and fair with light westerly breezes that evening it began to snow with the wind strong in the east me and idaho moved camp into an old empty cabin higher up the mountain thinking it was only a november flurry but after falling three foot on a level it went to work in earnest and we knew we was snowed in we got in plenty of firewood before it got deep and we had grub enough for two months so we let the elements rage and cut up all they thought proper if you want to instigate the art of manslaughter just shut two men up in a eighteen by twenty foot cabin for a month human nature won t stand it when the first snowflakes fell me and idaho green laughed at each other s jokes and praised the stuff we turned out of a skillet and called bread at the end of three weeks idaho makes this kind of a edict to me says he i never exactly heard sour milk dropping out of a balloon on the bottom of a tin pan but i have an idea it would be music of the spears compared to this attenuated stream of asphyxiated thought that emanates out of your organs of conversation the kind of half masticated noises that you emit every day puts me in mind of a cow s cud only she s lady enough to keep hers to herself and you ain t mr green says i you having been a friend of mine once i have some hesitations in confessing to you that if i had my choice for society between you and a common yellow three legged cur pup one of the inmates of this here cabin would be wagging a tail just at present this way we goes on for two or three days and then we quits speaking to one another we divides up the cooking implements and idaho cooks his grub on one side of the fireplace and me on the other the snow is up to the windows and we have to keep a fire all day you see me and idaho never had any education beyond reading and doing if john had three apples and james five on a slate we never felt any special need for a university degree though we had acquired a species of intrinsic intelligence in knocking around the world that we could use in emergencies but snowbound in that cabin in the bitter roots we felt for the first time that if we had studied homer or greek and fractions and the higher branches of information we d have had some resources in the line of meditation and private thought i ve seen them eastern college fellows working in camps all through the west and i never noticed but what education was less of a drawback to em than you would think why once over on snake river when andrew mcwilliams saddle horse got the botts he sent a buckboard ten miles for one of these strangers that claimed to be a botanist but that horse died one morning idaho was poking around with a stick on top of a little shelf that was too high to reach two books fell down to the floor i started toward em but caught idaho s eye he speaks for the first time in a week don t burn your fingers says he in spite of the fact that you re only fit to be the companion of a sleeping mud turtle i ll give you a square deal and that s more than your parents did when they turned you loose in the world with the sociability of a rattle snake and the bedside manner of a frozen turnip i ll play you a game of seven up the winner to pick up his choice of the book the loser to take the other we played and idaho won he picked up his book and i took mine then each of us got on his side of the house and went to reading i never was as glad to see a ten ounce nugget as i was that book and idaho took at his like a kid looks at a stick of candy mine was a little book about five by six inches called herkimer s handbook of indispensable information i may be wrong but i think that was the greatest book that ever was written i ve got it to day and i can stump you or any man fifty times in five minutes with the information in it talk about solomon or the new york tribune herkimer had cases on both of em that man must have put in fifty years and travelled a million miles to find out all that stuff there was the population of all cities in it and the way to tell a girl s age and the number of teeth a camel has it told you the longest tunnel in the world the number of the stars how long it takes for chicken pox to break out what a lady s neck ought to measure the veto powers of governors the dates of the roman aqueducts how many pounds of rice going without three beers a day would buy the average annual temperature of augusta maine the quantity of seed required to plant an acre of carrots in drills antidotes for poisons the number of hairs on a blond lady s head how to preserve eggs the height of all the mountains in the world and the dates of all wars and battles and how to restore drowned persons and sunstroke and the number of tacks in a pound and how to make dynamite and flowers and beds and what to do before the doctor comes and a hundred times as many things besides if there was anything herkimer didn t know i didn t miss it out of the book i sat and read that book for four hours all the wonders of education was compressed in it i forgot the snow and i forgot that me and old idaho was on the outs he was sitting still on a stool reading away with a kind of partly soft and partly mysterious look shining through his tan bark whiskers idaho says i what kind of a book is yours idaho must have forgot too for he answered moderate without any slander or malignity why says he this here seems to be a volume by homer k m homer k m what i asks why just homer k m says he you re a liar says i a little riled that idaho should try to put me up a tree no man is going round signing books with his initials if it s homer k m spoopendyke or homer k m mcsweeney or homer k m jones why don t you say so like a man instead of biting off the end of it like a calf chewing off the tail of a shirt on a clothes line i put it to you straight sandy says idaho quiet it s a poem book says he by homer k m i couldn t get colour out of it at first but there s a vein if you follow it up i wouldn t have missed this book for a pair of red blankets you re welcome to it says i what i want is a disinterested statement of facts for the mind to work on and that s what i seem to find in the book i ve drawn what you ve got says idaho is statistics the lowest grade of information that exists they ll poison your mind give me old k m s system of surmises he seems to be a kind of a wine agent his regular toast is nothing doing and he seems to have a grouch but he keeps it so well lubricated with booze that his worst kicks sound like an invitation to split a quart but it s poetry says idaho and i have sensations of scorn for that truck of yours that tries to convey sense in feet and inches when it comes to explaining the instinct of philosophy through the art of nature old k m has got your man beat by drills rows paragraphs chest measurement and average annual rainfall so that s the way me and idaho had it day and night all the excitement we got was studying our books that snowstorm sure fixed us with a fine lot of attainments apiece by the time the snow melted if you had stepped up to me suddenly and said sanderson pratt what would it cost per square foot to lay a roof with twenty by twenty eight tin at nine dollars and fifty cents per box i d have told you as quick as light could travel the length of a spade handle at the rate of one hundred and ninety two thousand miles per second how many can do it you wake up most any man you know in the middle of the night and ask him quick to tell you the number of bones in the human skeleton exclusive of the teeth or what percentage of the vote of the nebraska legislature overrules a veto will he tell you try him and see about what benefit idaho got out of his poetry book i didn t exactly know idaho boosted the wine agent every time he opened his mouth but i wasn t so sure this homer k m from what leaked out of his libretto through idaho seemed to me to be a kind of a dog who looked at life like it was a tin can tied to his tail after running himself half to death he sits down hangs his tongue out and looks at the can and says oh well since we can t shake the growler let s get it filled at the corner and all have a drink on me besides that it seems he was a persian and i never hear of persia producing anything worth mentioning unless it was turkish rugs and maltese cats that spring me and idaho struck pay ore it was a habit of ours to sell out quick and keep moving we unloaded our grubstaker for eight thousand dollars apiece and then we drifted down to this little town of rosa on the salmon river to rest up and get some human grub and have our whiskers harvested rosa was no mining camp it laid in the valley and was as free of uproar and pestilence as one of them rural towns in the country there was a three mile trolley line champing its bit in the environs and me and idaho spent a week riding on one of the cars dropping off at nights at the sunset view hotel being now well read as well as travelled we was soon pro re nata with the best society in rosa and was invited out to the most dressed up and high toned entertainments it was at a piano recital and quail eating contest in the city hall for the benefit of the fire company that me and idaho first met mrs de ormond sampson the queen of rosa society mrs sampson was a widow and owned the only two story house in town it was painted yellow and whichever way you looked from you could see it as plain as egg on the chin of an o grady on a friday twenty two men in rosa besides me and idaho was trying to stake a claim on that yellow house there was a dance after the song books and quail bones had been raked out of the hall twenty three of the bunch galloped over to mrs sampson and asked for a dance i side stepped the two step and asked permission to escort her home that s where i made a hit on the way home says she ain t the stars lovely and bright to night mr pratt for the chance they ve got says i they re humping themselves in a mighty creditable way that big one you see is sixty six million miles distant it took thirty six years for its light to reach us with an eighteen foot telescope you can see forty three millions of em including them of the thirteenth magnitude which if one was to go out now you would keep on seeing it for twenty seven hundred years my says mrs sampson i never knew that before how warm it is i m as damp as i can be from dancing so much that s easy to account for says i when you happen to know that you ve got two million sweat glands working all at once if every one of your perspiratory ducts which are a quarter of an inch long was placed end to end they would reach a distance of seven miles lawsy says mrs sampson it sounds like an irrigation ditch you was describing mr pratt how do you get all this knowledge of information from observation mrs sampson i tells her i keep my eyes open when i go about the world mr pratt says she i always did admire a man of education there are so few scholars among the sap headed plug uglies of this town that it is a real pleasure to converse with a gentleman of culture i d be gratified to have you call at my house whenever you feel so inclined and that was the way i got the goodwill of the lady in the yellow house every tuesday and friday evening i used to go there and tell her about the wonders of the universe as discovered tabulated and compiled from nature by herkimer idaho and the other gay lutherans of the town got every minute of the rest of the week that they could i never imagined that idaho was trying to work on mrs sampson with old k m s rules of courtship till one afternoon when i was on my way over to take her a basket of wild hog plums i met the lady coming down the lane that led to her house her eyes was snapping and her hat made a dangerous dip over one eye mr pratt she opens up this mr green is a friend of yours i believe for nine years says i cut him out says she he s no gentleman why ma am says i he s a plain incumbent of the mountains with asperities and the usual failings of a spendthrift and a liar but i never on the most momentous occasion had the heart to deny that he was a gentleman it may be that in haberdashery and the sense of arrogance and display idaho offends the eye but inside ma am i ve found him impervious to the lower grades of crime and obesity after nine years of idaho s society mrs sampson i winds up i should hate to impute him and i should hate to see him imputed it s right plausible of you mr pratt says mrs sampson to take up the curmudgeons in your friend s behalf but it don t alter the fact that he has made proposals to me sufficiently obnoxious to ruffle the ignominy of any lady why now now now says i old idaho do that i could believe it of myself sooner i never knew but one thing to deride in him and a blizzard was responsible for that once while we was snow bound in the mountains he became a prey to a kind of spurious and uneven poetry which may have corrupted his demeanour it has says mrs sampson ever since i knew him he has been reciting to me a lot of irreligious rhymes by some person he calls ruby ott and who is no better than she should be if you judge by her poetry then idaho has struck a new book says i for the one he had was by a man who writes under the nom de plume of k m he d better have stuck to it says mrs sampson whatever it was and to day he caps the vortex i get a bunch of flowers from him and on em is pinned a note now mr pratt you know a lady when you see her and you know how i stand in rosa society do you think for a moment that i d skip out to the woods with a man along with a jug of wine and a loaf of bread and go singing and cavorting up and down under the trees with him i take a little claret with my meals but i m not in the habit of packing a jug of it into the brush and raising cain in any such style as that and of course he d bring his book of verses along too he said so let him go on his scandalous picnics alone or let him take his ruby ott with him i reckon she wouldn t kick unless it was on account of there being too much bread along and what do you think of your gentleman friend now mr pratt well m says i it may be that idaho s invitation was a kind of poetry and meant no harm may be it belonged to the class of rhymes they call figurative they offend law and order but they get sent through the mails on the grounds that they mean something that they don t say i d be glad on idaho s account if you d overlook it says i and let us extricate our minds from the low regions of poetry to the higher planes of fact and fancy on a beautiful afternoon like this mrs sampson i goes on we should let our thoughts dwell accordingly though it is warm here we should remember that at the equator the line of perpetual frost is at an altitude of fifteen thousand feet between the latitudes of forty degrees and forty nine degrees it is from four thousand to nine thousand feet oh mr pratt says mrs sampson it s such a comfort to hear you say them beautiful facts after getting such a jar from that minx of a ruby s poetry let us sit on this log at the roadside says i and forget the inhumanity and ribaldry of the poets it is in the glorious columns of ascertained facts and legalised measures that beauty is to be found in this very log we sit upon mrs sampson says i is statistics more wonderful than any poem the rings show it was sixty years old at the depth of two thousand feet it would become coal in three thousand years the deepest coal mine in the world is at killingworth near newcastle a box four feet long three feet wide and two feet eight inches deep will hold one ton of coal if an artery is cut compress it above the wound a man s leg contains thirty bones the tower of london was burned in go on mr pratt says mrs sampson them ideas is so original and soothing i think statistics are just as lovely as they can be but it wasn t till two weeks later that i got all that was coming to me out of herkimer one night i was waked up by folks hollering fire all around i jumped up and dressed and went out of the hotel to enjoy the scene when i see it was mrs sampson s house i gave forth a kind of yell and i was there in two minutes the whole lower story of the yellow house was in flames and every masculine feminine and canine in rosa was there screeching and barking and getting in the way of the firemen i saw idaho trying to get away from six firemen who were holding him they was telling him the whole place was on fire down stairs and no man could go in it and come out alive where s mrs sampson i asks she hasn t been seen says one of the firemen she sleeps up stairs we ve tried to get in but we can t and our company hasn t got any ladders yet i runs around to the light of the big blaze and pulls the handbook out of my inside pocket i kind of laughed when i felt it in my hands i reckon i was some daffy with the sensation of excitement herky old boy i says to it as i flipped over the pages you ain t ever lied to me yet and you ain t ever throwed me down at a scratch yet tell me what old boy tell me what says i i turned to what to do in case of accidents on page i run my finger down the page and struck it good old herkimer he never overlooked anything it said suffocation from inhaling smoke or gas there is nothing better than flaxseed place a few seed in the outer corner of the eye i shoved the handbook back in my pocket and grabbed a boy that was running by here says i giving him some money run to the drug store and bring a dollar s worth of flaxseed hurry and you ll get another one for yourself now i sings out to the crowd we ll have mrs sampson and i throws away my coat and hat four of the firemen and citizens grabs hold of me it s sure death they say to go in the house for the floors was beginning to fall through how in blazes i sings out kind of laughing yet but not feeling like it do you expect me to put flaxseed in a eye without the eye i jabbed each elbow in a fireman s face kicked the bark off of one citizen s shin and tripped the other one with a side hold and then i busted into the house if i die first i ll write you a letter and tell you if it s any worse down there than the inside of that yellow house was but don t believe it yet i was a heap more cooked than the hurry up orders of broiled chicken that you get in restaurants the fire and smoke had me down on the floor twice and was about to shame herkimer but the firemen helped me with their little stream of water and i got to mrs sampson s room she d lost conscientiousness from the smoke so i wrapped her in the bed clothes and got her on my shoulder well the floors wasn t as bad as they said or i never could have done it not by no means i carried her out fifty yards from the house and laid her on the grass then of course every one of them other twenty two plaintiff s to the lady s hand crowded around with tin dippers of water ready to save her and up runs the boy with the flaxseed i unwrapped the covers from mrs sampson s head she opened her eyes and says is that you mr pratt s s sh says i don t talk till you ve had the remedy i runs my arm around her neck and raises her head gentle and breaks the bag of flaxseed with the other hand and as easy as i could i bends over and slips three or four of the seeds in the outer corner of her eye up gallops the village doc by this time and snorts around and grabs at mrs sampson s pulse and wants to know what i mean by any such sandblasted nonsense well old jalap and jerusalem oakseed says i i m no regular practitioner but i ll show you my authority anyway they fetched my coat and i gets out the handbook look on page says i at the remedy for suffocation by smoke or gas flaxseed in the outer corner of the eye it says i don t know whether it works as a smoke consumer or whether it hikes the compound gastro hippopotamus nerve into action but herkimer says it and he was called to the case first if you want to make it a consultation there s no objection old doc takes the book and looks at it by means of his specs and a fireman s lantern well mr pratt says he you evidently got on the wrong line in reading your diagnosis the recipe for suffocation says get the patient into fresh air as quickly as possible and place in a reclining position the flaxseed remedy is for dust and cinders in the eye on the line above but after all see here interrupts mrs sampson i reckon i ve got something to say in this consultation that flaxseed done me more good than anything i ever tried and then she raises up her head and lays it back on my arm again and says put some in the other eye sandy dear and so if you was to stop off at rosa to morrow or any other day you d see a fine new yellow house with mrs pratt that was mrs sampson embellishing and adorning it and if you was to step inside you d see on the marble top centre table in the parlour herkimer s handbook of indispensable information all rebound in red morocco and ready to be consulted on any subject pertaining to human happiness and wisdom the pimienta pancakes while we were rounding up a bunch of the triangle o cattle in the frio bottoms a projecting branch of a dead mesquite caught my wooden stirrup and gave my ankle a wrench that laid me up in camp for a week on the third day of my compulsory idleness i crawled out near the grub wagon and reclined helpless under the conversational fire of judson odom the camp cook jud was a monologist by nature whom destiny with customary blundering had set in a profession wherein he was bereaved for the greater portion of his time of an audience therefore i was manna in the desert of jud s obmutescence betimes i was stirred by invalid longings for something to eat that did not come under the caption of grub i had visions of the maternal pantry deep as first love and wild with all regret and then i asked jud can you make pancakes jud laid down his six shooter with which he was preparing to pound an antelope steak and stood over me in what i felt to be a menacing attitude he further endorsed my impression that his pose was resentful by fixing upon me with his light blue eyes a look of cold suspicion say you he said with candid though not excessive choler did you mean that straight or was you trying to throw the gaff into me some of the boys been telling you about me and that pancake racket no jud i said sincerely i meant it it seems to me i d swap my pony and saddle for a stack of buttered brown pancakes with some first crop open kettle new orleans sweetening was there a story about pancakes jud was mollified at once when he saw that i had not been dealing in allusions he brought some mysterious bags and tin boxes from the grub wagon and set them in the shade of the hackberry where i lay reclined i watched him as he began to arrange them leisurely and untie their many strings no not a story said jud as he worked but just the logical disclosures in the case of me and that pink eyed snoozer from mired mule canada and miss willella learight i don t mind telling you i was punching then for old bill toomey on the san miguel one day i gets all ensnared up in aspirations for to eat some canned grub that hasn t ever mooed or baaed or grunted or been in peck measures so i gets on my bronc and pushes the wind for uncle emsley telfair s store at the pimienta crossing on the nueces about three in the afternoon i throwed my bridle rein over a mesquite limb and walked the last twenty yards into uncle emsley s store i got up on the counter and told uncle emsley that the signs pointed to the devastation of the fruit crop of the world in a minute i had a bag of crackers and a long handled spoon with an open can each of apricots and pineapples and cherries and greengages beside of me with uncle emsley busy chopping away with the hatchet at the yellow clings i was feeling like adam before the apple stampede and was digging my spurs into the side of the counter and working with my twenty four inch spoon when i happened to look out of the window into the yard of uncle emsley s house which was next to the store there was a girl standing there an imported girl with fixings on philandering with a croquet maul and amusing herself by watching my style of encouraging the fruit canning industry i slid off the counter and delivered up my shovel to uncle emsley that s my niece says he miss willella learight down from palestine on a visit do you want that i should make you acquainted the holy land i says to myself my thoughts milling some as i tried to run em into the corral why not there was sure angels in pales why yes uncle emsley i says out loud i d be awful edified to meet miss learight so uncle emsley took me out in the yard and gave us each other s entitlements i never was shy about women i never could understand why some men who can break a mustang before breakfast and shave in the dark get all left handed and full of perspiration and excuses when they see a bold of calico draped around what belongs to it inside of eight minutes me and miss willella was aggravating the croquet balls around as amiable as second cousins she gave me a dig about the quantity of canned fruit i had eaten and i got back at her flat footed about how a certain lady named eve started the fruit trouble in the first free grass pasture over in palestine wasn t it says i as easy and pat as roping a one year old that was how i acquired cordiality for the proximities of miss willella learight and the disposition grew larger as time passed she was stopping at pimienta crossing for her health which was very good and for the climate which was forty per cent hotter than palestine i rode over to see her once every week for a while and then i figured it out that if i doubled the number of trips i would see her twice as often one week i slipped in a third trip and that s where the pancakes and the pink eyed snoozer busted into the game that evening while i set on the counter with a peach and two damsons in my mouth i asked uncle emsley how miss willella was why says uncle emsley she s gone riding with jackson bird the sheep man from over at mired mule canada i swallowed the peach seed and the two damson seeds i guess somebody held the counter by the bridle while i got off and then i walked out straight ahead till i butted against the mesquite where my roan was tied she s gone riding i whisper in my bronc s ear with birdstone jack the hired mule from sheep man s canada did you get that old leather and gallops that bronc of mine wept in his way he d been raised a cow pony and he didn t care for snoozers i went back and said to uncle emsley did you say a sheep man i said a sheep man says uncle emsley again you must have heard tell of jackson bird he s got eight sections of grazing and four thousand head of the finest merinos south of the arctic circle i went out and sat on the ground in the shade of the store and leaned against a prickly pear i sifted sand into my boots with unthinking hands while i soliloquised a quantity about this bird with the jackson plumage to his name i never had believed in harming sheep men i see one one day reading a latin grammar on hossback and i never touched him they never irritated me like they do most cowmen you wouldn t go to work now and impair and disfigure snoozers would you that eat on tables and wear little shoes and speak to you on subjects i had always let em pass just as you would a jack rabbit with a polite word and a guess about the weather but no stopping to swap canteens i never thought it was worth while to be hostile with a snoozer and because i d been lenient and let em live here was one going around riding with miss willella learight an hour by sun they come loping back and stopped at uncle emsley s gate the sheep person helped her off and they stood throwing each other sentences all sprightful and sagacious for a while and then this feathered jackson flies up in his saddle and raises his little stewpot of a hat and trots off in the direction of his mutton ranch by this time i had turned the sand out of my boots and unpinned myself from the prickly pear and by the time he gets half a mile out of pimienta i singlefoots up beside him on my bronc i said that snoozer was pink eyed but he wasn t his seeing arrangement was grey enough but his eye lashes was pink and his hair was sandy and that gave you the idea sheep man he wasn t more than a lamb man anyhow a little thing with his neck involved in a yellow silk handkerchief and shoes tied up in bowknots afternoon says i to him you now ride with a equestrian who is commonly called dead moral certainty judson on account of the way i shoot when i want a stranger to know me i always introduce myself before the draw for i never did like to shake hands with ghosts ah says he just like that ah i m glad to know you mr judson i m jackson bird from over at mired mule ranch just then one of my eyes saw a roadrunner skipping down the hill with a young tarantula in his bill and the other eye noticed a rabbit hawk sitting on a dead limb in a water elm i popped over one after the other with my forty five just to show him two out of three says i birds just naturally seem to draw my fire wherever i go nice shooting says the sheep man without a flutter but don t you sometimes ever miss the third shot elegant fine rain that was last week for the young grass mr judson says he willie says i riding over close to his palfrey your infatuated parents may have denounced you by the name of jackson but you sure moulted into a twittering willie let us slough off this here analysis of rain and the elements and get down to talk that is outside the vocabulary of parrots that is a bad habit you have got of riding with young ladies over at pimienta i ve known birds says i to be served on toast for less than that miss willella says i don t ever want any nest made out of sheep s wool by a tomtit of the jacksonian branch of ornithology now are you going to quit or do you wish for to gallop up against this dead moral certainty attachment to my name which is good for two hyphens and at least one set of funeral obsequies jackson bird flushed up some and then he laughed why mr judson says he you ve got the wrong idea i ve called on miss learight a few times but not for the purpose you imagine my object is purely a gastronomical one i reached for my gun any coyote says i that would boast of dishonourable wait a minute says this bird till i explain what would i do with a wife if you ever saw that ranch of mine i do my own cooking and mending eating that s all the pleasure i get out of sheep raising mr judson did you ever taste the pancakes that miss learight makes me no i told him i never was advised that she was up to any culinary manoeuvres they re golden sunshine says he honey browned by the ambrosial fires of epicurus i d give two years of my life to get the recipe for making them pancakes that s what i went to see miss learight for says jackson bird but i haven t been able to get it from her it s an old recipe that s been in the family for seventy five years they hand it down from one generation to another but they don t give it away to outsiders if i could get that recipe so i could make them pancakes for myself on my ranch i d be a happy man says bird are you sure i says to him that it ain t the hand that mixes the pancakes that you re after sure says jackson miss learight is a mighty nice girl but i can assure you my intentions go no further than the gastro but he seen my hand going down to my holster and he changed his similitude than the desire to procure a copy of the pancake recipe he finishes you ain t such a bad little man says i trying to be fair i was thinking some of making orphans of your sheep but i ll let you fly away this time but you stick to pancakes says i as close as the middle one of a stack and don t go and mistake sentiments for syrup or there ll be singing at your ranch and you won t hear it to convince you that i am sincere says the sheep man i ll ask you to help me miss learight and you being closer friends maybe she would do for you what she wouldn t for me if you will get me a copy of that pancake recipe i give you my word that i ll never call upon her again that s fair i says and i shook hands with jackson bird i ll get it for you if i can and glad to oblige and he turned off down the big pear flat on the piedra in the direction of mired mule and i steered northwest for old bill toomey s ranch it was five days afterward when i got another chance to ride over to pimienta miss willella and me passed a gratifying evening at uncle emsley s she sang some and exasperated the piano quite a lot with quotations from the operas i gave imitations of a rattlesnake and told her about snaky mcfee s new way of skinning cows and described the trip i made to saint louis once we was getting along in one another s estimations fine thinks i if jackson bird can now be persuaded to migrate i win i recollect his promise about the pancake receipt and i thinks i will persuade it from miss willella and give it to him and then if i catches birdie off of mired mule again i ll make him hop the twig so along about ten o clock i put on a wheedling smile and says to miss willella now if there s anything i do like better than the sight of a red steer on green grass it s the taste of a nice hot pancake smothered in sugar house molasses miss willella gives a little jump on the piano stool and looked at me curious yes says she they re real nice what did you say was the name of that street in saint louis mr odom where you lost your hat pancake avenue says i with a wink to show her that i was on about the family receipt and couldn

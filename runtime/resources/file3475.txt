young clubman setting out slightly bored to inaugurate the pleasures of the evening chandler s honorarium was per week he was employed in the office of an architect he was twenty two years old he considered architecture to be truly an art and he honestly believed though he would not have dared to admit it in new york that the flatiron building was inferior to design to the great cathedral in milan out of each week s earnings chandler set aside at the end of each ten weeks with the extra capital thus accumulated he purchased one gentleman s evening from the bargain counter of stingy old father time he arrayed himself in the regalia of millionaires and presidents he took himself to the quarter where life is brightest and showiest and there dined with taste and luxury with ten dollars a man may for a few hours play the wealthy idler to perfection the sum is ample for a well considered meal a bottle bearing a respectable label commensurate tips a smoke cab fare and the ordinary etceteras this one delectable evening culled from each dull seventy was to chandler a source of renascent bliss to the society bud comes but one debut it stands alone sweet in her memory when her hair has whitened but to chandler each ten weeks brought a joy as keen as thrilling as new as the first had been to sit among bon vivants under palms in the swirl of concealed music to look upon the habitues of such a paradise and to be looked upon by them what is a girl s first dance and short sleeved tulle compared with this up broadway chandler moved with the vespertine dress parade for this evening he was an exhibit as well as a gazer for the next sixty nine evenings he would be dining in cheviot and worsted at dubious table d hotes at whirlwind lunch counters on sandwiches and beer in his hall bedroom he was willing to do that for he was a true son of the great city of razzle dazzle and to him one evening in the limelight made up for many dark ones chandler protracted his walk until the forties began to intersect the great and glittering primrose way for the evening was yet young and when one is of the beau monde only one day in seventy one loves to protract the pleasure eyes bright sinister curious admiring provocative alluring were bent upon him for his garb and air proclaimed him a devotee to the hour of solace and pleasure at a certain corner he came to a standstill proposing to himself the question of turning back toward the showy and fashionable restaurant in which he usually dined on the evenings of his especial luxury just then a girl scuddled lightly around the corner slipped on a patch of icy snow and fell plump upon the sidewalk chandler assisted her to her feet with instant and solicitous courtesy the girl hobbled to the wall of the building leaned against it and thanked him demurely i think my ankle is strained she said it twisted when i fell does it pain you much inquired chandler only when i rest my weight upon it i think i will be able to walk in a minute or two if i can be of any further service suggested the young man i will call a cab or thank you said the girl softly but heartily i am sure you need not trouble yourself any further it was so awkward of me and my shoe heels are horridly common sense i can t blame them at all chandler looked at the girl and found her swiftly drawing his interest she was pretty in a refined way and her eye was both merry and kind she was inexpensively clothed in a plain black dress that suggested a sort of uniform such as shop girls wear her glossy dark brown hair showed its coils beneath a cheap hat of black straw whose only ornament was a velvet ribbon and bow she could have posed as a model for the self respecting working girl of the best type a sudden idea came into the head of the young architect he would ask this girl to dine with him here was the element that his splendid but solitary periodic feasts had lacked his brief season of elegant luxury would be doubly enjoyable if he could add to it a lady s society this girl was a lady he was sure her manner and speech settled that and in spite of her extremely plain attire he felt that he would be pleased to sit at table with her these thoughts passed swiftly through his mind and he decided to ask her it was a breach of etiquette of course but oftentimes wage earning girls waived formalities in matters of this kind they were generally shrewd judges of men and thought better of their own judgment than they did of useless conventions his ten dollars discreetly expended would enable the two to dine very well indeed the dinner would no doubt be a wonderful experience thrown into the dull routine of the girl s life and her lively appreciation of it would add to his own triumph and pleasure i think he said to her with frank gravity that your foot needs a longer rest than you suppose now i am going to suggest a way in which you can give it that and at the same time do me a favour i was on my way to dine all by my lonely self when you came tumbling around the corner you come with me and we ll have a cozy dinner and a pleasant talk together and by that time your game ankle will carry you home very nicely i am sure the girl looked quickly up into chandler s clear pleasant countenance her eyes twinkled once very brightly and then she smiled ingenuously but we don t know each other it wouldn t be right would it she said doubtfully there is nothing wrong about it said the young man candidly i ll introduce myself permit me mr towers chandler after our dinner which i will try to make as pleasant as possible i will bid you good evening or attend you safely to your door whichever you prefer but dear me said the girl with a glance at chandler s faultless attire in this old dress and hat never mind that said chandler cheerfully i m sure you look more charming in them than any one we shall see in the most elaborate dinner toilette my ankle does hurt yet admitted the girl attempting a limping step i think i will accept your invitation mr chandler you may call me miss marian come then miss marian said the young architect gaily but with perfect courtesy you will not have far to walk there is a very respectable and good restaurant in the next block you will have to lean on my arm so and walk slowly it is lonely dining all by one s self i m just a little bit glad that you slipped on the ice when the two were established at a well appointed table with a promising waiter hovering in attendance chandler began to experience the real joy that his regular outing always brought to him the restaurant was not so showy or pretentious as the one further down broadway which he always preferred but it was nearly so the tables were well filled with prosperous looking diners there was a good orchestra playing softly enough to make conversation a possible pleasure and the cuisine and service were beyond criticism his companion even in her cheap hat and dress held herself with an air that added distinction to the natural beauty of her face and figure and it is certain that she looked at chandler with his animated but self possessed manner and his kindling and frank blue eyes with something not far from admiration in her own charming face then it was that the madness of manhattan the frenzy of fuss and feathers the bacillus of brag the provincial plague of pose seized upon towers chandler he was on broadway surrounded by pomp and style and there were eyes to look at him on the stage of that comedy he had assumed to play the one night part of a butterfly of fashion and an idler of means and taste he was dressed for the part and all his good angels had not the power to prevent him from acting it so he began to prate to miss marian of clubs of teas of golf and riding and kennels and cotillions and tours abroad and threw out hints of a yacht lying at larchmont he could see that she was vastly impressed by this vague talk so he endorsed his pose by random insinuations concerning great wealth and mentioned familiarly a few names that are handled reverently by the proletariat it was chandler s short little day and he was wringing from it the best that could be had as he saw it and yet once or twice he saw the pure gold of this girl shine through the mist that his egotism had raised between him and all objects this way of living that you speak of she said sounds so futile and purposeless haven t you any work to do in the world that might interest you more my dear miss marian he exclaimed work think of dressing every day for dinner of making half a dozen calls in an afternoon with a policeman at every corner ready to jump into your auto and take you to the station if you get up any greater speed than a donkey cart s gait we do nothings are the hardest workers in the land the dinner was concluded the waiter generously fed and the two walked out to the corner where they had met miss marian walked very well now her limp was scarcely noticeable thank you for a nice time she said frankly i must run home now i liked the dinner very much mr chandler he shook hands with her smiling cordially and said something about a game of bridge at his club he watched her for a moment walking rather rapidly eastward and then he found a cab to drive him slowly homeward in his chilly bedroom chandler laid away his evening clothes for a sixty nine days rest he went about it thoughtfully that was a stunning girl he said to himself she s all right too i d be sworn even if she does have to work perhaps if i d told her the truth instead of all that razzle dazzle we might but confound it i had to play up to my clothes thus spoke the brave who was born and reared in the wigwams of the tribe of the manhattans the girl after leaving her entertainer sped swiftly cross town until she arrived at a handsome and sedate mansion two squares to the east facing on that avenue which is the highway of mammon and the auxiliary gods here she entered hurriedly and ascended to a room where a handsome young lady in an elaborate house dress was looking anxiously out the window oh you madcap exclaimed the elder girl when the other entered when will you quit frightening us this way it is two hours since you ran out in that rag of an old dress and marie s hat mamma has been so alarmed she sent louis in the auto to try to find you you are a bad thoughtless puss the elder girl touched a button and a maid came in a moment marie tell mamma that miss marian has returned don t scold sister i only ran down to mme theo s to tell her to use mauve insertion instead of pink my costume and marie s hat were just what i needed every one thought i was a shopgirl i am sure dinner is over dear you stayed so late i know i slipped on the sidewalk and turned my ankle i could not walk so i hobbled into a restaurant and sat there until i was better that is why i was so long the two girls sat in the window seat looking out at the lights and the stream of hurrying vehicles in the avenue the younger one cuddled down with her head in her sister s lap we will have to marry some day she said dreamily both of us we have so much money that we will not be allowed to disappoint the public do you want me to tell you the kind of a man i could love sis go on you scatterbrain smiled the other i could love a man with dark and kind blue eyes who is gentle and respectful to poor girls who is handsome and good and does not try to flirt but i could love him only if he had an ambition an object some work to do in the world i would not care how poor he was if i could help him build his way up but sister dear the kind of man we always meet the man who lives an idle life between society and his clubs i could not love a man like that even if his eyes were blue and he were ever so kind to poor girls whom he met in the street by courier it was neither the season nor the hour when the park had frequenters and it is likely that the young lady who was seated on one of the benches at the side of the walk had merely obeyed a sudden impulse to sit for a while and enjoy a foretaste of coming spring she rested there pensive and still a certain melancholy that touched her countenance must have been of recent birth for it had not yet altered the fine and youthful contours of her cheek nor subdued the arch though resolute curve of her lips a tall young man came striding through the park along the path near which she sat behind him tagged a boy carrying a suit case at sight of the young lady the man s face changed to red and back to pale again he watched her countenance as he drew nearer with hope and anxiety mingled on his own he passed within a few yards of her but he saw no evidence that she was aware of his presence or existence some fifty yards further on he suddenly stopped and sat on a bench at one side the boy dropped the suit case and stared at him with wondering shrewd eyes the young man took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow it was a good handkerchief a good brow and the young man was good to look at he said to the boy i want you to take a message to that young lady on that bench tell her i am on my way to the station to leave for san francisco where i shall join that alaska moose hunting expedition tell her that since she has commanded me neither to speak nor to write to her i take this means of making one last appeal to her sense of justice for the sake of what has been tell her that to condemn and discard one who has not deserved such treatment without giving him her reasons or a chance to explain is contrary to her nature as i believe it to be tell her that i have thus to a certain degree disobeyed her injunctions in the hope that she may yet be inclined to see justice done go and tell her that the young man dropped a half dollar into the boy s hand the boy looked at him for a moment with bright canny eyes out of a dirty intelligent face and then set off at a run he approached the lady on the bench a little doubtfully but unembarrassed he touched the brim of the old plaid bicycle cap perched on the back of his head the lady looked at him coolly without prejudice or favour lady he said dat gent on de oder bench sent yer a song and dance by me if yer don t know de guy and he s tryin to do de johnny act say de word and i ll call a cop in t ree minutes if yer does know him and he s on de square w y i ll spiel yer de bunch of hot air he sent yer the young lady betrayed a faint interest a song and dance she said in a deliberate sweet voice that seemed to clothe her words in a diaphanous garment of impalpable irony a new idea in the troubadour line i suppose i used to know the gentleman who sent you so i think it will hardly be necessary to call the police you may execute your song and dance but do not sing too loudly it is a little early yet for open air vaudeville and we might attract attention awe said the boy with a shrug down the length of him yer know what i mean lady tain t a turn it s wind he told me to tell yer he s got his collars and cuffs in dat grip for a scoot clean out to frisco den he s goin to shoot snow birds in de klondike he says yer told him not to send round no more pink notes nor come hangin over de garden gate and he takes dis means of puttin yer wise he says yer refereed him out like a has been and never give him no chance to kick at de decision he says yer swiped him and never said why the slightly awakened interest in the young lady s eyes did not abate perhaps it was caused by either the originality or the audacity of the snow bird hunter in thus circumventing her express commands against the ordinary modes of communication she fixed her eye on a statue standing disconsolate in the dishevelled park and spoke into the transmitter tell the gentleman that i need not repeat to him a description of my ideals he knows what they have been and what they still are so far as they touch on this case absolute loyalty and truth are the ones paramount tell him that i have studied my own heart as well as one can and i know its weakness as well as i do its needs that is why i decline to hear his pleas whatever they may be i did not condemn him through hearsay or doubtful evidence and that is why i made no charge but since he persists in hearing what he already well knows you may convey the matter tell him that i entered the conservatory that evening from the rear to cut a rose for my mother tell him i saw him and miss ashburton beneath the pink oleander the tableau was pretty but the pose and juxtaposition were too eloquent and evident to require explanation i left the conservatory and at the same time the rose and my ideal you may carry that song and dance to your impresario i m shy on one word lady jux jux put me wise on dat will yer juxtaposition or you may call it propinquity or if you like being rather too near for one maintaining the position of an ideal the gravel spun from beneath the boy s feet he stood by the other bench the man s eyes interrogated him hungrily the boy s were shining with the impersonal zeal of the translator de lady says dat she s on to de fact dat gals is dead easy when a feller comes spielin ghost stories and tryin to make up and dat s why she won t listen to no soft soap she says she caught yer dead to rights huggin a bunch o calico in de hot house she side stepped in to pull some posies and yer was squeezin de oder gal to beat de band she says it looked cute all right all right but it made her sick she says yer better git busy and make a sneak for de train the young man gave a low whistle and his eyes flashed with a sudden thought his hand flew to the inside pocket of his coat and drew out a handful of letters selecting one he handed it to the boy following it with a silver dollar from his vest pocket give that letter to the lady he said and ask her to read it tell her that it should explain the situation tell her that if she had mingled a little trust with her conception of the ideal much heartache might have been avoided tell her that the loyalty she prizes so much has never wavered tell her i am waiting for an answer the messenger stood before the lady de gent says he s had de ski bunk put on him widout no cause he says he s no bum guy and lady yer read dat letter and i ll bet yer he s a white sport all right the young lady unfolded the letter somewhat doubtfully and read it dear dr arnold i want to thank you for your most kind and opportune aid to my daughter last friday evening when she was overcome by an attack of her old heart trouble in the conservatory at mrs waldron s reception had you not been near to catch her as she fell and to render proper attention we might have lost her i would be glad if you would call and undertake the treatment of her case gratefully yours robert ashburton the young lady refolded the letter and handed it to the boy de gent wants an answer said the messenger wot s de word the lady s eyes suddenly flashed on him bright smiling and wet tell that guy on the other bench she said with a happy tremulous laugh that his girl wants him the furnished room restless shifting fugacious as time itself is a certain vast bulk of the population of the red brick district of the lower west side homeless they have a hundred homes they flit from furnished room to furnished room transients forever transients in abode transients in heart and mind they sing home sweet home in ragtime they carry their lares et penates in a bandbox their vine is entwined about a picture hat a rubber plant is their fig tree hence the houses of this district having had a thousand dwellers should have a thousand tales to tell mostly dull ones no doubt but it would be strange if there could not be found a ghost or two in the wake of all these vagrant guests one evening after dark a young man prowled among these crumbling red mansions ringing their bells at the twelfth he rested his lean hand baggage upon the step and wiped the dust from his hatband and forehead the bell sounded faint and far away in some remote hollow depths to the door of this the twelfth house whose bell he had rung came a housekeeper who made him think of an unwholesome surfeited worm that had eaten its nut to a hollow shell and now sought to fill the vacancy with edible lodgers he asked if there was a room to let come in said the housekeeper her voice came from her throat her throat seemed lined with fur i have the third floor back vacant since a week back should you wish to look at it the young man followed her up the stairs a faint light from no particular source mitigated the shadows of the halls they trod noiselessly upon a stair carpet that its own loom would have forsworn it seemed to have become vegetable to have degenerated in that rank sunless air to lush lichen or spreading moss that grew in patches to the staircase and was viscid under the foot like organic matter at each turn of the stairs were vacant niches in the wall perhaps plants had once been set within them if so they had died in that foul and tainted air it may be that statues of the saints had stood there but it was not difficult to conceive that imps and devils had dragged them forth in the darkness and down to the unholy depths of some furnished pit below this is the room said the housekeeper from her furry throat it s a nice room it ain t often vacant i had some most elegant people in it last summer no trouble at all and paid in advance to the minute the water s at the end of the hall sprowls and mooney kept it three months they done a vaudeville sketch miss b retta sprowls you may have heard of her oh that was just the stage names right there over the dresser is where the marriage certificate hung framed the gas is here and you see there is plenty of closet room it s a room everybody likes it never stays idle long do you have many theatrical people rooming here asked the young man they comes and goes a good proportion of my lodgers is connected with the theatres yes sir this is the theatrical district actor people never stays long anywhere i get my share yes they comes and they goes he engaged the room paying for a week in advance he was tired he said and would take possession at once he counted out the money the room had been made ready she said even to towels and water as the housekeeper moved away he put for the thousandth time the question that he carried at the end of his tongue a young girl miss vashner miss eloise vashner do you remember such a one among your lodgers she would be singing on the stage most likely a fair girl of medium height and slender with reddish gold hair and a dark mole near her left eyebrow no i don t remember the name them stage people has names they change as often as their rooms they comes and they goes no i don t call that one to mind no always no five months of ceaseless interrogation and the inevitable negative so much time spent by day in questioning managers agents schools and choruses by night among the audiences of theatres from all star casts down to music halls so low that he dreaded to find what he most hoped for he who had loved her best had tried to find her he was sure that since her disappearance from home this great water girt city held her somewhere but it was like a monstrous quicksand shifting its particles constantly with no foundation its upper granules of to day buried to morrow in ooze and slime the furnished room received its latest guest with a first glow of pseudo hospitality a hectic haggard perfunctory welcome like the specious smile of a demirep the sophistical comfort came in reflected gleams from the decayed furniture the raggcd brocade upholstery of a couch and two chairs a footwide cheap pier glass between the two windows from one or two gilt picture frames and a brass bedstead in a corner the guest reclined inert upon a chair while the room confused in speech as though it were an apartment in babel tried to discourse to him of its divers tenantry a polychromatic rug like some brilliant flowered rectangular tropical islet lay surrounded by a billowy sea of soiled matting upon the gay papered wall were those pictures that pursue the homeless one from house to house the huguenot lovers the first quarrel the wedding breakfast psyche at the fountain the mantel s chastely severe outline was ingloriously veiled behind some pert drapery drawn rakishly askew like the sashes of the amazonian ballet upon it was some desolate flotsam cast aside by the room s marooned when a lucky sail had borne them to a fresh port a trifling vase or two pictures of actresses a medicine bottle some stray cards out of a deck one by one as the characters of a cryptograph become explicit the little signs left by the furnished room s procession of guests developed a significance the threadbare space in the rug in front of the dresser told that lovely woman had marched in the throng tiny finger prints on the wall spoke of little prisoners trying to feel their way to sun and air a splattered stain raying like the shadow of a bursting bomb witnessed where a hurled glass or bottle had splintered with its contents against the wall across the pier glass had been scrawled with a diamond in staggering letters the name marie it seemed that the succession of dwellers in the furnished room had turned in fury perhaps tempted beyond forbearance by its garish coldness and wreaked upon it their passions the furniture was chipped and bruised the couch distorted by bursting springs seemed a horrible monster that had been slain during the stress of some grotesque convulsion some more potent upheaval had cloven a great slice from the marble mantel each plank in the floor owned its particular cant and shriek as from a separate and individual agony it seemed incredible that all this malice and injury had been wrought upon the room by those who had called it for a time their home and yet it may have been the cheated home instinct surviving blindly the resentful rage at false household gods that had kindled their wrath a hut that is our own we can sweep and adorn and cherish the young tenant in the chair allowed these thoughts to file soft shod through his mind while there drifted into the room furnished sounds and furnished scents he heard in one room a tittering and incontinent slack laughter in others the monologue of a scold the rattling of dice a lullaby and one crying dully above him a banjo tinkled with spirit doors banged somewhere the elevated trains roared intermittently a cat yowled miserably upon a back fence and he breathed the breath of the house a dank savour rather than a smell a cold musty effluvium as from underground vaults mingled with the reeking exhalations of linoleum and mildewed and rotten woodwork then suddenly as he rested there the room was filled with the strong sweet odour of mignonette it came as upon a single buffet of wind with such sureness and fragrance and emphasis that it almost seemed a living visitant and the man cried aloud what dear as if he had been called and sprang up and faced about the rich odour clung to him and wrapped him around he reached out his arms for it all his senses for the time confused and commingled how could one be peremptorily called by an odour surely it must have been a sound but was it not the sound that had touched that had caressed him she has been in this room he cried and he sprang to wrest from it a token for he knew he would recognize the smallest thing that had belonged to her or that she had touched this enveloping scent of mignonette the odour that she had loved and made her own whence came it the room had been but carelessly set in order scattered upon the flimsy dresser scarf were half a dozen hairpins those discreet indistinguishable friends of womankind feminine of gender infinite of mood and uncommunicative of tense these he ignored conscious of their triumphant lack of identity ransacking the drawers of the dresser he came upon a discarded tiny ragged handkerchief he pressed it to his face it was racy and insolent with heliotrope he hurled it to the floor in another drawer he found odd buttons a theatre programme a pawnbroker s card two lost marshmallows a book on the divination of dreams in the last was a woman s black satin hair bow which halted him poised between ice and fire but the black satin hairbow also is femininity s demure impersonal common ornament and tells no tales and then he traversed the room like a hound on the scent skimming the walls considering the corners of the bulging matting on his hands and knees rummaging mantel and tables the curtains and hangngs the drunken cabinet in the corner for a visible sign unable to perceive that she was there beside around against within above him clinging to him wooing him calling him so poignantly through the finer senses that even his grosser ones became cognisant of the call once again he answered loudly yes dear and turned wild eyed to gaze on vacancy for he could not yet discern form and colour and love and outstretched arms in the odour of mnignonette oh god whence that odour and since when have odours had a voice to call thus he groped he burrowed in crevices and corners and found corks and cigarettes these he passed in passive contempt but once he found in a fold of the matting a half smoked cigar and this he ground beneath his heel with a green and trenchant oath he sifted the room from end to end he found dreary and ignoble small records of many a peripatetic tenant but of her whom he sought and who may have lodged there and whose spirit seemed to hover there he found no trace and then he thought of the housekeeper he ran from the haunted room downstairs and to a door that showed a crack of light she came out to his knock he smothered his excitement as best he could will you tell me madam he besought her who occupied the room i have before i came yes sir i can tell you again twas sprowls and mooney as i said miss b retta sprowls it was in the theatres but missis mooney she was my house is well known for respectability the marriage certificate hung framed on a nail over what kind of a lady was miss sprowls in looks i mean why black haired sir short and stout with a comical face they left a week ago tuesday and before they occupied it why there was a single gentleman connected with the draying business he left owing me a week before him was missis crowder and her two children that stayed four months and back of them was old mr doyle whose sons paid for him he kept the room six months that goes back a year sir and further i do not remember he thanked her and crept back to his room the room was dead the essence that had vivified it was gone the perfume of mignonette had departed in its place was the old stale odour of mouldy house furniture of atmosphere in storage the ebbing of his hope drained his faith he sat staring at the yellow singing gaslight soon he walked to the bed and began to tear the sheets into strips with the blade of his knife he drove them tightly into every crevice around windows and door when all was snug and taut he turned out the light turned the gas full on again and laid himself gratefully upon the bed it was mrs mccool s night to go with the can for beer so she fetched it and sat with mrs purdy in one of those subterranean retreats where house keepers foregather and the worm dieth seldom i rented out my third floor back this evening said mrs purdy across a fine circle of foam a young man took it he went up to bed two hours ago now did ye mrs purdy ma am said mrs mccool with intense admiration you do be a wonder for rentin rooms of that kind and did ye tell him then she concluded in a husky whisper laden with mystery rooms said mrs purdy in her furriest tones are furnished for to rent i did not tell him mrs mccool tis right ye are ma am tis by renting rooms we kape alive ye have the rale sense for business ma am there be many people will rayjict the rentin of a room if they be tould a suicide has been after dyin in the bed of it as you say we has our living to be making remarked mrs purdy yis ma am tis true tis just one wake ago this day i helped ye lay out the third floor back a pretty slip of a colleen she was to be killin herself wid the gas a swate little face she had mrs purdy ma am she d a been called handsome as you say said mrs purdy assenting but critical but for that mole she had a growin by her left eyebrow do fill up your glass again mrs mccool the brief debut of tildy if you do not know bogle s chop house and family restaurant it is your loss for if you are one of the fortunate ones who dine expensively you should be interested to know how the other half consumes provisions and if you belong to the half to whom waiters checks are things of moment you should know bogle s for there you get your money s worth in quantity at least bogle s is situated in that highway of bourgeoisie that boulevard of brown jones and robinson eighth avenue there are two rows of tables in the room six in each row on each table is a caster stand containing cruets of condiments and seasons from the pepper cruet you may shake a cloud of something tasteless and melancholy like volcanic dust from the salt cruet you may expect nothing though a man should extract a sanguinary stream from the pallid turnip yet wili his prowess be balked when he comes to wrest salt from bogle s cruets also upon each table stands the counterfeit of that benign sauce made from the recipe of a nobleman in india at the cashier s desk sits bogle cold sordid slow smouldering and takes your money behind a mountain of toothpicks he makes your change files your check and ejects at you like a toad a word about the weather beyond a corroboration of his meteorological statement you would better not venture you are not bogle s friend you are a fed transient customer and you and he may not meet again until the blowing of gabriel s dinner horn so take your change and go to the devil if you like there you have bogle s sentiments the needs of bogle s customers were supplied by two waitresses and a voice one of the waitresses was named aileen she was tall beautiful lively gracious and learned in persiflage her other name there was no more necessity for another name at bogle s than there was for finger bowls the name of the other waitress was tildy why do you suggest matilda please listen this time tildy tildy tildy was dumpy plain faced and too anxious to please to please repeat the last clause to yourself once or twice and make the acquaintance of the duplicate infinite the voice at bogle s was invisible it came from the kitchen and did not shine in the way of originality it was a heathen voice and contented itself with vain repetitions of exclamations emitted by the waitresses concerning food will it tire you to be told again that aileen was beautiful had she donned a few hundred dollars worth of clothes and joined the easter parade and had you seen her you would have hastened to say so yourself the customers at bogle s were her slaves six tables full she could wait upon at once they who were in a hurry restrained their impatience for the joy of merely gazing upon her swiftly moving graceful figure they who had finished eating ate more that they might continue in the light of her smiles every man there and they were mostly men tried to make his impression upon her aileen could successfully exchange repartee against a dozen at once and every smile that she sent forth lodged like pellets from a scatter gun in as many hearts and all this while she would be performing astounding feats with orders of pork and beans pot roasts ham and sausage and the wheats and any quantity of things on the iron and in the pan and straight up and on the side with all this feasting and flirting and merry exchange of wit bogle s came mighty near being a salon with aileen for its madame recamier if the transients were entranced by the fascinating aileen the regulars were her adorers there was much rivalry among many of the steady customers aileen could have had an engagement every evening at least twice a week some one took her to a theatre or to a dance one stout gentleman whom she and tildy had privately christened the hog presented her with a turquoise ring another one known as fresby who rode on the traction company s repair wagon was going to give her a poodle as soon as his brother got the hauling contract in the ninth and the man who always ate spareribs and spinach and said he was a stock broker asked her to go to parsifal with him i don t know where this place is said aileen while talking it over with tildy but the wedding ring s got to be on before i put a stitch into a travelling dress ain t that right well i guess but tildy in steaming chattering cabbage scented bogle s there was almost a heart tragedy tildy with the blunt nose the hay coloured hair the freckled skin the bag o meal figure had never had an admirer not a man followed her with his eyes when she went to and fro in the restaurant save now and then when they glared with the beast hunger for food none of them bantered her gaily to coquettish interchanges of wit none of them loudly jollied her of mornings as they did aileen accusing her when the eggs were slow in coming of late hours in the company of envied swains no one had ever given her a turquoise ring or invited her upon a voyage to mysterious distant parsifal tildy was a good waitress and the men tolerated her they who sat at her tables spoke to her briefly with quotations from the bill of fare and then raised their voices in honeyed and otherwise flavoured accents eloquently addressed to the fair aileen they writhed in their chairs to gaze around and over the impending form of tildy that aileen s pulchritude might season and make ambrosia of their bacon and eggs and tildy was content to be the unwooed drudge if aileen could receive the flattery and the homage the blunt nose was loyal to the short grecian she was aileen s friend and she was glad to see her rule hearts and wean the attention of men from smoking pot pie and lemon meringue but deep below our freckles and hay coloured hair the unhandsomest of us dream of a prince or a princess not vicarious but coming to us alone there was a morning when aileen tripped in to work with a slightly bruised eye and tildy s solicitude was almost enough to heal any optic fresh guy explained aileen last night as i was going home at twenty third and sixth sashayed up so he did and made a break i turned him down cold and he made a sneak but followed me down to eighteenth and tried his hot air again gee but i slapped him a good one side of the face then he give me that eye does it look real awful til i should hate that mr nicholson should see it when he comes in for his tea and toast at ten tildy listened to the adventure with breathless admiration no man had ever tried to follow her she was safe abroad at any hour of the twenty four what bliss it must have been to have had a man follow one and black one s eye for love among the customers at bogle s was a young man named seeders who worked in a laundry office mr seeders was thin and had light hair and appeared to have been recently rough dried and starched he was too diffident to aspire to aileen s notice so he usually sat at one of tildy s tables where he devoted himself to silence and boiled weakfish one day when mr seeders came in to dinner he had been drinking beer there were only two or three customers in the restaurant when mr seeders had finished his weakfish he got up put his arm around tildy s waist kissed her loudly and impudently walked out upon the street snapped his fingers in the direction of the laundry and hied himself to play pennies in the slot machines at the amusement arcade for a few moments tildy stood petrified then she was aware of aileen shaking at her an arch forefinger and saying why til you naughty girl ain t you getting to be awful miss slyboots first thing i know you ll be stealing some of my fellows i must keep an eye on you my lady another thing dawned upon tildy s recovering wits in a moment she had advanced from a hopeless lowly admirer to be an eve sister of the potent aileen she herself was now a man charmer a mark for cupid a sabine who must be coy when the romans were at their banquet boards man had found her waist achievable and her lips desirable the sudden and amatory seeders had as it were performed for her a miraculous piece of one day laundry work he had taken the sackcloth of her uncomeliness had washed dried starched and ironed it and returned it to her sheer embroidered lawn the robe of venus herself the freckles on tildy s cheeks merged into a rosy flush now both circe and psyche peeped from her brightened eyes not even aileen herself had been publicly embraced and kissed in the restaurant tildy could not keep the delightful secret when trade was slack she went and stood at bogle s desk her eyes were shining she tried not to let her words sound proud and boastful a gentleman insulted me to day she said he hugged me around the waist and kissed me that so said bogle cracking open his business armour after this week you get a dollar a week more at the next regular meal when tildy set food before customers with whom she had acquaintance she said to each of them modestly as one whose merit needed no bolstering a gentleman insulted me to day in the restaurant he put his arm around my waist and kissed me the diners accepted the revelation in various ways some incredulously some with congratulations others turned upon her the stream of badinage that had hitherto been directed at aileen alone and tildy s heart swelled in her bosom for she saw at last the towers of romance rise above the horizon of the grey plain in which she had for so long travelled for two days mr seeders came not again during that time tildy established herself firmly as a woman to be wooed she bought ribbons and arranged her hair like aileen s and tightened her waist two inches she had a thrilling but delightful fear that mr seeders would rush in suddenly and shoot her with a pistol he must have loved her desperately and impulsive lovers are always blindly jealous even aileen had not been shot at with a pistol and then tildy rather hoped that he would not shoot at her for she was always loyal to aileen and she did not want to overshadow her friend at o clock on the afternoon of the third day mr seeders came in there were no customers at the tables at the back end of the restaurant tildy was refilling the mustard pots and aileen was quartering pies mr seeders walked back to where they stood tildy looked up and saw him gasped and pressed the mustard spoon against her heart a red hair bow was in her hair she wore venus s eighth avenue badge the blue bead necklace with the swinging silver symbolic heart mr seeders was flushed and embarrassed he plunged one hand into his hip pocket and the other into a fresh pumpkin pie miss tildy said he i want to apologise for what i done the other evenin tell you the truth i was pretty well tanked up or i wouldn t of done it i wouldn t do no lady that a way when i was sober so i hope miss tildy you ll accept my pology and believe that i wouldn t of done it if i d known what i was doin and hadn t of been drunk with this handsome plea mr seeders backed away and departed feeling that reparation had been made but behind the convenient screen tildy had thrown herself flat upon a table among the butter chips and the coffee cups and was sobbing her heart out out and back again to the grey plain wherein travel they with blunt noses and hay coloured hair from her knot she had torn the red hair bow and cast it upon the floor seeders she despised utterly she had but taken his kiss as that of a pioneer and prophetic prince who might have set the clocks going and the pages to running in fairyland but the kiss had been maudlin and unmeant the court had not stirred at the false alarm she must forevermore remain the sleeping beauty yet not all was lost aileen s arm was around her and tildy s red hand groped among the butter chips till it found the warm clasp of her friend s don t you fret til said aileen who did not understand entirely that turnip faced little clothespin of a seeders ain t worth it he ain t anything of a gentleman or he wouldn t ever of apologised the gentle grafter the octopus marooned a trust is its weakest point said jeff peters that said i sounds like one of those unintelligible remarks such as why is a policeman it is not said jeff there are no relations between a trust and a policeman my remark was an epitogram an axis a kind of mulct em in parvo what it means is that a trust is like an egg and it is not like an egg if you want to break an egg you have to do it from the outside the only way to break up a trust is from the inside keep sitting on it until it hatches look at the brood of young colleges and libraries that s chirping and peeping all over the country yes sir every trust bears in its own bosom the seeds of its destruction like a rooster that crows near a georgia colored methodist camp meeting or a republican announcing himself a candidate for governor of texas i asked jeff jestingly if he had ever during his checkered plaided mottled pied and dappled career conducted an enterprise of the class to which the word trust had been applied somewhat to my surprise he acknowledged the corner once said he and the state seal of new jersey never bit into a charter that opened up a solider and safer piece of legitimate octopusing we had everything in our favor wind water police nerve and a clean monopoly of an article indispensable to the public there wasn t a trust buster on the globe that could have found a weak spot in our scheme it made rockefeller s little kerosene speculation look like a bucket shop but we lost out some unforeseen opposition came up i suppose i said no sir it was just as i said we were self curbed it was a case of auto suppression there was a rift within the loot as albert tennyson says you remember i told you that me and andy tucker was partners for some years that man was the most talented conniver at stratagems i ever saw whenever he saw a dollar in another man s hands he took it as a personal grudge if he couldn t take it any other way andy was educated too besides having a lot of useful information he had acquired a big amount of experience out of books and could talk for hours on any subject connected with ideas and discourse he had been in every line of graft from lecturing on palestine with a lot of magic lantern pictures of the annual custom made clothiers association convention at atlantic city to flooding connecticut with bogus wood alcohol distilled from nutmegs one spring me and andy had been over in mexico on a flying trip during which a philadelphia capitalist had paid us for a half interest in a silver mine in chihuahua oh yes the mine was all right the other half interest must have been worth two or three thousand i often wondered who owned that mine in coming back to the united states me and andy stubbed our toes against a little town in texas on the bank of the rio grande the name of it was bird city but it wasn t the town had about inhabitants mostly men i figured out that their principal means of existence was in living close to tall chaparral some of em were stockmen and some gamblers and some horse peculators and plenty were in the smuggling line me and andy put up at a hotel that was built like something between a roof garden and a sectional bookcase it began to rain the day we got there as the saying is juniper aquarius was sure turning on the water plugs on mount amphibious now there were three saloons in bird city though neither andy nor me drank but we could see the townspeople making a triangular procession from one to another all day and half the night everybody seemed to know what to do with as much money as they had the third day of the rain it slacked up awhile in the afternoon so me and andy walked out to the edge of town to view the mudscape bird city was built between the rio grande and a deep wide arroyo that used to be the old bed of the river the bank between the stream and its old bed was cracking and giving away when we saw it on account of the high water caused by the rain andy looks at it a long time that man s intellects was never idle and then he unfolds to me a instantaneous idea that has occurred to him right there was organized a trust and we walked back into town and put it on the market first we went to the main saloon in bird city called the blue snake and bought it it cost us and then we dropped in casual at mexican joe s place referred to the rain and bought him out for the other one came easy at the next morning bird city woke up and found itself an island the river had busted through its old channel and the town was surrounded by roaring torrents the rain was still raining and there was heavy clouds in the northwest that presaged about six more mean annual rainfalls during the next two weeks but the worst was yet to come bird city hopped out of its nest waggled its pin feathers and strolled out for its matutinal toot lo mexican joe s place was closed and likewise the other little dobe life saving station so naturally the body politic emits thirsty ejaculations of surprise and ports hellum for the blue snake and what does it find there behind one end of the bar sits jefferson peters octopus with a sixshooter on each side of him ready to make change or corpses as the case may be there are three bartenders and on the wall is a ten foot sign reading all drinks one dollar andy sits on the safe in his neat blue suit and gold banded cigar on the lookout for emergencies the town marshal is there with two deputies to keep order having been promised free drinks by the trust well sir it took bird city just ten minutes to realize that it was in a cage we expected trouble but there wasn t any the citizens saw that we had em the nearest railroad was thirty miles away and it would be two weeks at least before the river would be fordable so they began to cuss amiable and throw down dollars on the bar till it sounded like a selection on the xylophone there was about grown up adults in bird city that had arrived at years of indiscretion and the majority of em required from three to twenty drinks a day to make life endurable the blue snake was the only place where they could get em till the flood subsided it was beautiful and simple as all truly great swindles are about ten o clock the silver dollars dropping on the bar slowed down to playing two steps and marches instead of jigs but i looked out the window and saw a hundred or two of our customers standing in line at bird city savings and loan co and i knew they were borrowing more money to be sucked in by the clammy tendrils of the octopus at the fashionable hour of noon everybody went home to dinner we told the bartenders to take advantage of the lull and do the same then me and andy counted the receipts we had taken in we calculated that if bird city would only remain an island for two weeks the trust would be able to endow the chicago university with a new dormitory of padded cells for the faculty and present every worthy poor man in texas with a farm provided he furnished the site for it andy was especial inroaded by self esteem at our success the rudiments of the scheme having originated in his own surmises and premonitions he got off the safe and lit the biggest cigar in the house jeff says he i don t suppose that anywhere in the world you could find three cormorants with brighter ideas about down treading the proletariat than the firm of peters satan and tucker incorporated we have sure handed the small consumer a giant blow in the sole apoplectic region no well says i it does look as if we would have to take up gastritis and golf or be measured for kilts in spite of ourselves this little turn in bug juice is verily all to the skibo and i can stand it says i i d rather batten

but i m awfully busy and i know you ll excuse me i ve got an ambassadorship two consulates and a dozen other minor applications to look after i can hardly find time to sleep at all you ll give my compliments to mr humble when you get home of course well i handed her the which she pitched into her desk drawer without counting i put bill s appointment in my pocket and me and andy made our adieus we started back for the territory the same day we wired bill job landed get the tall glasses ready and we felt pretty good andy joshed me all the way about how little i knew about women all right says i i ll admit that she surprised me but it s the first time i ever knew one of em to manipulate a piece of business on time without getting it bungled up in some way says i down about the edge of arkansas i got out bill s appointment and looked it over and then i handed it to andy to read andy read it but didn t add any remarks to my silence the paper was for bill all right and a genuine document but it appointed him postmaster of dade city fla me and andy got off the train at little rock and sent bill s appointment to him by mail then we struck northeast toward lake superior i never saw bill humble after that the exact science of matrimony as i have told you before said jeff peters i never had much confidence in the perfidiousness of woman as partners or coeducators in the most innocent line of graft they are not trustworthy they deserve the compliment said i i think they are entitled to be called the honest sex why shouldn t they be said jeff they ve got the other sex either grafting or working overtime for em they re all right in business until they get their emotions or their hair touched up too much then you want to have a flat footed heavy breathing man with sandy whiskers five kids and a building and loan mortgage ready as an understudy to take her desk now there was that widow lady that me and andy tucker engaged to help us in that little matrimonial agency scheme we floated out in cairo when you ve got enough advertising capital say a roll as big as the little end of a wagon tongue there s money in matrimonial agencies we had about and we expected to double it in two months which is about as long as a scheme like ours can be carried on without taking out a new jersey charter we fixed up an advertisement that read about like this charming widow beautiful home loving years possessing cash and owning valuable country property would remarry would prefer a poor man with affectionate disposition to one with means as she realizes that the solid virtues are oftenest to be found in the humble walks of life no objection to elderly man or one of homely appearance if faithful and true and competent to manage property and invest money with judgment address with particulars lonely care of peters tucker agents cairo ill so far so pernicious says i when we had finished the literary concoction and now says i where is the lady andy gives me one of his looks of calm irritation jeff says he i thought you had lost them ideas of realism in your art why should there be a lady when they sell a lot of watered stock on wall street would you expect to find a mermaid in it what has a matrimonial ad got to do with a lady now listen says i you know my rule andy that in all my illegitimate inroads against the legal letter of the law

the catalogue and writ of errors or hereafter be held by a justice of the peace well says andy reconstructing his mind maybe it would be safer in case the post office or the peace commission should

liniment that he always got boozed up on i used to stop at their house often and i thought we could get her to work with us twas only sixty miles to the little town where she lived so i jumped out on the i c and finds her in the same cottage with the same sunflowers and roosters standing on the washtub mrs trotter fitted our ad first rate except maybe for beauty and age and property valuation but she looked feasible and praiseworthy to the eye and it was a kindness to zeke s memory to give her the job is this an honest deal you are putting on mr peters she asks me when i tell her what we want

burro cavalcade laden with the treasure started from an old spanish mission in dolores county they travelled due south by the compass until they reached the alamito river they forded this and buried the treasure on the top of a little mountain shaped like a pack saddle standing in a row between two higher ones a heap of stones marked the place of the buried treasure all the party except the spanish priest were killed by indians a few days later the secret was a monopoly it looked good to me lee rundle suggested that we rig out a camping outfit hire a surveyor to run out the line from the spanish mission and then spend the three hundred thousand dollars seeing the sights in fort worth but without being highly educated i knew a way to save time and expense we went to the state land office and had a practical what they call a working sketch made of all the surveys of land from the old mission to the alamito river on this map i drew a line due southward to the river the length of lines of each survey and section of land was accurately given on the sketch by these we found the point on the river and had a connection made with it and an important well identified corner of the los animos five league survey a grant made by king philip of spain by doing this we did not need to have the line run out by a surveyor it was a great saving of expense and time so lee rundle and i fitted out a two horse wagon team with all the accessories and drove a hundred and forty nine miles to chico the nearest town to the point we wished to reach there we picked up a deputy county surveyor he found the corner of the los animos survey for us ran out the five thousand seven hundred and twenty varas west that our sketch called for laid a stone on the spot had coffee and bacon and caught the mail stage back to chico i was pretty sure we would get that three hundred thousand dollars lee rundle s was to be only one third because i was paying all the expenses with that two hundred thousand dollars i knew i could find may martha mangum if she was on earth and with it i could flutter the butterflies in old man mangum s dove cot too if i could find that treasure but lee and i established camp across the river were a dozen little mountains densely covered by cedar brakes but not one shaped like a pack saddle that did not deter us appearances are deceptive a pack saddle like beauty may exist only in the eye of the beholder i and the grandson of the treasure examined those cedar covered hills with the care of a lady hunting for the wicked flea we explored every side top circumference mean elevation angle slope and concavity of every one for two miles up and down the river we spent four days doing so then we hitched up the roan and the dun and hauled the remains of the coffee and bacon the one hundred and forty nine miles back to concho city lee rundle chewed much tobacco on the return trip i was busy driving because i was in a hurry as shortly as could be after our empty return goodloe banks and i forgathered in the back room of snyder s saloon to play dominoes and fish for information i told goodloe about my expedition after the buried treasure if i could have found that three hundred thousand dollars i said to him i could have scoured and sifted the surface of the earth to find may martha mangum she is meant for higher things said goodloe i shall find her myself but tell me how you went about discovering the spot where this unearthed increment was imprudently buried i told him in the smallest detail i showed him the draughtsman s sketch with the distances marked plainly upon it after glancing over it in a masterly way he leaned back in his chair and bestowed upon me an explosion of sardonic superior collegiate laughter well you are a fool jim he said when he could speak it s your play said i patiently fingering my double six twenty said goodloe making two crosses on the table with his chalk why am i a fool i asked buried treasure has been found before in many places because said he in calculating the point on the river where your line would strike you neglected to allow for the variation the variation there would be nine degrees west let me have your pencil goodloe banks figured rapidly on the back of an envelope the distance from north to south of the line run from the spanish mission said he is exactly twenty two miles it was run by a pocket compass according to your story allowing for the variation the point on the alamito river where you should have searched for your treasure is exactly six miles and nine hundred and forty five varas farther west than the place you hit upon oh what a fool you are jim what is this variation that you speak of i asked i thought figures never lied the variation of the magnetic compass said goodloe from the true meridian he smiled in his superior way and then i saw come out in his face the singular eager consuming cupidity of the seeker after buried treasure sometimes he said with the air of the oracle these old traditions of hidden money are not without foundation suppose you let me look over that paper describing the location perhaps together we might the result was that goodloe banks and i rivals in love became companions in adventure we went to chico by stage from huntersburg the nearest railroad town in chico we hired a team drawing a covered spring wagon and camping paraphernalia we had the same surveyor run out our distance as revised by goodloe and his variations and then dismissed him and sent him on his homeward road it was night when we arrived i fed the horses and made a fire near the bank of the river and cooked supper goodloe would have helped but his education had not fitted him for practical things but while i worked he cheered me with the expression of great thoughts handed down from the dead ones of old he quoted some translations from the greek at much length anacreon he explained that was a favorite passage with miss mangum as i recited it she is meant for higher things said i repeating his phrase can there be anything higher asked goodloe than to dwell in the society of the classics to live in the atmosphere of learning and culture you have often decried education what of your wasted efforts through your ignorance of simple mathematics how soon would you have found your treasure if my knowledge had not shown you your error we ll take a look at those hills across the river first said i and see what we find i am still doubtful about variations i have been brought up to believe that the needle is true to the pole the next morning was a bright june one we were up early and had breakfast goodloe was charmed he recited keats i think it was and kelly or shelley while i broiled the bacon we were getting ready to cross the river which was little more than a shallow creek there and explore the many sharp peaked cedar covered hills on the other side my good ulysses said goodloe slapping me on the shoulder while i was washing the tin breakfast plates let me see the enchanted document once more i believe it gives directions for climbing the hill shaped like a pack saddle i never saw a pack saddle what is it like jim score one against culture said i i ll know it when i see it goodloe was looking at old rundle s document when he ripped out a most uncollegiate swear word come here he said holding the paper up against the sunlight look at that he said laying his finger against it on the blue paper a thing i had never noticed before i saw stand out in white letters the word and figures malvern what about it i asked it s the water mark said goodloe the paper was manufactured in the writing on the paper is dated this is a palpable fraud oh i don t know said i the rundles are pretty reliable plain uneducated country people maybe the paper manufacturers tried to perpetrate a swindle and then goodloe banks went as wild as his education permitted he dropped the glasses off his nose and glared at me i ve often told you you were a fool he said you have let yourself be imposed upon by a clodhopper and you have imposed upon me how i asked have i imposed upon you by your ignorance said he twice i have discovered serious flaws in your plans that a common school education should have enabled you to avoid and he continued i have been put to expense that i could ill afford in pursuing this swindling quest i am done with it i rose and pointed a large pewter spoon at him fresh from the dish water goodloe banks i said i care not one parboiled navy bean for your education i always barely tolerated it in any one and i despised it in you what has your learning done for you it is a curse to yourself and a bore to your friends away i said away with your water marks and variations they are nothing to me they shall not deflect me from the quest i pointed with my spoon across the river to a small mountain shaped like a pack saddle i am going to search that mountain i went on for the treasure decide now whether you are in it or not if you wish to let a water mark or a variation shake your soul you are no true adventurer decide a white cloud of dust began to rise far down the river road it was the mail wagon from hesperus to chico goodloe flagged it i am done with the swindle said he sourly no one but a fool would pay any attention to that paper now well you always were a fool jim i leave you to your fate he gathered his personal traps climbed into the mail wagon adjusted his glasses nervously and flew away in a cloud of dust after i had washed the dishes and staked the horses on new grass i crossed the shallow river and made my way slowly through the cedar brakes up to the top of the hill shaped like a pack saddle it was a wonderful june day never in my life had i seen so many birds so many butter flies dragon flies grasshoppers and such winged and stinged beasts of the air and fields i investigated the hill shaped like a pack saddle from base to summit i found an absolute absence of signs relating to buried treasure there was no pile of stones no ancient blazes on the trees none of the evidences of the three hundred thousand dollars as set forth in the document of old man rundle i came down the hill in the cool of the afternoon suddenly out of the cedar brake i stepped into a beautiful green valley where a tributary small stream ran into the alamito river and there i was started to see what i took to be a wild man with unkempt beard and ragged hair pursuing a giant butterfly with brilliant wings perhaps he is an escaped madman i thought and wondered how he had strayed so far from seats of education and learning and then i took a few more steps and saw a vine covered cottage near the small stream and in a little grassy glade i saw may martha mangum plucking wild flowers she straightened up and looked at me for the first time since i knew her i saw her face which was the color of the white keys of a new piano turn pink i walked toward her without a word she let the gathered flowers trickle slowly from her hand to the grass i knew you would come jim she said clearly father wouldn t let me write but i knew you would come what followed you may guess there was my wagon and team just across the river i ve often wondered what good too much education is to a man if he can t use it for himself if all the benefits of it are to go to others where does it come in for may martha mangum abides with me there is an eight room house in a live oak grove and a piano with an automatic player and a good start toward the three thousand head of cattle is under fence and when i ride home at night my pipe and slippers are put away in places where they cannot be found but who cares for that who cares who cares to him who waits the hermit of the hudson was hustling about his cave with unusual animation the cave was on or in the top of a little spur of the catskills that had strayed down to the river s edge and not having a ferry ticket had to stop there the bijou mountains were densely wooded and were infested by ferocious squirrels and woodpeckers that forever menaced the summer transients like a badly sewn strip of white braid a macadamized road ran between the green skirt of the hills and the foamy lace of the river s edge a dim path wound from the comfortable road up a rocky height to the hermit s cave one mile upstream was the viewpoint inn to which summer folk from the city came leaving cool electric fanned apartments that they might be driven about in burning sunshine shrieking in gasoline launches by spindle legged modreds bearing the blankest of shields train your lorgnette upon the hermit and let your eye receive the personal touch that shall endear you to the hero a man of forty judging him fairly with long hair curling at the ends dramatic eyes and a forked brown beard like those that were imposed upon the west some years ago by self appointed divine healers who succeeded the grasshopper crop his outward vesture appeared to be kind of gunny sacking cut and made into a garment that would have made the fortune of a london tailor his long well shaped fingers delicate nose and poise of manner raised him high above the class of hermits who fear water and bury money in oyster cans in their caves in spots indicated by rude crosses chipped in the stone wall above the hermit s home was not altogether a cave the cave was an addition to the hermitage which was a rude hut made of poles daubed with clay and covered with the best quality of rust proof zinc roofing in the house proper there were stone slabs for seats a rustic bookcase made of unplaned poplar planks and a table formed of a wooden slab laid across two upright pieces of granite something between the furniture of a druid temple and that of a broadway beefsteak dungeon hung against the walls were skins of wild animals purchased in the vicinity of eighth street and university place new york the rear of the cabin merged into the cave there the hermit cooked his meals on a rude stone hearth with infinite patience and an old axe he had chopped natural shelves in the rocky walls on them stood his stores of flour bacon lard talcum powder kerosene baking powder soda mint tablets pepper salt and olivo cremo emulsion for chaps and roughness of the hands and face the hermit had hermited there for ten years he was an asset of the viewpoint inn to its guests he was second in interest only to the mysterious echo in the haunted glen and the lover s leap beat him only a few inches flat footed he was known far but not very wide on account of the topography as a scholar of brilliant intellect who had forsworn the world because he had been jilted in a love affair every saturday night the viewpoint inn sent to him surreptitiously a basket of provisions he never left the immediate outskirts of his hermitage guests of the inn who visited him said his store of knowledge wit and scintillating philosophy were simply wonderful you know that summer the viewpoint inn was crowded with guests so on saturday nights there were extra cans of tomatoes and sirloin steak instead of rounds in the hermit s basket now you have the material allegations in the case so make way for romance evidently the hermit expected a visitor he carefully combed his long hair and parted his apostolic beard when the ninety eight cent alarm clock on a stone shelf announced the hour of five he picked up his gunny sacking skirts brushed them carefully gathered an oaken staff and strolled slowly into the thick woods that surrounded the hermitage he had not long to wait up the faint pathway slippery with its carpet of pine needles toiled beatrix youngest and fairest of the famous trenholme sisters she was all in blue from hat to canvas pumps varying in tint from the shade of the tinkle of a bluebell at daybreak on a spring saturday to the deep hue of a monday morning at nine when the washer woman has failed to show up beatrix dug her cerulean parasol deep into the pine needles and sighed the hermit on the q t removed a grass burr from the ankle of one sandalled foot with the big toe of his other one she blued and almost starched and ironed him with her cobalt eyes it must be so nice she said in little tremulous gasps to be a hermit and have ladies climb mountains to talk to you the hermit folded his arms and leaned against a tree beatrix with a sigh settled down upon the mat of pine needles like a bluebird upon her nest the hermit followed suit drawing his feet rather awkwardly under his gunny sacking it must be nice to be a mountain said he with ponderous lightness and have angels in blue climb up you instead of flying over you mamma had neuralgia said beatrix and went to bed or i couldn t have come it s dreadfully hot at that horrid old inn but we hadn t the money to go anywhere else this summer last night said the hermit i climbed to the top of that big rock above us i could see the lights of the inn and hear a strain or two of the music when the wind was right i imagined you moving gracefully in the arms of others to the dreamy music of the waltz amid the fragrance of flowers think how lonely i must have been the youngest handsomest and poorest of the famous trenholme sisters sighed you haven t quite hit it she said plaintively i was moving gracefully at the arms of another mamma had one of her periodical attacks of rheumatism in both elbows and shoulders and i had to rub them for an hour with that horrid old liniment i hope you didn t think that smelled like flowers you know there were some west point boys and a yachtload of young men from the city at last evening s weekly dance i ve known mamma to sit by an open window for three hours with one half of her registering degrees and the other half frostbitten and never sneeze once but just let a bunch of ineligibles come around where i am and she ll begin to swell at the knuckles and shriek with pain and i have to take her to her room and rub her arms to see mamma dressed you d be surprised to know the number of square inches of surface there are to her arms i think it must be delightful to be a hermit that cassock gabardine isn t it that you wear is so becoming do you make it or them of course you must have changes yourself and what a blessed relief it must be to wear sandals instead of shoes think how we must suffer no matter how small i buy my shoes they always pinch my toes oh why can t there be lady hermits too the beautifulest and most adolescent trenholme sister extended two slender blue ankles that ended in two enormous blue silk bows that almost concealed two fairy oxfords also of one of the forty seven shades of blue the hermit as if impelled by a kind of reflex telepathic action drew his bare toes farther beneath his gunny sacking i have heard about the romance of your life said miss trenholme softly they have it printed on the back of the menu card at the inn was she very beautiful and charming on the bills of fare muttered the hermit but what do i care for the world s babble yes she was of the highest and grandest type then he continued then i thought the world could never contain another equal to her so i forsook it and repaired to this mountain fastness to spend the remainder of my life alone to devote and dedicate my remaining years to her memory it s grand said miss trenholme absolutely grand i think a hermit s life is the ideal one no bill collectors calling no dressing for dinner how i d like to be one but there s no such luck for me if i don t marry this season i honestly believe mamma will force me into settlement work or trimming hats it isn t because i m getting old or ugly but we haven t enough money left to butt in at any of the swell places any more and i don t want to marry unless it s somebody i like that s why i d like to be a hermit hermits don t ever marry do they hundreds of em said the hermit when they ve found the right one but they re hermits said the youngest and beautifulest because they ve lost the right one aren t they because they think they have answered the recluse fatuously wisdom comes to one in a mountain cave as well as to one in the world of swells as i believe they are called in the argot when one of the swells brings it to them said miss trenholme and my folks are swells that s the trouble but there are so many swells at the seashore in the summer time that we hardly amount to more than ripples so we ve had to put all our money into river and harbor appropriations we were all girls you know there were four of us i m the only surviving one the others have been married off all to money mamma is so proud of my sisters they send her the loveliest pen wipers and art calendars every christmas i m the only one on the market now i m forbidden to look at any one who hasn t money but began the hermit but oh said the beautifulest of course hermits have great pots of gold and doubloons buried somewhere near three great oak trees they all have i have not said the hermit regretfully i m so sorry said miss trenholme i always thought they had i think i must go now oh beyond question she was the beautifulest fair lady began the hermit i am beatrix trenholme some call me trix she said you must come to the inn to see me i haven t been a stone s throw from my cave in ten years said the hermit you must come to see me there she repeated any evening except thursday the hermit smiled weakly good bye she said gathering the folds of her pale blue skirt i shall expect you but not on thursday evening remember what an interest it would give to the future menu cards of the viewpoint inn to have these printed lines added to them only once during the more than ten years of his lonely existence did the mountain hermit leave his famous cave that was when he was irresistibly drawn to the inn by the fascinations of miss beatrix trenholme youngest and most beautiful of the celebrated trenholme sisters whose brilliant marriage to aye to whom the hermit walked back to the hermitage at the door stood bob binkley his old friend and companion of the days before he had renounced the world bob himself arrayed like the orchids of the greenhouse in the summer man s polychromatic garb bob the millionaire with his fat firm smooth shrewd face his diamond rings sparkling fob chain and pleated bosom he was two years older than the hermit and looked five years younger you re hamp ellison in spite of those whiskers and that going away bathrobe he shouted i read about you on the bill of fare at the inn they ve run your biography in between the cheese and not responsible for coats and umbrellas what d you do it for hamp and ten years too geewhilikins you re just the same said the hermit come in and sit down sit on that limestone rock over there it s softer than the granite i can t understand it old man said binkley i can see how you could give up a woman for ten years but not ten years for a woman of course i know why you did it everybody does edith carr she jilted four or five besides you but you were the only one who took to a hole in the ground the others had recourse to whiskey the klondike politics and that similia similibus cure but say hamp edith carr was just about the finest woman in the world high toned and proud and noble and playing her ideals to win at all kinds of odds she certainly was a crackerjack after i renounced the world said the hermit i never heard of her again she married me said binkley the hermit leaned against the wooden walls of his ante cave and wriggled his toes i know how you feel about it said binkley what else could she do there were her four sisters and her mother and old man carr you remember how he put all the money he had into dirigible balloons well everything was coming down and nothing going up with em as you might say well i know edith as well as you do although i married her i was worth a million then but i ve run it up since to between five and six it wasn t me she wanted as much as well it was about like this she had that bunch on her hands and they had to be taken care of edith married me two months after you did the ground squirrel act i thought she liked me too at the time and now inquired the recluse we re better friends than ever now she got a divorce from me two years ago just incompatibility i didn t put in any defence well well well hamp this is certainly a funny dugout you ve built here but you always were a hero of fiction seems like you d have been the very one to strike edith s fancy maybe you did but it s the bank roll that catches em my boy your caves and whiskers won t do it honestly hamp don t you think you ve been a darned fool the hermit smiled behind his tangled beard he was and always had been so superior to the crude and mercenary binkley that even his vulgarities could not anger him moreover his studies and meditations in his retreat had raised him far above the little vanities of the world his little mountain side had been almost an olympus over the edge of which he saw smiling the bolts hurled in the valleys of man below had his ten years of renunciation of thought of devotion to an ideal of living scorn of a sordid world been in vain up from the world had come to him the youngest and beautifulest fairer than edith one and three seventh times lovelier than the seven years served rachel so the hermit smiled in his beard when binkley had relieved the hermitage from the blot of his presence and the first faint star showed above the pines the hermit got the can of baking powder from his cupboard he still smiled behind his beard there was a slight rustle in the doorway there stood edith carr with all the added beauty and stateliness and noble bearing that ten years had brought her she was never one to chatter she looked at the hermit with her large thinking dark eyes the hermit stood still surprised into a pose as motionless as her own only his subconscious sense of the fitness of things caused him to turn the baking powder can slowly in his hands until its red label was hidden against his bosom i am stopping at the inn said edith in low but clear tones i heard of you there i told myself that i must see you i want to ask your forgiveness i sold my happiness for money there were others to be provided for but that does not excuse me i just wanted to see you and ask your forgiveness you have lived here ten years they tell me cherishing my memory i was blind hampton i could not see then that all the money in the world cannot weigh in the scales against a faithful heart if but it is too late now of course her assertion was a question clothed as best it could be in a loving woman s pride but through the thin disguise the hermit saw easily that his lady had come back to him if he chose he had won a golden crown if it pleased him to take it the reward of his decade of faithfulness was ready for his hand if he desired to stretch it forth for the space of one minute the old enchantment shone upon him with a reflected radiance and then by turns he felt the manly sensations of indignation at having been discarded and of repugnance at having been as it were sought again and last of all how strange that it should have come at last the pale blue vision of the beautifulest of the trenholme sisters illuminated his mind s eye and left him without a waver it is too late he said in deep tones pressing the baking powder can against his heart once she turned after she had gone slowly twenty yards down the path the hermit had begun to twist the lid off his can but he hid it again under his sacking robe he could see her great eyes shining sadly through the twilight but he stood inflexible in the doorway of his shack and made no sign just as the moon rose on thursday evening the hermit was seized by the world madness up from the inn fainter than the horns of elf land came now and then a few bars of music played by the casino band the hudson was broadened by the night into an illimitable sea those lights dimly seen on its opposite shore were not beacons for prosaic trolley lines but low set stars millions of miles away the waters in front of the inn were gay with fireflies or were they motor boats smelling of gasoline and oil once the hermit had known these things and had sported with amaryllis in the shade of the red and white striped awnings but for ten years he had turned a heedless ear to these far off echoes of a frivolous world but to night there was something wrong the casino band was playing a waltz a waltz what a fool he had been to tear deliberately ten years of his life from the calendar of existence for one who had given him up for the false joys that wealth tum ti tum ti tum ti how did that waltz go but those years had not been sacrificed had they not brought him the star and pearl of all the world the youngest and beautifulest of but do not come on thursday evening she had insisted perhaps by now she would be moving slowly and gracefully to the strains of that waltz held closely by west pointers or city commuters while he who had read in her eyes things that had recompensed him for ten lost years of life moped like some wild animal in its mountain den why should damn it said the hermit suddenly i ll do it he threw down his marcus aurelius and threw off his gunny sack toga he dragged a dust covered trunk from a corner of the cave and with difficulty wrenched open its lid candles he had in plenty and the cave was soon aglow clothes ten years old in cut scissors razors hats shoes all his discarded attire and belongings were dragged ruthlessly from their renunciatory rest and strewn about in painful disorder a pair of scissors soon reduced his beard sufficiently for the dulled razors to perform approximately their office cutting his own hair was beyond the hermit s skill so he only combed and brushed it backward as smoothly as he could charity forbids us to consider the heartburnings and exertions of one so long removed from haberdashery and society at the last the hermit went to an inner corner of his cave and began to dig in the soft earth with a long iron spoon out of the cavity he thus made he drew a tin can and out of the can three thousand dollars in bills tightly rolled and wrapped in oiled silk he was a real hermit as this may assure you you may take a brief look at him as he hastens down the little mountain side a long wrinkled black frock coat reached to his calves white duck trousers unacquainted with the tailor s goose a pink shirt white standing collar with brilliant blue butterfly tie and buttoned congress gaiters but think sir and madam ten years from beneath a narrow brimmed straw hat with a striped band flowed his hair seeing him with all your shrewdness you could not have guessed him you would have said that he played hamlet or the tuba or pinochle you would never have laid your hand on your heart and said he is a hermit who lived ten years in a cave for love of one lady to win another the dancing pavilion extended above the waters of the river gay lanterns and frosted electric globes shed a soft glamour within it a hundred ladies and gentlemen from the inn and summer cottages flitted in and about it to the left of the dusty roadway down which the hermit had tramped were the inn and grill room something seemed to be on there too the windows were brilliantly lighted and music was playing music different from the two steps and waltzes of the casino band a negro man wearing a white jacket came through the iron gate with its immense granite posts and wrought iron lamp holders what is going on here to night asked the hermit well sah said the servitor dey is having de reg lar thursday evenin dance in de casino and in de grill room dere s a beefsteak dinner sah the hermit glanced up at the inn on the hillside whence burst suddenly a triumphant strain of splendid harmony and up there said he they are playing mendelssohn what is going on up there up in de inn said the dusky one dey is a weddin goin on mr binkley a mighty rich man am marryin miss trenholme sah de young lady who am quite de belle of de place sah he also serves if i could have a thousand years just one little thousand years more of life i might in that time draw near enough to true romance to touch the hem of her robe up from ships men come and from waste places and forest and road and garret and cellar to maunder to me in strangely distributed words of the things they have seen and considered the recording of their tales is no more than a matter of ears and fingers there are only two fates i dread deafness and writer s cramp the hand is yet steady let the ear bear the blame if these printed words be not in the order they were delivered to me by hunky magee true camp follower of fortune biography shall claim you but an instant i first knew hunky when he was head waiter at chubb s little beefsteak restaurant and cafe on third avenue there was only one waiter besides then successively i caromed against him in the little streets of the big city after his trip to alaska his voyage as cook with a treasure seeking expedition to the caribbean and his failure as a pearl fisher in the arkansas river between these dashes into the land of adventure he usually came back to chubb s for a while chubb s was a port for him when gales blew too high but when you dined there and hunky went for your steak you never knew whether he would come to anchor in the kitchen or in the malayan archipelago you wouldn t care for his description he was soft of voice and hard of face and rarely had to use more than one eye to quell any approach to a disturbance among chubb s customers one night i found hunky standing at a corner of twenty third street and third avenue after an absence of several months in ten minutes we had a little round table between us in a quiet corner and my ears began to get busy i leave out my sly ruses and feints to draw hunky s word of mouth blows it all came to something like this speaking of the next election said hunky did you ever know much about indians no i don t mean the cooper beadle cigar store or laughing water kind i mean the modern indian the kind that takes greek prizes in colleges and scalps the half back on the other side in football games the kind that eats macaroons and tea in the afternoons with the daughter of the professor of biology and fills up on grasshoppers and fried rattlesnake when they get back to the ancestral wickiup well they ain t so bad i like em better than most foreigners that have come over in the last few hundred years one thing about the indian is this when he mixes with the white race he swaps all his own vices for them of the pale faces and he retains all his own virtues well his virtues are enough to call out the reserves whenever he lets em loose but the imported foreigners adopt our virtues and keep their own vices and it s going to take our whole standing army some day to police that gang but let me tell you about the trip i took to mexico with high jack snakefeeder a cherokee twice removed a graduate of a pennsylvania college and the latest thing in pointed toed rubber heeled patent kid moccasins and madras hunting shirt with turned back cuffs he was a friend of mine i met him in tahlequah when i was out there during the land boom and we got thick he had got all there was out of colleges and had come back to lead his people out of egypt he was a man of first class style and wrote essays and had been invited to visit rich guys houses in boston and such places there was a cherokee girl in muscogee that high jack was foolish about he took me to see her a few times her name was florence blue feather but you want to clear your mind of all ideas of squaws with nose rings and army blankets this young lady was whiter than you are and better educated than i ever was you couldn t have told her from any of the girls shopping in the swell third avenue stores i liked her so well that i got to calling on her now and then when high jack wasn t along which is the way of friends in such matters she was educated at the muscogee college and was making a specialty of let s see eth yes ethnology that s the art that goes back and traces the descent of different races of people leading up from jelly fish through monkeys and to the o briens high jack had took up that line too and had read papers about it before all kinds of riotous assemblies chautauquas and choctaws and chowder parties and such having a mutual taste for musty information like that was what made em like each other i suppose but i don t know what they call congeniality of tastes ain t always it now when miss blue feather and me was talking together i listened to her affidavits about the first families of the land of nod being cousins german well if the germans don t nod who does to the mound builders of ohio with incomprehension and respect and when i d tell her about the bowery and coney island and sing her a few songs that i d heard the jamaica niggers sing at their church lawn parties she didn t look much less interested than she did when high jack would tell her that he had a pipe that the first inhabitants of america originally arrived here on stilts after a freshet at tenafly new jersey but i was going to tell you more about high jack about six months ago i get a letter from him saying he d been commissioned by the minority report bureau of ethnology at washington to go down to mexico and translate some excavations or dig up the meaning of some shorthand notes on some ruins or something of that sort and if i d go along he could squeeze the price into the expense account well i d been holding a napkin over my arm at chubb s about long enough then so i wired high jack yes and he sent me a ticket and i met him in washington and he had a lot of news to tell me first of all was that florence blue feather had suddenly disappeared from her home and environments run away i asked vanished says high jack disappeared like your shadow when the sun goes under a cloud she was seen on the street and then she turned a corner and nobody ever seen her afterward the whole community turned out to look for her but we never found a clew that s bad that s bad says i she was a mighty nice girl and as smart as you find em high jack seemed to take it hard i guess he must have esteemed miss blue feather quite highly i could see that he d referred the matter to the whiskey jug that was his weak point and many another man s i ve noticed that when a man loses a girl he generally takes to drink either just before or just after it happens from washington we railroaded it to new orleans and there took a tramp steamer bound for belize and a gale pounded us all down the caribbean and nearly wrecked us on the yucatan coast opposite a little town without a harbor called boca de coacoyula suppose the ship had run against that name in the dark better fifty years of europe than a cyclone in the bay says high jack snakefeeder so we get the captain to send us ashore in a dory when the squall seemed to cease from squalling we will find ruins here or make em says high the government doesn t care which we do an appropriation is an appropriation boca de coacoyula was a dead town them biblical towns we read about tired and siphon after they was destroyed they must have looked like forty second street and broadway compared to this boca place it still claimed inhabitants as estimated and engraved on the stone court house by the census taker in the citizens were a mixture of indians and other indians but some of em was light colored which i was surprised to see the town was huddled up on the shore with woods so thick around it that a subpoena server couldn t have reached a monkey ten yards away with the papers we wondered what kept it from being annexed to kansas but we soon found out that it was major bing major bing was the ointment around the fly he had the cochineal sarsaparilla log wood annatto hemp and all other dye woods and pure food adulteration concessions cornered he had five sixths of the boca de thingama jiggers working for him on shares it was a beautiful graft we used to brag about morgan and e h and others of our wisest when i was in the provinces but now no more that peninsula has got our little country turned into a submarine without even the observation tower showing major bing s idea was this he had the population go forth into the forest and gather these products when they brought em in he gave em one fifth for their trouble sometimes they d strike and demand a sixth the major always gave in to em the major had a bungalow so close on the sea that the nine inch tide seeped through the cracks in the kitchen floor me and him and high jack snakefeeder sat on the porch and drank rum from noon till midnight he said he had piled up in new orleans banks and high and me could stay with him forever if we would but high jack happened to think of the united states and began to talk ethnology ruins says major bing the woods are full of em i don t know how far they date back but they was here before i came high jack asks what form of worship the citizens of that locality are addicted to why says the major rubbing his nose i can t hardly say i imagine it s infidel or aztec or nonconformist or something like that there s a church here a methodist or some other kind with a parson named skidder he claims to have converted the people to christianity he and me don t assimilate except on state occasions i imagine they worship some kind of gods or idols yet but skidder says he has em in the fold a few days later high jack and me prowling around strikes a plain path into the forest and follows it a good four miles then a branch turns to the left we go a mile maybe down that and run up against the finest ruin you ever saw solid stone with trees and vines and under brush all growing up against it and in it and through it all over it was chiselled carvings of funny beasts and people that would have been arrested if they d ever come out in vaudeville that way we approached it from the rear high jack had been drinking too much rum ever since we landed in boca you know how an indian is the palefaces fixed his clock when they introduced him to firewater he d brought a quart along with him hunky says he we ll explore the ancient temple it may be that the storin that landed us here was propitious the minority report bureau of ethnology says he may yet profit by the vagaries of wind and tide we went in the rear door of the bum edifice we struck a kind of alcove without bath there was a granite davenport and a stone wash stand without any soap or exit for the water and some hardwood pegs drove into holes in the wall and that was all to go out of that furnished apartment into a harlem hall bedroom would make you feel like getting back home from an amateur violoncello solo at an east side settlement house while high was examining some hieroglyphics on the wall that the stone masons must have made when their tools slipped i stepped into the front room that was at least thirty by fifty feet stone floor six little windows like square port holes that didn t let much light in i looked back over my shoulder and sees high jack s face three feet away high says i of all the and then i noticed he looked funny and i turned around he d taken off his clothes to the waist and he didn t seem to hear me i touched him and came near beating it high jack had turned to stone i had been drinking some rum myself ossified i says to him loudly i knew what would happen if you kept it up and then high jack comes in from the alcove when he hears me conversing with nobody and we have a look at mr snakefeeder no it s a stone idol or god or revised statute or something and it looks as much like high jack as one green pea looks like itself it s got exactly his face and size and color but it s steadier on its pins it stands on a kind of rostrum or pedestal and you can see it s been there ten million years he s a cousin of mine sings high and then he turns solemn hunky he says putting one hand on my shoulder and one on the statue s i m in the holy temple of my ancestors well if looks goes for anything says i you ve struck a twin stand side by side with buddy and let s see if there s any diff erence there wasn t you know an indian can keep his face as still as an iron dog s when he wants to so when high jack froze his features you couldn t have told him from the other one there s some letters says i on his nob s pedestal but i can t make em out the alphabet of this country seems to be composed of sometimes a e i o and u but generally z s l s and t s high jack s ethnology gets the upper hand of his rum for a minute and he investigates the inscription hunky says he this is a statue of tlotopaxl one of the most powerful gods of the ancient aztecs glad to know him says i but in his present condition he reminds me of the joke shakespeare got off on julius caesar we might say about your friend imperious what s his name dead and tunied to stone no use to write or call him on the phone hunky says high jack snakefeeder looking at me funny do you believe in reincarnation it sounds to me says i like either a clean up of the slaughter houses or a new kind of boston pink i don t know i believe says he that i am the reincarnation of tlotopaxl my researches have convinced me that the cherokees of all the north american tribes can boast of the straightest descent from the proud aztec race that says he was a favorite theory of mine and florence blue feather s and she what if she high jack grabs my arm and walls his eyes at me just then he looked more like his eminent co indian murderer crazy horse well says i what if she what if she what if she you re drunk says i impersonating idols and believing in what was it recarnalization let s have a drink says i it s as spooky here as a brooklyn artificial limb factory at midnight with the gas turned down just then i heard somebody coming and i dragged high jack into the bedless bedchamber there was peep holes bored through the wall so we could see the whole front part of the temple major bing told me afterward that the ancient priests in charge used to rubber through them at the congregation in a few minutes an old indian woman came in with a big oval earthen dish full of grub she set it on a square block of stone in front of the graven image and laid down and walloped her face on the floor a few times and then took a walk for herself high jack and me was hungry so we came out and looked it over there was goat steaks and fried rice cakes and plantains and cassava and broiled land crabs and mangoes nothing like what you get at chubb s we ate hearty and had another round of rum it must be old tecumseh s or whatever you call him birthday says i or do they feed him every day i thought gods only drank vanilla on mount catawampus then some more native parties in short kimonos that showed their aboriginees punctured the near horizon and me and high had to skip back into father axletree s private boudoir they came by ones twos and threes and left all sorts of offerings there was enough grub for bingham s nine gods of war with plenty left over for the peace conference at the hague they brought jars of honey and bunches of bananas and bottles of wine and stacks of tortillas and beautiful shawls worth one hundred dollars apiece that the indian women weave of a kind of vegetable fibre like silk all of em got down and wriggled on the floor in front of that hard finish god and then sneaked off through the woods again i wonder who gets this rake off remarks high jack oh says i there s priests or deputy idols or a committee of disarrangements somewhere in the woods on the job wherever you find a god you ll find somebody waiting to take charge of the burnt offerings and then we took another swig of rum and walked out to the parlor front door to cool off for it was as hot inside as a summer camp on the palisades and while we stood there in the breeze we looks down the path and sees a young lady approaching the blasted ruin she was bare footed and had on a white robe and carried a wreath of white flowers in her hand when she got nearer we saw she had a long blue feather stuck through her black hair and when she got nearer still me and high jack snakefeeder grabbed each other to keep from tumbling down on the floor for the girl s face was as much like florence blue feather s as his was like old king toxicology s and then was when high jack s booze drowned his system of ethnology he dragged me inside back of the statue and says lay hold of it hunky we ll pack it into the other room i felt it all the time says he i m the reconsideration of the god locomotorataxia and florence blue feather was my bride a thousand years ago she has come to seek me in the temple where i used to reign all right says i there s no use arguing against the rum question you take his feet we lifted the three hundred pound stone god and carried him into the back room of the cafe the temple i mean and leaned him against the wall it was more work than bouncing three live ones from an all night broadway joint on new year s eve then high jack ran out and brought in a couple of them indian silk shawls and began to undress himself oh figs says i is it thus strong drink is an adder and subtractor too is it the heat or the call of the wild that s got you but high jack is too full of exaltation and cane juice to reply he stops the disrobing business just short of the manhattan beach rules and then winds them red and white shawls around him and goes out and stands on the pedestal as steady as any platinum deity you ever saw and i looks through a peek hole to see what he is up to in a few minutes in comes the girl with the flower wreath danged if i wasn t knocked a little silly when she got close she looked so exactly much like florence blue feather i wonder says i to myself if she has been reincarcerated too if i could see says i to myself whether she has a mole on her left but the next minute i thought she looked one eighth of a shade darker than florence but she looked good at that and high jack hadn t drunk all the rum that had been drank the girl went up within ten feet of the bum idol and got down and massaged her nose with the floor like the rest did then she went nearer and laid the flower wreath on the block of stone at high jack s feet rummy as i was i thought it was kind of nice of her to think of offering flowers instead of household and kitchen provisions even a stone god ought to appreciate a little sentiment like that on top of the fancy groceries they had piled up in front of him and then high jack steps down from his pedestal quiet and mentions a few words that sounded just like the hieroglyphics carved on the walls of the ruin the girl gives a little jump backward and her eyes fly open as big as doughnuts but she don t beat it why didn t she i ll tell you why i think why it don t seem to a girl so supernatural unlikely strange and startling that a stone god should come to life for her if he was to do it for one of them snub nosed brown girls on the other side of the woods now it would be different but her i ll bet she said to herself well goodness me you ve been a long time getting on your job i ve half a mind not to speak to you but she and high jack holds hands and walks away out of the temple together by the

that either might or should at a later time cap the ceremony lorison tendered a fee which was declined and before the door closed after the departing couple father rogan s book popped open again where his finger marked it in the dark hall norah whirled and clung to her com panion tearful will you never never be sorry at last she was reassured at the first light they reached upon the street she asked the time just as she had each night lorison looked at his watch half past eight lorison thought it was from habit that she guided their steps toward the corner where they always parted but arrived there she hesitated and then released his arm a drug store stood on the corner its bright soft light shone upon them please leave me here as usual to night said norah sweetly i must i would rather you would you will not object at six to morrow evening i will meet you at antonio s i want to sit with vou there once more and then i will go where you say she gave him a bewildering bright smile and walked swiftly away surely it needed all the strength of her charm to carry off this astounding behaviour it was no discredit to lorison s strength of mind that his head began to whirl pocketing his hands he rambled vacuously over to the druggist s windows and began assiduously to spell over the names of the patent medicines therein displayed as soon as be had recovered his wits he proceeded along the street in an aimless fashion after drifting for two or three squares he flowed into a somewhat more pretentious thoroughfare a way much frequented by him in his solitary ramblings for here was a row of slops devoted to traffic in goods of the widest range of choice handiworks of art skill and fancy products of nature and labour from every zone here for a time he loitered among

long time he had touched his fellow man only at the gear of a levelled cog wheel at right angles and upon a different axis he had dropped into a distinctly new orbit the stroke of ill fortune had

of the woman the parade halted before the window by which lorison stood he saw that she was young and at the first glance was deceived by a sophistical prettiness of her face which waned before a more judicious scrutiny her look was bold and reckless and upon her countenance where yet the contours of youth survived were the finger marks of old age s credentialed courier late hours the young woman fixed her unshrinking gaze upon lorison and called to him in the voice of the wronged heroine in straits say you look like a good fellow come and put up the bail won t you i ve done nothing to get

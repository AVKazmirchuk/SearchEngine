of my life to get the recipe for making them pancakes that s what i went to see miss learight for says jackson bird but i haven t been able to get it from her it s an old recipe that s been in the family for seventy five years they hand it down from one generation to another but they don t give it away to outsiders if i could get that recipe so i could make them pancakes for myself on my ranch i d be a happy man says bird are you sure i says to him that it ain t the hand that mixes the pancakes that you re after sure says jackson miss learight is a mighty nice girl but i can assure you my intentions go no further than the gastro but he seen my hand going down to my holster and he changed his similitude than the desire to procure a copy of the pancake recipe he finishes you ain t such a bad little man says i trying to be fair i was thinking some of making orphans of your sheep but i ll let you fly away this time but you stick to pancakes says i as close as the middle one of a stack and don t go and mistake sentiments for syrup or there ll be singing at your ranch and you won t hear it to convince you that i am sincere says the sheep man i ll ask you to help me miss learight and you being closer friends maybe she would do for you what she wouldn t for me if you will get me a copy of that pancake recipe i give you my word that i ll never call upon her again that s fair i says and i shook hands with jackson bird i ll get it for you if i can and glad to oblige and he turned off down the big pear flat on the piedra in the direction of mired mule and i steered northwest for old bill toomey s ranch it was five days afterward when i got another chance to ride over to pimienta miss willella and me passed a gratifying evening at uncle emsley s she sang some and exasperated the piano quite a lot with quotations from the operas i gave imitations of a rattlesnake and told her about snaky mcfee s new way of skinning cows and described the trip i made to saint louis once we was getting along in one another s estimations fine thinks i if jackson bird can now be persuaded to migrate i win i recollect his promise about the pancake receipt and i thinks i will persuade it from miss willella and give it to him and then if i catches birdie off of mired mule again i ll make him hop the twig so along about ten o clock i put on a wheedling smile and says to miss willella now if there s anything i do like better than the sight of a red steer on green grass it s the taste of a nice hot pancake smothered in sugar house molasses miss willella gives a little jump on the piano stool and looked at me curious yes says she they re real nice what did you say was the name of that street in saint louis mr odom where you lost your hat pancake avenue says i with a wink to show her that i was on about the family receipt and couldn t be side corralled off of the subject come now miss willella i says let s hear how you make em pancakes is just whirling in my head like wagon wheels start her off now pound of flour eight dozen eggs and so on how does the catalogue of constituents run excuse me for a moment please says miss willella and she gives me a quick kind of sideways look and slides off the stool she ambled out into the other room and directly uncle emsley comes in in his shirt sleeves with a pitcher of water he turns around to get a glass on the table and i see a forty five in his hip pocket great post holes thinks i but here s a family thinks a heap of cooking receipts protecting it with firearms i ve known outfits that wouldn t do that much by a family feud drink this here down says uncle emsley handing me the glass of water you ve rid too far to day jud and got yourself over excited try to think about something else now do you know how to make them pancakes uncle emsley i asked well i m not as apprised in the anatomy of them as some says uncle emsley but i reckon you take a sifter of plaster of paris and a little dough and saleratus and corn meal and mix em with eggs and buttermilk as usual is old bill going to ship beeves to kansas city again this spring jud that was all the pancake specifications i could get that night i didn t wonder that jackson bird found it uphill work so i dropped the subject and talked with uncle emsley for a while about hollow horn and cyclones and then miss willella came and said good night and i hit the breeze for the ranch about a week afterward i met jackson bird riding out of pimienta as i rode in and we stopped on the road for a few frivolous remarks got the bill of particulars for them flapjacks yet i asked him well no says jackson i don t seem to have any success in getting hold of it did you try i did says i and twas like trying to dig a prairie dog out of his hole with a peanut hull that pancake receipt must be a jookalorum the way they hold on to it i m most ready to give it up says jackson so discouraged in his pronunciations that i felt sorry for him but i did want to know how to make them pancakes to eat on my lonely ranch says he i lie awake at nights thinking how good they are you keep on trying for it i tells him and i ll do the same one of us is bound to get a rope over its horns before long well so long jacksy you see by this time we were on the peacefullest of terms when i saw that he wasn t after miss willella i had more endurable contemplations of that sandy haired snoozer in order to help out the ambitions of his appetite i kept on trying to get that receipt from miss willella but every time i would say pancakes she would get sort of remote and fidgety about the eye and try to change the subject if i held her to it she would slide out and round up uncle emsley with his pitcher of water and hip pocket howitzer one day i galloped over to the store with a fine bunch of blue verbenas that i cut out of a herd of wild flowers over on poisoned dog prairie uncle emsley looked at em with one eye shut and says haven t ye heard the news cattle up i asks willella and jackson bird was married in palestine yesterday says he just got a letter this morning i dropped them flowers in a cracker barrel and let the news trickle in my ears and down toward my upper left hand shirt pocket until it got to my feet would you mind saying that over again once more uncle emsley says i maybe my hearing has got wrong and you only said that prime heifers was on the hoof or something like that married yesterday says uncle emsley and gone to waco and niagara falls on a wedding tour why didn t you see none of the signs all along jackson bird has been courting willella ever since that day he took her out riding then says i in a kind of yell what was all this zizzaparoola he gives me about pancakes tell me that when i said pancakes uncle emsley sort of dodged and stepped back somebody s been dealing me pancakes from the bottom of the deck i says and i ll find out i believe you know talk up says i or we ll mix a panful of batter right here i slid over the counter after uncle emsley he grabbed at his gun but it was in a drawer and he missed it two inches i got him by the front of his shirt and shoved him in a corner talk pancakes says i or be made into one does miss willella make em she never made one in her life and i never saw one says uncle emsley soothing calm down now jud calm down you ve got excited and that wound in your head is contaminating your sense of intelligence try not to think about pancakes uncle emsley says i i m not wounded in the head except so far as my natural cognitive instincts run to runts jackson bird told me he was calling on miss willella for the purpose of finding out her system of producing pancakes and he asked me to help him get the bill of lading of the ingredients i done so with the results as you see have i been sodded down with johnson grass by a pink eyed snoozer or what slack up your grip in my dress shirt says uncle emsley and i ll tell you yes it looks like jackson bird has gone and humbugged you some the day after he went riding with willella he came back and told me and her to watch out for you whenever you got to talking about pancakes he said you was in camp once where they was cooking flapjacks and one of the fellows cut you over the head with a frying pan jackson said that whenever you got overhot or excited that wound hurt you and made you kind of crazy and you went raving about pancakes he told us to just get you worked off of the subject and soothed down and you wouldn t be dangerous so me and willella done the best by you we knew how well well says uncle emsley that jackson bird is sure a seldom kind of a snoozer during the progress of jud s story he had been slowly but deftly combining certain portions of the contents of his sacks and cans toward the close of it he set before me the finished product a pair of red hot rich hued pancakes on a tin plate from some secret hoarding he also brought a lump of excellent butter and a bottle of golden syrup how long ago did these things happen i asked him three years said jud they re living on the mired mule ranch now but i haven t seen either of em since they say jackson bird was fixing his ranch up fine with rocking chairs and window curtains all the time he was putting me up the pancake tree oh i got over it after a while but the boys kept the racket up did you make these cakes by the famous recipe i asked didn t i tell you there wasn t no receipt said jud the boys hollered pancakes till they got pancake hungry and i cut this recipe out of a newspaper how does the truck taste they re delicious i answered why don t you have some too jud i was sure i heard a sigh me said jud i don t ever eat em seats of the haughty golden by day and silver by night a new trail now leads to us across the indian ocean dusky kings and princes have found our bombay of the west and few be their trails that do not lead down to broadway on their journey for to admire and for to see if chance should ever lead you near a hotel that transiently shelters some one of these splendid touring grandees i counsel you to seek lucullus polk among the republican tuft hunters that besiege its entrances he will be there you will know him by his red alert wellington nosed face by his manner of nervous caution mingled with determination by his assumed promoter s or broker s air of busy impatience and by his bright red necktie gallantly redressing the wrongs of his maltreated blue serge suit like a battle standard still waving above a lost cause i found him profitable and so may you when you do look for him look among the light horse troop of bedouins that besiege the picket line of the travelling potentate s guards and secretaries among the wild eyed genii of arabian afternoons that gather to make astounding and egregrious demands upon the prince s coffers i first saw mr polk coming down the steps of the hotel at which sojourned his highness the gaekwar of baroda most enlightened of the mahratta princes who of late ate bread and salt in our metropolis of the occident lucullus moved rapidly as though propelled by some potent moral force that imminently threatened to become physical behind him closely followed the impetus a hotel detective if ever white alpine hat hawk s nose implacable watch chain and loud refinement of manner spoke the truth a brace of uniformed porters at his heels preserved the smooth decorum of the hotel repudiating by their air of disengagement any suspicion that they formed a reserve squad of ejectment safe on the sidewalk lucullus polk turned and shook a freckled fist at the caravansary and to my joy he began to breathe deep invective in strange words rides in howdays does he he cried loudly and sneeringly rides on elephants in howdahs and calls himself a prince kings yah comes over here and talks horse till you would think he was a president and then goes home and rides in a private dining room strapped onto an elephant well well well the ejecting committee quietly retired the scorner of princes turned to me and snapped his fingers what do you think of that he shouted derisively the gaekwar of baroda rides in an elephant in a howdah and there s old bikram shamsher jang scorching up and down the pig paths of khatmandu on a motor cycle wouldn t that maharajah you and the shah of persia that ought to have been muley on the spot for at least three he s got the palanquin habit and that funny hat prince from korea wouldn t you think he could afford to amble around on a milk white palfrey once in a dynasty or two nothing doing his idea of a balaklava charge is to tuck his skirts under him and do his mile in six days over the hog wallows of seoul in a bull cart that s the kind of visiting potentates that come to this country now it s a hard deal friend i murmured a few words of sympathy but it was uncomprehending for i did not know his grievance against the rulers who flash meteor like now and then upon our shores the last one i sold continued the displeased one was to that three horse tailed turkish pasha that came over a year ago five hundred dollars he paid for it easy i says to his executioner or secretary he was a kind of a jew or a chinaman his turkey gibbets is fond of horses then him says the secretary well no he s got a big fat wife in the harem named bad dora that he don t like i believe he intends to saddle her up and ride her up and down the board walk in the bulbul gardens a few times every day you haven t got a pair of extra long spurs you could throw in on the deal have you yes sir there s mighty few real rough riders among the royal sports these days as soon as lucullus polk got cool enough i picked him up and with no greater effort than you would employ in persuading a drowning man to clutch a straw i inveigled him into accompanying me to a cool corner in a dim cafe and it came to pass that man servants set before us brewage and lucullus polk spake unto me relating the wherefores of his beleaguering the antechambers of the princes of the earth did you ever hear of the s a a p railroad in texas well that don t stand for samaritan actor s aid philanthropy i was down that way managing a summer bunch of the gum and syntax chewers that play the idlewild parks in the western hamlets of course we went to pieces when the soubrette ran away with a prominent barber of beeville i don t know what became of the rest of the company i believe there were some salaries due and the last i saw of the troupe was when i told them that forty three cents was all the treasury contained i say i never saw any of them after that but i heard them for about twenty minutes i didn t have time to look back but after dark i came out of the woods and struck the s a a p agent for means of transportation he at once extended to me the courtesies of the entire railroad kindly warning me however not to get aboard any of the rolling stock about ten the next morning i steps off the ties into a village that calls itself atascosa city i bought a thirty cent breakfast and a ten cent cigar and stood on the main street jingling the three pennies in my pocket dead broke a man in texas with only three cents in his pocket is no better off than a man that has no money and owes two cents one of luck s favourite tricks is to soak a man for his last dollar so quick that he don t have time to look it there i was in a swell st louis tailor made blue and green plaid suit and an eighteen carat sulphate of copper scarf pin with no hope in sight except the two great texas industries the cotton fields and grading new railroads i never picked cotton and i never cottoned to a pick so the outlook had ultramarine edges all of a sudden while i was standing on the edge of the wooden sidewalk down out of the sky falls two fine gold watches in the middle of the street one hits a chunk of mud and sticks the other falls hard and flies open making a fine drizzle of little springs and screws and wheels i looks up for a balloon or an airship but not seeing any i steps off the sidewalk to investigate but i hear a couple of yells and see two men running up the street in leather overalls and high heeled boots and cartwheel hats one man is six or eight feet high with open plumbed joints and a heartbroken cast of countenance he picks up the watch that has stuck in the mud the other man who is little with pink hair and white eyes goes for the empty case and says i win then the elevated pessimist goes down under his leather leg holsters and hands a handful of twenty dollar gold pieces to his albino friend i don t know how much money it was it looked as big as an earthquake relief fund to me i ll have this here case filled up with works says shorty and throw you again for five hundred i m your company says the high man i ll meet you at the smoked dog saloon an hour from now the little man hustles away with a kind of swiss movement toward a jewelry store the heartbroken person stoops over and takes a telescopic view of my haberdashery them s a mighty slick outfit of habiliments you have got on mr man says he i ll bet a hoss you never acquired the right title and interest in and to them clothes in atascosa city why no says i being ready enough to exchange personalities with this moneyed monument of melancholy i had this suit tailored from a special line of coatericks vestures and pantings in st louis would you mind putting me sane says i on this watch throwing contest i ve been used to seeing time pieces treated with more politeness and esteem except women s watches of course which by nature they abuse by cracking walnuts with em and having em taken showing in tintype pictures me and george he explains are up from the ranch having a spell of fun up to last month we owned four sections of watered grazing down on the san miguel but along comes one of these oil prospectors and begins to bore he strikes a gusher that flows out twenty thousand or maybe it was twenty million barrels of oil a day and me and george gets one hundred and fifty thousand dollars seventy five thousand dollars apiece for the land so now and then we saddles up and hits the breeze for atascosa city for a few days of excitement and damage here s a little bunch of the dinero that i drawed out of the bank this morning says he and shows a roll of twenties and fifties as big around as a sleeping car pillow the yellowbacks glowed like a sunset on the gable end of john d s barn my knees got weak and i sat down on the edge of the board sidewalk you must have knocked around a right smart goes on this oil grease us i shouldn t be surprised if you have saw towns more livelier than what atascosa city is sometimes it seems to me that there ought to be some more ways of having a good time than there is here specially when you ve got plenty of money and don t mind spending it then this mother cary s chick of the desert sits down by me and we hold a conversationfest it seems that he was money poor he d lived in ranch camps all his life and he confessed to me that his supreme idea of luxury was to ride into camp tired out from a round up eat a peck of mexican beans hobble his brains with a pint of raw whisky and go to sleep with his boots for a pillow when this barge load of unexpected money came to him and his pink but perky partner george and they hied themselves to this clump of outhouses called atascosa city you know what happened to them they had money to buy anything they wanted but they didn t know what to want their ideas of spendthriftiness were limited to three whisky saddles and gold watches if there was anything else in the world to throw away fortunes on they had never heard about it so when they wanted to have a hot time they d ride into town and get a city directory and stand in front of the principal saloon and call up the population alphabetically for free drinks then they would order three or four new california saddles from the storekeeper and play crack loo on the sidewalk with twenty dollar gold pieces betting who could throw his gold watch the farthest was an inspiration of george s but even that was getting to be monotonous was i on to the opportunity listen in thirty minutes i had dashed off a word picture of metropolitan joys that made life in atascosa city look as dull as a trip to coney island with your own wife in ten minutes more we shook hands on an agreement that i was to act as his guide interpreter and friend in and to the aforesaid wassail and amenity and solomon mills which was his name was to pay all expenses for a month at the end of that time if i had made good as director general of the rowdy life he was to pay me one thousand dollars and then to clinch the bargain we called the roll of atascosa city and put all of its citizens except the ladies and minors under the table except one man named horace westervelt st clair just for that we bought a couple of hatfuls of cheap silver watches and egged him out of town with em we wound up by dragging the harness maker out of bed and setting him to work on three new saddles and then we went to sleep across the railroad track at the depot just to annoy the s a a p think of having seventy five thousand dollars and trying to avoid the disgrace of dying rich in a town like that the next day george who was married or something started back to the ranch me and solly as i now called him prepared to shake off our moth balls and wing our way against the arc lights of the joyous and tuneful east no way stops says i to solly except long enough to get you barbered and haberdashed this is no texas feet shampetter says i where you eat chili concarne con huevos and then holler whoopee across the plaza we re now going against the real high life we re going to mingle with the set that carries a spitz wears spats and hits the ground in high spots solly puts six thousand dollars in century bills in one pocket of his brown ducks and bills of lading for ten thousand dollars on eastern banks in another then i resume diplomatic relations with the s a a p and we hike in a northwesterly direction on our circuitous route to the spice gardens of the yankee orient we stopped in san antonio long enough for solly to buy some clothes and eight rounds of drinks for the guests and employees of the menger hotel and order four mexican saddles with silver trimmings and white angora suaderos to be shipped down to the ranch from there we made a big jump to st louis we got there in time for dinner and i put our thumb prints on the register of the most expensive hotel in the city now says i to solly with a wink at myself here s the first dinner station we ve struck where we can get a real good plate of beans and while he was up in his room trying to draw water out of the gas pipe i got one finger in the buttonhole of the head waiter s tuxedo drew him apart inserted a two dollar bill and closed him up again frankoyse says i i have a pal here for dinner that s been subsisting for years on cereals and short stogies you see the chef and order a dinner for us such as you serve to dave francis and the general passenger agent of the iron mountain when they eat here we ve got more than bernhardt s tent full of money and we want the nose bags crammed with all the chief deveries de cuisine object is no expense now show us at six o clock me and solly sat down to dinner spread there s nothing been seen like it since the cambon snack it was all served at once the chef called it dinnay a la poker it s a famous thing among the gormands of the west the dinner comes in threes of a kind there was guinea fowls guinea pigs and guinness s stout roast veal mock turtle soup and chicken pate shad roe caviar and tapioca canvas back duck canvas back ham and cotton tail rabbit philadelphia capon fried snails and sloe gin and so on in threes the idea was that you eat nearly all you can of them and then the waiter takes away the discard and gives you pears to fill on i was sure solly would be tickled to death with these hands after the bobtail flushes he d been eating on the ranch and i was a little anxious that he should for i didn t remember his having honoured my efforts with a smile since we left atascosa city we were in the main dining room and there was a fine dressed crowd there all talking loud and enjoyable about the two st louis topics the water supply and the colour line they mix the two subjects so fast that strangers often think they are discussing water colours and that has given the old town something of a rep as an art centre and over in the corner was a fine brass band playing and now thinks i solly will become conscious of the spiritual oats of life nourishing and exhilarating his system but nong mong frang he gazed across the table at me there was four square yards of it looking like the path of a cyclone that has wandered through a stock yard a poultry farm a vegetable garden and an irish linen mill solly gets up and comes around to me luke says he i m pretty hungry after our ride i thought you said they had some beans here i m going out and get something i can eat you can stay and monkey with this artificial layout of grub if you want to wait a minute says i i called the waiter and slapped s mills on the back of the check for thirteen dollars and fifty cents what do you mean says i by serving gentlemen with a lot of truck only suitable for deck hands on a mississippi steamboat we re going out to get something decent to eat i walked up the street with the unhappy plainsman he saw a saddle shop open and some of the sadness faded from his eyes we went in and he ordered and paid for two more saddles one with a solid silver horn and nails and ornaments and a six inch border of rhinestones and imitation rubies around the flaps the other one had to have a gold mounted horn quadruple plated stirrups and the leather inlaid with silver beadwork wherever it would stand it eleven hundred dollars the two cost him then he goes out and heads toward the river following his nose in a little side street where there was no street and no sidewalks and no houses he finds what he is looking for we go into a shanty and sit on high stools among stevedores and boatmen and eat beans with tin spoons yes sir beans beans boiled with salt pork i kind of thought we d strike some over this way says solly delightful says i that stylish hotel grub may appeal to some but for me give me the husky table d goat when we had succumbed to the beans i leads him out of the tarpaulin steam under a lamp post and pulls out a daily paper with the amusement column folded out but now what ho for a merry round of pleasure says i here s one of hall caine s shows and a stock yard company in hamlet and skating at the hollowhorn rink and sarah bernhardt and the shapely syrens burlesque company i should think now that the shapely but what does this healthy wealthy and wise man do but reach his arms up to the second story windows and gape noisily reckon i ll be going to bed says he it s about my time st louis is a kind of quiet place ain t it oh yes says i ever since the railroads ran in here the town s been practically ruined and the building and loan associations and the fair have about killed it guess we might as well go to bed wait till you see chicago though shall we get tickets for the big breeze to morrow mought as well says solly i reckon all these towns are about alike well maybe the wise cicerone and personal conductor didn t fall hard in chicago loolooville on the lake is supposed to have one or two things in it calculated to keep the rural visitor awake after the curfew rings but not for the grass fed man of the pampas i tried him with theatres rides in automobiles sails on the lake champagne suppers and all those little inventions that hold the simple life in check but in vain solly grew sadder day by day and i got fearful about my salary and knew i must play my trump card so i mentioned new york to him and informed him that these western towns were no more than gateways to the great walled city of the whirling dervishes after i bought the tickets i missed solly i knew his habits by then so in a couple of hours i found him in a saddle shop they had some new ideas there in the way of trees and girths that had strayed down from the canadian mounted police and solly was so interested that he almost looked reconciled to live he invested about nine hundred dollars in there at the depot i telegraphed a cigar store man i knew in new york to meet me at the twenty third street ferry with a list of all the saddle stores in the city i wanted to know where to look for solly when he got lost now i ll tell you what happened in new york i says to myself friend heherezade you want to get busy and make bagdad look pretty to the sad sultan of the sour countenance or it ll be the bowstring for yours but i never had any doubt i could do it i began with him like you d feed a starving man i showed him the horse cars on broadway and the staten island ferry boats and then i piled up the sensations on him but always keeping a lot of warmer ones up my sleeve at the end of the third day he looked like a composite picture of five thousand orphans too late to catch a picnic steamboat and i was wilting down a collar every two hours wondering how i could please him and whether i was going to get my thou he went to sleep looking at the brooklyn bridge he disregarded the sky scrapers above the third story it took three ushers to wake him up at the liveliest vaudeville in town once i thought i had him i nailed a pair of cuffs on him one morning before he was awake and i dragged him that evening to the palm cage of one of the biggest hotels in the city to see the johnnies and the alice sit by the hours they were out in numerous quantities with the fat of the land showing in their clothes while we were looking them over solly divested himself of a fearful rusty kind of laugh like moving a folding bed with one roller broken it was his first in two weeks and it gave me hope right you are says i they re a funny lot of post cards aren t they oh i wasn t thinking of them dudes and culls on the hoof says he i was thinking of the time me and george put sheep dip in horsehead johnson s whisky i wish i was back in atascosa city says he i felt a cold chill run down my back me to play and mate in one move says i to myself i made solly promise to stay in the cafe for half an hour and i hiked out in a cab to lolabelle delatour s flat on forty third street i knew her well she was a chorus girl in a broadway musical comedy jane says i when i found her i ve got a friend from texas here he s all right but well he carries weight i d like to give him a little whirl after the show this evening bubbles you know and a buzz out to a casino for the whitebait and pickled walnuts is it a go can he sing asks lolabelle you know says i that i wouldn t take him away from home unless his notes were good he s got pots of money bean pots full of it bring him around after the second act says lolabelle and i ll examine his credentials and securities so about ten o clock that evening i led solly to miss delatour s dressing room and her maid let us in in ten minutes in comes lolabelle fresh from the stage looking stunning in the costume she wears when she steps from the ranks of the lady grenadiers and says to the king welcome to our may day revels and you can bet it wasn t the way she spoke the lines that got her the part as soon as solly saw her he got up and walked straight out through the stage entrance into the street i followed him lolabelle wasn t paying my salary i wondered whether anybody was luke says solly outside that was an awful mistake we must have got into the lady s private room i hope i m gentleman enough to do anything possible in the way of apologies do you reckon she d ever forgive us she may forget it says i of course it was a mistake let s go find some beans that s the way it went but pretty soon afterward solly failed to show up at dinner time for several days i cornered him he confessed that he had found a restaurant on third avenue where they cooked beans in texas style i made him take me there the minute i set foot inside the door i threw up my hands there was a young woman at the desk and solly introduced me to her and then we sat down and had beans yes sir sitting at the desk was the kind of a young woman that can catch any man in the world as easy as lifting a finger there s a way of doing it she knew i saw her working it she was healthy looking and plain dressed she had her hair drawn back from her forehead and face no curls or frizzes that s the way she looked now i ll tell you the way they work the game it s simple when she wants a man she manages it so that every time he looks at her he finds her looking at him that s all the next evening solly was to go to coney island with me at seven at eight o clock he hadn t showed up i went out and found a cab i felt sure there was something wrong drive to the back home restaurant on third avenue says i and if i don t find what i want there take in these saddle shops i handed him the list boss says the cabby i et a steak in that restaurant once if you re real hungry i advise you to try the saddle shops first i m a detective says i and i don t eat hurry up as soon as i got to the restaurant i felt in the lines of my palms that i should beware of a tall red damfool man and i was going to lose a sum of money solly wasn t there neither was the smooth haired lady i waited and in an hour they came in a cab and got out hand in hand i asked solly to step around the corner for a few words he was grinning clear across his face but i had not administered the grin she s the greatest that ever sniffed the breeze says he congrats says i i d like to have my thousand now if you please well luke says he i don t know that i ve had such a skyhoodlin fine time under your tutelage and dispensation but i ll do the best i can for you i ll do the best i can he repeats me and miss skinner was married an hour ago we re leaving for texas in the morning great says i consider yourself covered with rice and congress gaiters but don t let s tie so many satin bows on our business relations that we lose sight of em how about my honorarium missis mills says he has taken possession of my money and papers except six bits i told her what i d agreed to give you but she says it s an irreligious and illegal contract and she won t pay a cent of it but i ain t going to see you treated unfair says he i ve got eighty seven saddles on the ranch what i ve bought on this trip and when i get back i m going to pick out the best six in the lot and send em to you and did he i asked when lucullus ceased talking he did and they are fit for kings to ride on the six he sent me must have cost him three thousand dollars but where is the market for em who would buy one except one of these rajahs and princes of asia and africa i ve got em all on the list i know every tan royal dub and smoked princerino from mindanao to the caspian sea it s a long time between customers i ventured they re coming faster said polk nowadays when one of the murdering mutts gets civilised enough to abolish suttee and quit using his whiskers for a napkin he calls himself the roosevelt of the east and comes over to investigate our chautauquas and cocktails i ll place em all yet now look here from an inside pocket he drew a tightly folded newspaper with much worn edges and indicated a paragraph read that said the saddler to royalty the paragraph ran thus his highness seyyid feysal bin turkee imam of muskat is one of the most progressive and enlightened rulers of the old world his stables contain more than a thousand horses of the purest persian breeds it is said that this powerful prince contemplates a visit to the united states at an early date there said mr polk triumphantly my best saddle is as good as sold the one with turquoises set in the rim of the cantle have you three dollars that you could loan me for a short time it happened that i had and i did if this should meet the eye of the imam of muskat may it quicken his whim to visit the land of the free otherwise i fear that i shall be longer than a short time separated from my dollars three hygeia at the solito if you are knowing in the chronicles of the ring you will recall to mind an event in the early nineties when for a minute and sundry odd seconds a champion and a would be faced each other on the alien side of an international river so brief a conflict had rarely imposed upon the fair promise of true sport the reporters made what they could of it but divested of padding the action was sadly fugacious the champion merely smote his victim turned his back upon him remarking i know what i done to dat stiff and extended an arm like a ship s mast for his glove to be removed which accounts for a trainload of extremely disgusted gentlemen in an uproar of fancy vests and neck wear being spilled from their pullmans in san antonio in the early morning following the fight which also partly accounts for the unhappy predicament in which cricket mcguire found himself as he tumbled from his car and sat upon the depot platform torn by a spasm of that hollow racking cough so familiar to san antonian ears at that time in the uncertain light of dawn that way passed curtis raidler the nueces county cattleman may his shadow never measure under six foot two the cattleman out this early to catch the south bound for his ranch station stopped at the side of the distressed patron of sport and spoke in the kindly drawl of his ilk and region got it pretty bad bud cricket mcguire ex feather weight prizefighter tout jockey follower of the ponies all round sport and manipulator of the gum balls and walnut shells looked up pugnaciously at the imputation cast by bud g wan he rasped telegraph pole i didn t ring for yer another paroxysm wrung him and he leaned limply against a convenient baggage truck raidler waited patiently glancing around at the white hats short overcoats and big cigars thronging the platform you re from the no th ain t you bud he asked when the other was partially recovered come down to see the fight fight snapped mcguire puss in the corner twas a hypodermic injection handed him just one like a squirt of dope and he s asleep and no tanbark needed in front of his residence fight he rattled a bit coughed and went on hardly addressing the cattleman but rather for the relief of voicing his troubles no more dead sure t ings for me but rus sage himself would have snatched at it five to one dat de boy from cork wouldn t stay t ree rounds is what i invested in put my last cent on and could already smell the sawdust in dat all night joint of jimmy delaney s on t irty seventh street i was goin to buy and den say telegraph pole what a gazaboo a guy is to put his whole roll on one turn of the gaboozlum you re plenty right said the big cattleman more specially when you lose son you get up and light out for a hotel you got a mighty bad cough had it long lungs said mcguire comprehensively i got it the croaker says i ll come to time for six months longer maybe a year if i hold my gait i wanted to settle down

in de foist round say it s a hard deal commented raidler looking down at the diminutive form of mcguire crumpled against the truck but you go to a hotel and rest there s the menger and the maverick and and the fi th av noo and the waldorf astoria mimicked mcguire told you i went broke i m on de bum proper i ve got one dime left maybe a trip to europe or a sail in me private yacht would fix me up pa per he flung his dime at a newsboy got his express propped his back against the truck and was at once rapt in the account of his waterloo as expanded by the ingenious press curtis raidler interrogated an enormous gold watch and laid his hand on mcguire s shoulder come on bud he said we got three minutes to catch the train sarcasm seemed to be mcguire s vein you ain t seen me cash in any chips or call a turn since i told you i was broke a minute ago have you friend chase yourself away you re going down to my ranch said the cattleman and stay till you get well six months ll fix you good as new he lifted mcguire with one hand and half dragged him in the direction of the train what about the money said mcguire struggling weakly to escape money for what asked raidler puzzled they eyed each other not understanding for they touched only as at the gear of bevelled cog wheels at right angles and moving upon different axes passengers on the south bound saw them seated together and wondered at the conflux of two such antipodes mcguire was five feet one with a countenance belonging to either yokohama or dublin bright beady of eye bony of cheek and jaw scarred toughened broken and reknit indestructible grisly gladiatorial as a hornet he was a type neither new nor unfamiliar raidler was the product of a different soil six feet two in height miles broad and no deeper than a crystal brook he represented the union of the west and south few accurate pictures of his kind have been made for art galleries are so small and the mutoscope is as yet unknown in texas after all the only possible medium of portrayal of raidler s kind would be the fresco something high and simple and cool and unframed they were rolling southward on the international the timber was huddling into little dense green motts at rare distances before the inundation of the downright vert prairies this was the land of the ranches the domain of the kings of the kine mcguire sat collapsed into his corner of the seat receiving with acid suspicion the conversation of the cattleman what was the game of this big geezer who was carrying him off altruism would have been mcguire s last guess he ain t no farmer thought the captive and he ain t no con man for sure w at s his lay you trail in cricket and see how many cards he draws you re up against it anyhow you got a nickel and gallopin consumption and you better lay low lay low and see w at s his game at rincon a hundred miles from san antonio they left the train for a buckboard which was waiting there for raidler in this they travelled the thirty miles between the station and their destination if anything could this drive should have stirred the acrimonious mcguire to a sense of his ransom they sped upon velvety wheels across an exhilarant savanna the pair of spanish ponies struck a nimble tireless trot which gait they occasionally relieved by a wild untrammelled gallop the air was wine and seltzer perfumed as they absorbed it with the delicate redolence of prairie flowers the road perished and the buckboard swam the uncharted billows of the grass itself steered by the practised hand of raidler to whom each tiny distant mott of trees was a signboard each convolution of the low hills a voucher of course and distance but mcguire reclined upon his spine seeing nothing but a desert and receiving the cattleman s advances with sullen distrust w at s he up to was the burden of his thoughts w at kind of a gold brick has the big guy got to sell mcguire was only applying the measure of the streets he had walked to a range bounded by the horizon and the fourth dimension a week before while riding the prairies raidler had come upon a sick and weakling calf deserted and bawling without dismounting he had reached and slung the distressed bossy across his saddle and dropped it at the ranch for the boys to attend to it was impossible for mcguire to know or comprehend that in the eyes of the cattleman his case and that of the calf were identical in interest and demand upon his assistance a creature was ill and helpless he had the power to render aid these were the only postulates required for the cattleman to act they formed his system of logic and the most of his creed mcguire was the seventh invalid whom raidler had picked up thus casually in san antonio where so many thousand go for the ozone that is said to linger about its contracted streets five of them had been guests of solito ranch until they had been able to leave cured or better and exhausting the vocabulary of tearful gratitude one came too late but rested very comfortably at last under a ratama tree in the garden so then it was no surprise to the ranchhold when the buckboard spun to the door and raidler took up his debile protege like a handful of rags and set him down upon the gallery mcguire looked upon things strange to him the ranch house was the best in the country it was built of brick hauled one hundred miles by wagon but it was of but one story and its four rooms were completely encircled by a mud floor gallery the miscellaneous setting of horses dogs saddles wagons guns and cow punchers paraphernalia oppressed the metropolitan eyes of the wrecked sportsman well here we are at home said raidler cheeringly it s a h l of a looking place said mcguire promptly as he rolled upon the gallery floor in a fit of coughing we ll try to make it comfortable for you buddy said the cattleman gently it ain t fine inside but it s the outdoors anyway that ll do you the most good this ll be your room in here anything we got you ask for it he led mcguire into the east room the floor was bare and clean white curtains waved in the gulf breeze through the open windows a big willow rocker two straight chairs a long table covered with newspapers pipes tobacco spurs and cartridges stood in the centre some well mounted heads of deer and one of an enormous black javeli projected from the walls a wide cool cot bed stood in a corner nueces county people regarded this guest chamber as fit for a prince mcguire showed his eyeteeth at it he took out his nickel and spun it up to the ceiling t ought i was lyin about the money did ye well you can frisk me if you wanter dat s the last simoleon in the treasury who s goin to pay the cattleman s clear grey eyes looked steadily from under his grizzly brows into the huckleberry optics of his guest after a little he said simply and not ungraciously i ll be much obliged to you son if you won t mention money any more once was quite a plenty folks i ask to my ranch don t have to pay anything and they very scarcely ever offers it supper ll be ready in half an hour there s water in the pitcher and some cooler to drink in that red jar hanging on the gallery where s the bell asked mcguire looking about bell for what bell to ring for things i can t see here he exploded in a sudden weak fury i never asked you to bring me here i never held you up for a cent i never gave you a hard luck story till you asked me here i am fifty miles from a bellboy or a cocktail i m sick i can t hustle gee but i m up against it mcguire fell upon the cot and sobbed shiveringly raidler went to the door and called a slender bright complexioned mexican youth about twenty came quickly raidler spoke to him in spanish ylario it is in my mind that i promised you the position of vaquero on the san carlos range at the fall rodeo si senor such was your goodness listen this senorito is my friend he is very sick place yourself at his side attend to his wants at all times have much patience and care with him and when he is well or and when he is well instead of vaquero i will make you mayordomo of the rancho de las piedras esta bueno si si mil gracias senor ylario tried to kneel upon the floor in his gratitude but the cattleman kicked at him benevolently growling none of your opery house antics now ten minutes later ylario came from mcguire s room and stood before raidler the little senor he announced presents his compliments raidler credited ylario with the preliminary and desires some pounded ice one hot bath one gin feez z that the windows be all closed toast one shave one newyorkheral cigarettes and to send one telegram raidler took a quart bottle of whisky from his medicine cabinet here take him this he said thus was instituted the reign of terror at the solito ranch for a few weeks mcguire blustered and boasted and swaggered before the cow punchers who rode in for miles around to see this latest importation of raidler s he was an absolutely new experience to them he explained to them all the intricate points of sparring and the tricks of training and defence he opened to their minds view all the indecorous life of a tagger after professional sports his jargon of slang was a continuous joy and surprise to them his gestures his strange poses his frank ribaldry of tongue and principle fascinated them he was like a being from a new world strange to say this new world he had entered did not exist to him he was an utter egoist of bricks and mortar he had dropped out he felt into open space for a time and all it contained was an audience for his reminiscences neither the limitless freedom of the prairie days nor the grand hush of the close drawn spangled nights touched him all the hues of aurora could not win him from the pink pages of a sporting journal get something for nothing was his mission in life thirty seventh street was his goal nearly two months after his arrival he began to complain that he felt worse it was then that he became the ranch s incubus its harpy its old man of the sea he shut himself in his room like some venomous kobold or flibbertigibbet whining complaining cursing accusing the keynote of his plaint was that he had been inveigled into a gehenna against his will that he was dying of neglect and lack of comforts with all his dire protestations of increasing illness to the eye of others he remained unchanged his currant like eyes were as bright and diabolic as ever his voice was as rasping his callous face with the skin drawn tense as a drum head had no flesh to lose a flush on his prominent cheek bones each afternoon hinted that a clinical thermometer might have revealed a symptom and percussion might have established the fact that mcguire was breathing with only one lung but his appearance remained the same in constant attendance upon him was ylario whom the coming reward of the mayordomoship must have greatly stimulated for mcguire chained him to a bitter existence the air the man s only chance for life he commanded to be kept out by closed windows and drawn curtains the room was always blue and foul with cigarette smoke whosoever entered it must sit suffocating and listen to the imp s interminable gasconade concerning his scandalous career the oddest thing of all was the relation existing between mcguire and

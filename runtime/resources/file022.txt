them and then the waiter takes away the discard and gives you pears to fill on i was sure solly would be tickled to death with these hands after the bobtail flushes he d been eating on the ranch and i was a little anxious that he should for i didn t remember his having honoured my efforts with a smile since we left atascosa city we were in the main dining room and there was a fine dressed crowd there all talking loud and enjoyable about the two st louis topics the water supply and the colour line they mix the two subjects so fast that strangers often think they are discussing water colours and that has given the old town something of a rep as an art centre and over in the corner was a fine brass band playing and now thinks i solly will become conscious of the spiritual oats of life nourishing and exhilarating his system but nong mong frang he gazed across the table at me there was four square yards of it looking like the path of a cyclone that has wandered through a stock yard a poultry farm a vegetable garden and an irish linen mill solly gets up and comes around to me luke says he i m pretty hungry after our ride i thought you said they had some beans here i m going out and get something i can eat you can stay and monkey with this artificial layout of grub if you want to wait a minute says i i called the waiter and slapped s mills on the back of the check for thirteen dollars and fifty cents what do you mean says i by serving gentlemen with a lot of truck only suitable for deck hands on a mississippi steamboat we re going out to get something decent to eat i walked up the street with the unhappy plainsman he saw a saddle shop open and some of the sadness faded from his eyes we went in and he ordered and paid for two more saddles one with a solid silver horn and nails and ornaments and a six inch border of rhinestones and imitation rubies around the flaps the other one had to have a gold mounted horn quadruple plated stirrups and the leather inlaid with silver beadwork wherever it would stand it eleven hundred dollars the two cost him then he goes out and heads toward the river following his nose in a little side street where there was no street and no sidewalks and no houses he finds what he is looking for we go into a shanty and sit on high stools among stevedores and boatmen and eat beans with tin spoons yes sir beans beans boiled with salt pork i kind of thought we d strike some over this way says solly delightful says i that stylish hotel grub may appeal to some but for me give me the husky table d goat when we had succumbed to the beans i leads him out of the tarpaulin steam under a lamp post and pulls out a daily paper with the amusement column folded out but now what ho for a merry round of pleasure says i here s one of hall caine s shows and a stock yard company in hamlet and skating at the hollowhorn rink and sarah bernhardt and the shapely syrens burlesque company i should think now that the shapely but what does this healthy wealthy and wise man do but reach his arms up to the second story windows and gape noisily reckon i ll be going to bed says he it s about my time st louis is a kind of quiet place ain t it oh yes says i ever since the railroads ran in here the town s been practically ruined and the building and loan associations and the fair have about killed it guess we might as well go to bed wait till you see chicago though shall we get tickets for the big breeze to morrow mought as well says solly i reckon all these towns are about alike well maybe the wise cicerone and personal conductor didn t fall hard in chicago loolooville on the lake is supposed to have one or two things in it calculated to keep the rural visitor awake after the curfew rings but not for the grass fed man of the pampas i tried him with theatres rides in automobiles sails on the lake champagne suppers and all those little inventions that hold the simple life in check but in vain solly grew sadder day by day and i got fearful about my salary and knew i must play my trump card so i mentioned new york to him and informed him that these western towns were no more than gateways to the great walled city of the whirling dervishes after i bought the tickets i missed solly i knew his habits by then so in a couple of hours i found him in a saddle shop they had some new ideas there in the way of trees and girths that had strayed down from the canadian mounted police and solly was so interested that he almost looked reconciled to live he invested about nine hundred dollars in there at the depot i telegraphed a cigar store man i knew in new york to meet me at the twenty third street ferry with a list of all the saddle stores in the city i wanted to know where to look for solly when he got lost now i ll tell you what happened in new york i says to myself friend heherezade you want to get busy and make bagdad look pretty to the sad sultan of the sour countenance or it ll be the bowstring for yours but i never

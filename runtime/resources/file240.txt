my counting the ransom just as a business formality well no not exactly says the fat man not when it comes i turned that matter over to our second vice president i was anxious after brother jackson s safetiness i reckon he ll be along right soon what does that lobster salad you mentioned taste like brother jackson mr vice president says i you ll oblige us by remaining here till the second v p arrives this is a private rehearsal and we don t want any roadside speculators selling tickets in half an hour caligula sings out again sail ho looks like an apron on a broomstick i perambulated down the cliff again and escorted up a man six foot three with a sandy beard and no other dimension that you could notice thinks i to myself if he s got ten thousand dollars on his person it s in one bill and folded lengthwise mr patterson g coble our second vice president announces the colonel glad to know you gentlemen says this coble i came up to disseminate the tidings that major tallahassee tucker our general passenger agent is now negotiating a peachcrate full of our railroad bonds with the perry county bank for a loan my dear colonel rockingham was that chicken gumbo or cracked goobers on the bill of fare in your note me and the conductor of fifty six was having a dispute about it another white wings on the rocks hollers caligula if i see any more i ll fire on em and swear they was torpedo boats the guide goes down again and convoys into the lair a person in blue overalls carrying an amount of inebriety and a lantern i am so sure that this is major tucker that i don t even ask him until we are up above and then i discover that it is uncle timothy the yard switchman at edenville who is sent ahead to flag our understandings with the gossip that judge pendergast the railroad s attorney is in the process of mortgaging colonel rockingham s farming lands to make up the ransom while he is talking two men crawl from under the bushes into camp and caligula with no white flag to disinter him from his plain duty draws his gun but again colonel rockingham intervenes and introduces mr jones and mr batts engineer and fireman of train number forty two excuse us says batts but me and jim have hunted squirrels all over this mounting and we don t need no white flag was that straight colonel about the plum pudding and pineapples and real store cigars towel on a fishing pole in the offing howls caligula suppose it s the firing line of the freight conductors and brakeman my last trip down says i wiping off my face if the s e t wants to run an excursion up here just because we kidnapped their president let em we ll put out our sign the kidnapper s cafe and trainmen s home this time i caught major tallahassee tucker by his own confession and i felt easier i asked him into the creek so i could drown him if he happened to be a track walker or caboose porter all the way up the mountain he driveled to me about asparagus on toast a thing that his intelligence in life had skipped up above i got his mind segregated from food and asked if he had raised the ransom my dear sir says he i succeeded in negotiating a loan on thirty thousand dollars worth of the bonds of our railroad and never mind just now major says i it s all right then wait till after dinner and we ll settle the business all of you gentlemen i continues to the crowd are invited to stay to dinner we have mutually trusted one another and the white flag is supposed to wave over the proceedings the correct idea says caligula who was standing by me two baggage masters and a ticket agent dropped out of a tree while you was below the last time did the major man bring the money he says i answered that he succeeded in negotiating the loan if any cooks ever earned ten thousand dollars in twelve hours me and caligula did that day at six o clock we spread the top of the mountain with as fine a dinner as the personnel of any railroad ever engulfed we opened all the wine and we concocted entr es and pi ces de resistance and stirred up little savory chef de cuisines and organized a mass of grub such as has been seldom instigated out of canned and bottled goods the railroad gathered around it and the wassail and diversions was intense after the feast me and caligula in the line of business takes major tucker to one side and talks ransom the major pulls out an agglomeration of currency about the size of the price of a town lot in the suburbs of rabbitville arizona and makes this outcry gentlemen says he the stock of the sunrise edenville railroad has depreciated some the best i could do with thirty thousand dollars worth of the bonds was to secure a loan of eighty seven dollars and fifty cents on the farming lands of colonel rockingham judge pendergast was able to obtain on a ninth mortgage the sum of fifty dollars you will find the amount one hundred and thirty seven fifty correct a railroad president said i looking this tucker in the eye and the owner of a thousand acres of land and yet gentlemen says tucker the railroad is ten miles long there don t any train run on it except when the crew goes out in the pines and gathers enough lightwood knots to get up steam a long time ago when

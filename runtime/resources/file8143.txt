hello two by four was her usual greeting seems to me your store looks emptier you must have sold a pack of chewing gum ain t much room in here sure joe would answer with his slow grin except for you daise me and the store are waitin for you whenever you ll take us don t you think you might before long store a fine scorn was expressed by daisy s uptilted nose sardine box waitin for me you say gee you d have to throw out about a hundred pounds of candy before i could get inside of it joe i wouldn t mind an even swap like that said joe complimentary daisy s existence was limited in every way she had to walk sideways between the counter and the shelves in the candy store in her own hall bedroom coziness had been carried close to cohesiveness the walls were so near to one another that the paper on them made a perfect babel of noise she could light the gas with one hand and close the door with the other without taking her eyes off the reflection of her brown pompadour in the mirror she had joe s picture in a gilt frame on the dresser and sometimes but her next thought would always be of joe s funny little store tacked like a soap box to the corner of that great building and away would go her sentiment in a breeze of laughter daisy s other suitor followed joe by several months he came to board in the house where she lived his name was dabster and he was a philosopher though young attainments stood out upon him like continental labels on a passaic n j suit case knowledge he had kidnapped from cyclopedias and handbooks of useful information but as for wisdom when she passed he was left sniffling in the road without so much as the number of her motor car he could and would tell you the proportion of water and muscle making properties of peas and veal the shortest verse in the bible the number of pounds of shingle nails required to fasten shingles laid four inches to the weather the population of kankakee ill the theories of spinoza the name of mr h mckay twombly s second hall footman the length of the hoosac tunnel the best time to set a hen the salary of the railway post office messenger between driftwood and red bank furnace pa and the number of bones in the foreleg of a cat the weight of learning was no handicap to dabster his statistics were the sprigs of parsley with which he garnished the feast of small talk that he would set before you if he conceived that to be your taste and again he used them as breastworks in foraging at the boardinghouse firing at you a volley of figures concerning the weight of a lineal foot of bar iron x inches and the average annual rainfall at fort snelling minn he would transfix with his fork the best piece of chicken on the dish while you were trying to rally sufficiently to ask him weakly why does a hen cross the road thus brightly armed and further equipped with a measure of good looks of a hair oily shopping district at three in the afternoon kind it seems that joe of the lilliputian emporium had a rival worthy of his steel but joe carried no steel there wouldn t have been room in his store to draw it if he had one saturday afternoon about four o clock daisy and mr dabster stopped before joe s booth dabster wore a silk hat and well daisy was a woman and that hat had no chance to get back in its box until joe had seen it a stick of pineapple chewing gum was the ostensible object of the call joe supplied it through the open side of his store he did not pale or falter at sight of the hat mr dabster s going to take me on top of the building to observe the view said daisy after she had introduced her admirers i never was on a skyscraper i guess it must be awfully nice and funny up there h m said joe the panorama said mr dabster exposed to the gaze from the top of a lofty building is not only sublime but instructive miss daisy has a decided pleasure in store for her it s windy up there too as well as here said joe are you dressed warm enough daise sure thing i m all lined said daisy smiling slyly at his clouded brow you look just like a mummy in a case joe ain t you just put in an invoice of a pint of peanuts or another apple your stock looks awful over stocked daisy giggled at her favorite joke and joe had to smile with her your quarters are somewhat limited mr er er remarked dabster in comparison with the size of this building i understand the area of its side to be about by feet that would make you occupy a proportionate space as if half of beloochistan were placed upon a territory as large as the united states east of the rocky mountains with the province of ontario and belgium added is that so sport said joe genially you are weisenheimer on figures all right how many square pounds of baled hay do you think a jackass could eat if he stopped brayin long enough to keep still a minute and five eighths a few minutes later daisy and mr dabster stepped from an elevator to the top floor of the skyscraper then up a short steep stairway and out upon the roof dabster led her to the parapet so she could look down at the black dots moving in the street below what are they she asked trembling she had never before been on a height like this before and then dabster must needs play the philosopher on the tower and conduct her soul forth to meet the immensity of space bipeds he said solemnly see what they become even at the small elevation of feet mere crawling insects going to and fro at random oh they ain t anything of the kind exclaimed daisy suddenly they re folks i saw an automobile oh gee are we that high up walk over this way said dabster he showed her the great city lying like an orderly array of toys far below starred here and there early as it was by the first beacon lights of the winter afternoon and then the bay and sea to the south and east vanishing mysteriously into the sky i don t like it declared daisy with troubled blue eyes say we go down but the philosopher was not to be denied his opportunity he would let her behold the grandeur of his mind the half nelson he had on the infinite and the memory he had for statistics and then she would nevermore be content to buy chewing gum aat the smallest store in new york and so he began to prate of the smallness of human affairs and how that even so slight a removal from earth made man and his works look like one tenth part of a dollar thrice computed and that one should consider the sidereal system and the maxims of epictetus and be comforted you don t carry me with you said daisy say i think it s awful to be up so high that folks look like fleas one of them we saw might have been joe why jiminy we might as well be in new jersey say i m afraid up here the philosopher smiled fatuously the earth said he is itself only as a grain of wheat in space look up there daisy gazed upward apprehensively the short day was spent and the stars were coming out above yonder star said dabster is venus the evening star she is miles from the sun fudge said daisy with a brief flash of spirit where do you think i come from brooklyn susie price in our store her brother sent her a ticket to go to san francisco that s only three thousand miles the philosopher smiled indulgently our world he said is miles from the sun there are eighteen stars of the first magnitude that are times further from us than the sun is if one of them should be extinguished it would be three years before we would see its light go out there are six thousand stars of the sixth magnitude it takes thirty six years for the light of one of them to reach the earth with an eighteen foot telescope we can see stars including those of the thirteenth magnitude whose light takes years to reach us each of these stars you re lyin cried daisy angrily you re tryin to scare me and you have i want to go down she stamped her foot arcturus began the philosopher soothingly but he was interrupted by a demonstration out of the vastness of the nature that he was endeavoring to portray with his memory instead of his heart for to the heart expounder of nature the stars were set in the firmament expressly to give soft light to lovers wandering happily beneath them and if you stand tiptoe some september night with your sweetheart on your arm you can almost touch them with your hand three years for their light to reach us indeed out of the west leaped a meteor lighting the roof of the skyscraper almost to midday its fiery parabola was limned against the sky toward the east it hissed as it went and daisy screamed take me down she cried vehemently you you mental arithmetic dabster got her to the elevator and inside of it she was wild eyed and she shuddered when the express made its debilitating drop outside the revolving door of the skyscraper the philosopher lost her she vanished and he stood bewildered without figures or statistics to aid him joe had a lull in trade and by squirming among his stock succeeded in lighting a cigarette and getting one cold foot against the attenuated stove the door was burst open and daisy laughing crying scattering fruit and candies tumbled into his arms oh joe i ve been up on the skyscraper ain t it cozy and warm and homelike in here i m ready for you joe whenever you want me a bird of bagdad without a doubt much of the spirit and genius of the caliph harun al rashid descended to the margrave august michael von paulsen quigg quigg s restaurant is in fourth avenue that street that the city seems to have forgotten in its growth fourth avenue born and bred in the bowery staggers northward full of good resolutions where it crosses fourteenth street it struts for a brief moment proudly in the glare of the museums and cheap theatres it may yet become a fit mate for its high born sister boulevard to the west or its roaring polyglot broad waisted cousin to the east it passes union square and here the hoofs of the dray horses seem to thunder in unison recalling the tread of marching hosts hooray but now come the silent and terrible mountains buildings square as forts high as the clouds shutting out the sky where thousands of slaves bend over desks all day on the ground floors are only little fruit shops and laundries and book shops where you see copies of littell s living age and g w m reynold s novels in the windows and next poor fourth avenue the street glides into a mediaeval solitude on each side are shops devoted to antiques let us say it is night men in rusty armor stand in the windows and menace the hurrying cars with raised rusty iron gauntlets hauberks and helms blunderbusses cromwellian breastplates matchlocks creeses and the swords and daggers of an army of dead and gone gallants gleam dully in the ghostly light here and there from a corner saloon lit with jack o lanterns or phosphorus stagger forth shuddering home bound citizens nerved by the tankards within to their fearsome journey adown that eldrich avenue lined with the bloodstained weapons of the fighting dead what street could live inclosed by these mortuary relics and trod by these spectral citizens in whose sunken hearts scarce one good whoop or tra la la remained not fourth avenue not after the tinsel but enlivening glories of the little rialto not after the echoing drum beats of union square there need be no tears ladies and gentlemen tis but the suicide of a street with a shriek and a crash fourth avenue dives headlong into the tunnel at thirty fourth and is never seen again near the sad scene of the thoroughfare s dissolution stood the modest restaurant of quigg it stands there yet if you care to view its crumbling red brick front its show window heaped with oranges tomatoes layer cakes pies canned asparagus its papier m ach e lobster and two maltese kittens asleep on a bunch of lettuce if you care to sit at one of the little tables upon whose cloth has been traced in the yellowest of coffee stains the trail of the japanese advance to sit there with one eye on your umbrella and the other upon the bogus bottle from which you drop the counterfeit sauce foisted upon us by the cursed charlatan who assumes to be our dear old lord and friend the nobleman in india quigg s title came through his mother one of her ancestors was a margravine of saxony his father was a tammany brave on account of the dilution of his heredity he found that he could neither become a reigning potentate nor get a job in the city hall so he opened a restaurant he was a man full of thought and reading the business gave him a living though he gave it little attention one side of his house bequeathed to him a poetic and romantic adventure the other have him the restless spirit that made him seek adventure by day he was quigg the restaurateur by night he was the margrave the caliph the prince of bohemia going about the city in search of the odd the mysterious the inexplicable the recondite one night at at which hour the restaurant closed quigg set forth upon his quest there was a mingling of the foreign the military and the artistic in his appearance as he buttoned his coat high up under his short trimmed brown and gray beard and turned westward toward the more central life conduits of the city in his pocket he had stored an assortment of cards written upon without which he never stirred out of doors each of those cards was good at his own restaurant for its face value some called simply for a bowl of soup or sandwiches and coffee others entitled their bearer to one two three or more days of full meals a few were for single regular meals a very few were in effect meal tickets good for a week of riches and power margrave quigg had none but he had a caliph s heart it may be forgiven him if his head fell short of the measure of harun al rashid s perhaps some of the gold pieces in bagdad had put less warmth and hope into the complainants among the bazaars than had quigg s beef stew among the fishermen and one eyed calenders of manhattan continuing his progress in search of romance to divert him or of distress that he might aid quigg became aware of a fast gathering crowd that whooped and fought and eddied at a corner of broadway and the crosstown street that he was traversing hurrying to the spot he beheld a young man of an exceedingly melancholy and preoccupied demeanor engaged in the pastime of casting silver money from his pockets in the middle of the street with each motion of the generous one s hand the crowd huddled upon the falling largesse with yells of joy traffic was suspended a policman in the centre of the mob stooped often to the ground as he urged the blockaders to move on the margrave saw at a glance that here was food for his hunger after knowledge concerning abnormal working of the human heart he made his way swiftly to the young man s side and took his arm come with me at once he said in the low but commanding voice that his waiters had learned to fear pinched remarked the young man looking up at him with expressionless eyes pinched by a painless dentist take me away flatty and give me gas some lay eggs and some lay none when is a hen still deeply seized by some inward grief but tractable he allowed quigg to lead him away and down the street to a little park there seated on a bench he upon whom a corner of the great caliph s mantle has descended spake with kindness and discretion seeking to know what evil had come upon the other disturbing his soul and driving him to such ill considered and ruinous waste of his substance and stores i was doing the monte cristo act as adapted by pompton n j wasn t i asked the young man you were throwing small coins into the street for the people to scramble after said the margrave that s it you buy all the beer you can hold and then you throw chicken feed to oh curse that word chicken and hens feathers roosters eggs and everything connected with it young sir said the margrave kindly but with dignity though i do not ask your confidence i invite it i know the world and i know humanity man is my study though i do not eye him as the scientist eyes a beetle or as the philanthropist gazes at the objects of his bounty through a veil of theory and ignorance it is my pleasure and distraction to interest myself in the peculiar and complicated misfortunes that life in a great city visits upon my fellow men you may be familiar with the history of that glorious and immortal ruler the caliph harun al rashid whose wise and beneficent excursions among his people in the city of bagdad secured him the privilege of relieving so much of their distress in my humble way i walk in his footsteps i seek for romance and adventure in city streets not in ruined castles or in crumbling palaces to me the greatest marvels of magic are those that take place in men s hearts when acted upon by the furious and diverse forces of a crowded population in your strange behavior this evening i fancy a story lurks i read in your act something deeper than the wanton wastefulness of a spendthrift i observe in your countenance the certain traces of consuming grief or despair i repeat i invite your confidence i am not without some power to alleviate and advise will you not trust me gee how you talk exclaimed the young man a gleam of admiration supplanting for a moment the dull sadness of his eyes you ve got the astor library skinned to a synopsis of preceding chapters i mind that old turk you speak of i read the arabian nights when i was a kid he was a kind of bill devery and charlie schwab rolled into one but say you might wave enchanted dishrags and make copper bottles smoke up coon giants all night without ever touching me my case won t yield to that kind of treatment if i could hear your story said the margrave with his lofty serious smile i ll spiel it in about nine words said the young man with a deep sigh but i don t think you can help me any unless you re a peach at guessing it s back to the bosphorous for you on your magic linoleum the story of the young man and the

giving imitations of the old arab guy that gave away libraries in bagdad well now can you whistle up a fairy that ll solve this hen query or not when the young man ceased the margrave arose and paced to and fro by the park bench for several minutes finally he sat again and said in grave and impressive tones i must confess sir that during the eight years that i have spent in search of adventure and in relieving distress i have never encountered a more interesting or a more perplexing case i fear that i have overlooked hens in my researches and observations as to their habits their times and manner of laying their many varieties and cross breedings their span of life their oh don t make an ibsen drama of it interrupted the young man flippantly riddles especially old hildebrant s riddles don t have to be worked out seriously they are light themes such as sim ford and harry thurston peck like to handle but somehow i can t strike just the answer bill watson may and he may not to morrow will tell well your majesty i m glad anyhow that you butted in and whiled the time away i guess mr al rashid himself would have bounced back if one of his constituents had conducted him up against this riddle i ll say good night peace fo yours and what you may call its of allah the margrave still with a gloomy air held out his hand i cannot exppress my regret he said sadly never before have i found myself unable to assist in some way what kind of a hen lays the longest it is a baffling problem there is a hen i believe called the plymouth rock that cut it out said the young man the caliph trade is a mighty serious one i don t suppose you d even see anything funny in a preacher s defense of john d rockefeller well good night your nibs from habit the margrave began to fumble in his pockets he drew forth a card and handed it to the young man do me the favor to accept this anyhow he said the time may come when it might be of use to you thanks said the young man pocketing it carelessly my name is simmons shame to him who would hint that the reader s interest shall altogether pursue the margrave august michael von paulsen quigg i am indeed astray if my hand fail in keeping the way where my peruser s heart would follow then let us on the morrow peep quickly in at the door of hildebrant harness maker hildebrant s pounds reposed on a bench silverbuckling a raw leather martingale bill watson came in first vell said hildebrant shaking all over with the vile conceit of the joke maker haf you guessed him vat kind of a hen lays der longest er why i think so said bill

regarded him with dull savagery in his eye should he curse this mountain of pernicious humor curse him and die why should but there was laura dogged speechless he thrust his hands into his coat pockets and stood his hand encountered the strange touch of the margrave s card he drew it out and looked at it as men about to be hanged look at a crawling fly there was written on it in quigg s bold round hand good for one roast chicken to bearer simmons looked up with a flashing eye a dead one said he goot roared hildebrant rocking the table with giant glee dot is right you gome at mine house at o clock to der party compliments of the season there are no more christmas stories to write fiction is exhausted and newspaper items the next best are manufactured by clever young journalists who have married early and have an engagingly pessimistic view of life therefore for seasonable diversion we are reduced to very questionable sources facts and philosophy we will begin with whichever you choose to call it children are pestilential little animals with which we have to cope under a bewildering variety of conditions especially when childish sorrows overwhelm them are we put to our wits end we exhaust our paltry store of consolation and then beat them sobbing to sleep then we grovel in the dust of a million years and ask god why thus we call out of the rat trap as for the children no one understands them except old maids hunchbacks and shepherd dogs now comes the facts in the case of the rag doll the tatterdemalion and the twenty fifth of december on the tenth of that month the child of the millionaire lost her rag doll there were many servants in the millionaire s palace on the hudson and these ransacked the house and grounds but without finding the lost treasure the child was a girl of five and one of those perverse little beasts that often wound the sensibilities of wealthy parents by fixing their affections upon some vulgar inexpensive toy instead of upon diamond studded automobiles and pony phaetons the child grieved sorely and truly a thing inexplicable to the millionaire to whom the rag doll market was about as interesting as bay state gas and to the lady the child s mother who was all form that is nearly all as you shall see the child cried inconsolably and grew hollow eyed knock kneed spindling and corykilverty in many other respects the millionaire smiled and tapped his coffers confidently the pick of the output of the french and german toymakers was rushed by special delivery to the mansion but rachel refused to be comforted she was weeping for her rag child and was for a high protective tariff against all foreign foolishness then doctors with the finest bedside manners and stop watches were called in one by one they chattered futilely about peptomanganate of iron and sea voyages and hypophosphites until their stop watches showed that bill rendered was under the wire for show or place then as men they advised that the rag doll be found as soon as possible and restored to its mourning parent the child sniffed at therapeutics chewed a thumb and wailed for her betsy and all this time cablegrams were coming from santa claus saying that he would soon be here and enjoining us to show a true christian spirit and let up on the pool rooms and tontine policies and platoon systems long enough to give him a welcome everywhere the spirit of christmas was diffusing itself the banks were refusing loans the pawn brokers had doubled their gang of helpers people bumped your shins on the streets with red sleds thomas and jeremiah bubbled before you on the bars while you waited on one foot holly wreaths of hospitality were hung in windows of the stores they who had em were getting their furs you hardly knew which was the best bet in balls three high moth or snow it was no time at which to lose the rag doll or your heart if doctor watson s investigating friend had been called in to solve this mysterious disappearance he might have observed on the millionaire s wall a copy of the vampire that would have quickly suggested by induction a rag and a bone and a hank of hair flip a scotch terrier next to the rag doll in the child s heart frisked through the halls the hank of hair aha x the unfound quantity represented the rag doll but the bone well when dogs find bones they done it were an easy and a fruitful task to examine flip s forefeet look watson earth dried earth between the toes of course the dog but sherlock was not there therefore it devolves but topography and architecture must intervene the millionaire s palace occupied a lordly space in front of it was a lawn close mowed as a south ireland man s face two days after a shave at one side of it and fronting on another street was a pleasuance trimmed to a leaf and the garage and stables the scotch pup had ravished the rag doll from the nursery dragged it to a corner of the lawn dug a hole and buried it after the manner of careless undertakers there you have the mystery solved and no checks to write for the hypodermical wizard of fi pun notes to toss to the sergeant then let s get down to the heart of the thing tiresome readers the christmas heart of the thing fuzzy was drunk not riotously or helplessly or loquaciously as you or i might get but decently appropriately and inoffensively as becomes a gentleman down on his luck fuzzy was a soldier of misfortune the road the haystack the park bench the kitchen door the bitter round of eleemosynary beds with shower bath attachment the petty pickings and ignobly garnered largesse of great cities these formed the chapters of his history fuzzy walked toward the river down the street that bounded one side of the millionaire s house and grounds he saw a leg of betsy the lost rag doll protruding like the clue to a lilliputian murder mystery from its untimely grave in a corner of the fence he dragged forth the maltreated infant tucked it under his arm and went on his way crooning a road song of his brethrren that no doll that has been brought up to the sheltered life should hear well for betsy that she had no ears and well that she had no eyes save unseeing circles of black for the faces of fuzzy and the scotch terrier were those of brothers and the heart of no rag doll could withstand twice to become the prey of such fearsome monsters though you may not know it grogan s saloon stands near the river and near the foot of the street down which fuzzy traveled in grogan s christmas cheer was already rampant fuzzy entered with his doll he fancied that as a mummer at the feast of saturn he might earn a few drops from the wassail cup he set betsy on the bar and addressed her loudly and humorously seasoning his speech with exaggerated compliments and endearments as one entertaining his lady friend the loafers and bibbers around caught the farce of it and roared the bartender gave fuzzy a drink oh many of us carry rag dolls one for the lady suggested fuzzy impudently and tucked another contribution to art beneath his waistcoat he began to see possibilities in betsy his first night had been a success visions of a vaudeville circuit about town dawned upon him in a group near the stove sat pigeon mccarthy black riley and one ear mike well and unfavorably known in the tough shoestring district that blackened the left bank of the river they passed a newspaper back and forth among themselves the item that each solid and blunt forefinger pointed out was an advertisement headed one hundred dollars reward to earn it one must return the rag doll lost strayed or stolen from the millionaire s mansion it seemed that grief still ravaged unchecked in the bosom of the too faithful child flip the terrier capered and shook his absurd whisker before her powerless to distract she wailed for her betsy in the faces of walking talking mama ing and eye closing french mabelles and violettes the advertisement was a last resort black riley came from behind the stove and approached fuzzy in his one sided parabolic way the christmas mummer flushed with success had tucked betsy under his arm and was about to depart to the filling of impromptu dates elsewhere say bo said black riley to him where did you cop out dat doll this doll asked fuzzy touching betsy with his forefinger to be sure that she was the one referred to his doll was presented to me by the emperor of beloochistan i have seven hundred others in my country home in newport this doll cheese the funny business said riley you swiped it or picked it up at de house on de hill where but never mind dat you want to take fifty cents for de rags and take it quick me brother s kid at home might be wantin to play wid it hey what he produced the coin fuzzy laughed a gurgling insolent alcoholic laugh in his face go to the office of sarah bernhardt s manager and propose to him that she be released from a night s performance to entertain the tackytown lyceum and literary coterie you will hear the duplicate of fuzzy s laugh black riley gauged fuzzy quickly with his blueberry eye as a wrestler does his hand was itching to play the roman and wrest the rag sabine from the extemporaneous merry andrew who was entertaining an angel unaware but he refrained fuzzy was fat and solid and big three inches of well nourished corporeity defended from the winter winds by dingy linen intervened between his vest and trousers countless small circular wrinkles running around his coat sleeves and knees guaranteed the quality of his bone and muscle his small blue eyes bathed in the moisture of altruism and wooziness looked upon you kindly yet without abashment he was whiskerly whiskyly fleshily formidable so black riley temporized wot ll you take for it den he asked money said fuzzy with husky firmness cannot buy her he was intoxicated with the artist s first sweet cup of attainment to set a faded blue earth stained rag doll on a bar to hold mimic converse with it and to find his heart leaping with the sense of plaudits earned and his throat scorching with free libations poured in his honor could base coin buy him from such achievements you will perceive that fuzzy had the temperament fuzzy walked out with the gait of a trained sea lion in search of other caf es to conquer though the dusk of twilight was hardly yet apparent lights were beginning to spangle the city like pop corn bursting in a deep skillet christmas eve impatiently expected was peeping over the brink of the hour millions had prepared for its celebration towns would be painted red you yourself have heard the horns and dodged the capers of the saturnalians pigeon mccarthy black riley and one ear mike held a hasty converse outside grogan s they were narrow chested pallid striplings not fighters in the open but more dangerous in their ways of warfare than the most terrible of turks fuzzy in a pitched battle could have eaten the three of them in a go as you please encounter he was already doomed they overtook him just as he and betsy were entering costigan s casino they deflected him and shoved the newspaper under his nose fuzzy could read and more boys said he you are certainly damn true friends give me a week to think it over the soul of a real artist is quenched with difficulty the boys carefully pointed out to him that advertisements were soulless and that the deficiencies of the day might not be supplied by the morrow a cool hundred said fuzzy thoughtfully and mushily booys said he you are true friends i ll go up and claim the reward the show business is not what it used to be night was falling more surely the three tagged at his sides to the foot of the rise on which stood the millionaire s house there fuzzy turned upon them acrimoniously you are a pack of putty faced beagle hounds he roared go away they went away a little way in pigeon mccarthy s pocket was a section of one inch gas pipe eight inches long in one end of it and in the middle of it was a lead plug one half of it was packed tight with solder black riley carried a slung shot being a conventional thug one ear mike relied upon a pair of brass knucks an heirloom in the family why fetch and carry said black riley when some one will do it for ye let him bring it out to us hey what we can chuck him in the river said pigeon mccarthy with a stone tied to his feet youse guys make me tired said one ear mike sadly ain t progress ever appealed to none of yez sprinkle a little gasoline on im and drop im on the drive well fuzzy entered the millionaire s gate and zigzagged toward the softly glowing entrance of the mansion the three goblins came up to the gate and lingered one on each side of it one beyond the roadway they fingered their cold metal and leather confident fuzzy rang the door bell smiling foolishly and dreamily an atavistic instrinct prompted him to reach for the button of his right glove but he wore no gloves so his left hand dropped embarrassed the particular menial whose duty it was to open doors to silks and laces shied at first sight of fuzzy but a second glance took in his passport his card of admission his surety of welcome the lost rag doll of the daughter of the house dangling under his arm fuzzy was admitted into a great hall dim with the glow from unseen lights the hireling went away and returned with a maid and the child the doll was restored to the mourning one she clasped her lost darling to her breast and then with the inordinate selfishness and candor of childhood stamped her foot and whined hatred and fear of the odious being who had rescued her from the depths of sorrow and despair fuzzy wriggled himself into an ingratiatory attitude and essayed the idiotic smile and blattering small talk that is supposed to charm the budding intellect of the young the child bawled and was dragged away hugging her betsy close there came the secretary pale poised polished gliding in pumps and worshipping pomp and ceremony he counted out into fuzzy s hand ten ten dollar bills then dropped his eye upon the door transferred it to james its custodian indicated the obnoxious earner of the reward with the other and allowed his pumps to waft him away to secretarial regions james gathered fuzzy with his own commanding optic and swept him as far as the front door when the money touched fuzzy s dingy palm his first instinct was to take to his heels but a second thought restrained him from that blunder of etiquette it was his it had been given him it and oh what an elysium it opened to the gaze of his mind s eye he had tumbled to the foot of the ladder he was hungry homeless friendless ragged cold drifting and he held in his hand the key to a paradise of the mud honey that he craved the fairy doll had waved a wand with her rag stuffed hand and now wherever he might go the enchanted palaces with shining foot rests and magic red fluids in gleaming glassware would be open to him he followed james to the door he paused there as the flunky drew open the great mahogany portal for him to pass into the vestibule beyond the wrought iron gates in the dark highway black riley and his two pals casually strolled fingering under their coats the inevitably fatal weapons that were to make the reward of the rag doll theirs fuzzy stopped at the millionaire s door and bethought himself like little sprigs of mistletoe on a dead tree certain living green thoughts and memories began to decorate his confused mind he was quite drunk mind you and the present was beginning to fade those wreaths aand festoons of holly with their scarlet berries making the great hall gay where had he seen such things before somewhere he had known polished floors and odors of fresh flowers in winter and and some one was singing a song in the house that he thought he had heard before some one singing and playing a harp of course it was christmas fuzzy though he must have been pretty drunk to have overlooked that and then he went out of the present and there came back to him out of some impossible vanished and irrevocable past a little pure white transient forgotten ghost the spirit of nobless oblige upon a gentleman certain things devolve james opened the outer door a stream of light went down the graveled walk to the iron gate black riley mccarthy and one ear mike saw and carelessly drew their sinister cordon closer about the gate with a more imperious gesture than james s master had ever used or could ever use fuzzy compelled the menial to close the door upon a gentleman certain things devolve especially at the christmas season it is cust customary he said to james the flustered when a gentleman calls on christmas eve to pass the compliments of the season with the lady of the house you und stand i shall not move shtep till i pass compl ments season with lady the house und stand there was an argument james lost fuzzy raised his voice and sent it through the house unpleasantly i did not say he was a gentleman he was simply a tramp being visited by a ghost a sterling silver bell rang james went back to answer it leaving fuzzy in the hall james explained somewhere to some one then he came and conducted fuzzy into the library the lady entered a moment later she was more beautiful and holy than any picture that fuzzy had seen she smiled and said something about a doll fuzzy didn t understand that he remembered nothing about a doll a footman brought in two small glasses of sparkling wine on a stamped sterling silver waiter the lady took one the other was handed to fuzzy as his fingers closed on the slender glass stem his disabilities dropped from him for one brief moment he straightened himself and time so disobliging to most of us turned backward to accomodate fuzzy forgotten christmas ghosts whiter than the false beards of the most opulent kris kringle were rising in the fumes of grogan s whisky what had the millionaire s mansion to do with a long wainscoted virginia hall where the riders were grouped around a silver punch bowl drinking the ancient toast of the house and why should the patter of the cab horses hoofs on the frozen street be in any wise related to the sound of the saddled hunters stamping under the shelter of the west veranda and what had fuzzy to do with any of it the lady looking at him over her glass let her condescending smile fade away like a false dawn her eyes turned serious she saw something beneath the rags and scotch terrier whiskers that she did not understand but it did not matter fuzzy lifted his glass and smiled vacantly p pardon lady he said but couldn t leave without exchangin comp ments sheason with lady th house gainst princ ples gen leman do sho and then he began the ancient salutation that was a tradition in the house when men wore lace ruffles and powder the blessings of another year fuzzy s memory failed him the lady prompted be upon this hearth the guest stammered fuzzy and upon her who continued the lady with a leading smile oh cut it out said fuzzy ill manneredly i can t remember drink hearty fuzzy had shot his arrow they drank the lady smiled again the smile of her caste james enveloped and re conducted him toward the front door the harp music still softly drifted through the house outside black riley breathed on his cold hands and hugged the gate i wonder said the lady to herself musing who but there were so many who came i wonder whether memory is a curse or a blessing to them after they have fallen so low fuzzy and his escort were nearly at the door the lady called james james stalked back obsequiously leaving fuzzy waiting unsteadily with his brief spark of the divine fire gone outside black riley stamped his cold feet and got a firmer grip on his section of gas pipe you will conduct this gentleman said the lady downstairs then tell louis to get out the mercedes and take him to whatever place he wishes to go a night in new arabia the great city of bagdad on the subway is caliph ridden its palaces bazaars khans and byways are thronged with al rashids in divers disguises seeking diversion and victims for their unbridled generosity you can scarcely find a poor beggar whom they are willing to let enjoy his spoils unsuccored nor a wrecked unfortunate upon whom they will not reshower the means of fresh misfortune you will hardly find anywhere a hungry one who has not had the opportunity to tighten his belt in gift libraries nor a poor pundit who has not blushed at the holiday basket of celery crowned turkey forced resoundingly through his door by the eleemosynary press so then fearfully through the harun haunted streets creep the one eyed calenders the little hunchback and the barber s sixth brother hoping to escape the ministrations of the roving horde of caliphoid sultans entertainment for many arabian nights might be had from the histories of those who have escaped the largesse of the army of commanders of the faithful until dawn you might sit on the enchanted rug and listen to such stories as are told of the powerful genie roc ef el er who sent the forty thieves to soak up the oil plant of ali baba of the good caliph kar neg ghe who gave away palaces of the seven voyages of sailbad the sinner who frequented wooden excursion steamers among the islands of the fisherman and the bottle of the barmecides boarding house of aladdin s rise to wealth by means of his wonderful gasmeter but now there being ten sultans to one sheherazade she is held too valuable to be in fear of the bowstring in consequence the art of narrative languishes and as the lesser caliphs are hunting the happy poor and the resigned unfortunate from cover to cover in order to heap upon them strange mercies and mysterious benefits too often comes the report from arabian headquarters that the captive refused to talk this reticence then in the actors who perform the sad comedies of their philanthropy scourged world must in a degree account for the shortcomings of this painfully gleaned tale which shall be called the story of the caliph who alleviated his conscience old jacob spraggins mixed for himself some scotch and lithia water at his oak sideboard inspiration must have resulted from its imbibition for immediately afterward he struck the quartered oak soundly with his fist and shouted to the empty dining room by the coke ovens of hell it must be that ten thousand dollars if i can get that squared it ll do the trick thus by the commonest artifice of the trade having gained your interest the action of the story will now be suspended leaving you grumpily to consider a sort of dull biography beginning fifteen years before when old jacob was young jacob he was a breaker boy in a pennsylvania coal mine i don t know what a breaker boy is but his occupation seems to be standing by a coal dump with a wan look and a dinner pail to have his picture taken for magazine articles anyhow jacob was one but instead of dying of overwork at nine and leaving his helpless parents and brothers at the mercy of the union strikers reserve fund he hitched up his galluses put a dollar or two in a side proposition now and then and at forty five was worth there now it s over hardly had time to yawn did you i ve seen biographies that but let us dissemble i want you to consider jacob spraggins esq after he had arrived at the seventh stage of his career the stages meant are first humble origin second deserved promotion third stockholder fourth capitalist fifth trust magnate sixth rich malefactor seventh caliph eighth x the eighth stage shall be left to the higher mathematics at fifty five jacob retired from active business the income of a czar was still rolling in on him from coal iron real estate oil railroads manufactories and corporations but none of it touched jacob s hands in a raw state it was a sterilized increment carefully cleaned and dusted and fumigated until it arrived at its ultimate stage of untainted spotless checks in the white fingers of his private secretary jacob built a three million dollar palace on a corner lot fronting on nabob avenue city of new bagdad and began to feel the mantle of the late h a rashid descending upon him eventually jacob slipped the mantle under his collar tied it in a neat four in hand and became a licensed harrier of our mesopotamian proletariat when a man s income becomes so large that the butcher actually sends him the kind of steak he orders he begins to think about his soul s salvation now the various stages or classes of rich men must not be forgotten the capitalist can tell you to a dollar the amount of his wealth the trust magnate estimates it the rich malefactor hands you a cigar and denies that he has bought the p d q the caliph merely smiles and talks about hammerstein and the musical lasses there is a record of tremendous altercation at breakfast in a where to dine well tavern between a magnate and his wife the rift within the loot being that the wife calculated their fortune at a figure higher than did her future divorc oh well i myself heard a similar quarrel between a man and his wife because he found fifty cents less in his pockets than he thought he had after all we are all human count tolstoi r fitzsimmons peter pan and the rest of us don t lose heart because the story seems to be degenerating into a sort of moral essay for intellectual readers there will be dialogue and stage business pretty soon when jacob first began to compare the eyes of needles with the camels in the zoo he decided upon organized charity he had his secretary send a check for one million to the universal benevolent association of the globe you may have looked down through a grating in front of a decayed warehouse for a nickel that you had dropped through but that is neither here nor there the association acknowledged receipt of his favor of the th ult with enclosure as stated separated by a double line but still mighty close to the matter under the caption of oddities of the day s news in an evening paper jacob spraggins read that one jasper spargyous had donated to the u b a of g a camel may have a stomach for each day in the week but i dare not venture to accord him whiskers for fear of the great displeasure at washington but if he have whiskers surely not one of them will seem to have been inserted in the eye of a needle by that effort of that rich man to enter the k of h the right is reserved to reject any and all bids signed s peter secretary and gatekeeper next jacob selected the best endowed college he could scare up and presented it with a laboratory the college did not maintain a scientific course but it accepted the money and built an elaborate lavatory instead which was no diversion of funds so far as jacob ever discovered the faculty met and invited jacob to come over and take his a b c degree before sending the invitation they smiled cut out the c added the proper punctuation marks and all was well while walking on the campus before being capped and gowned jacob saw two professors strolling nearby their voices long adapted to indoor acoustics undesignedly reached his ear there goes the latest chevalier d industrie said one of them to buy a sleeping powder from us he gets his degree to morrow in foro conscientai said the other let s eave arf a brick at im jacob ignored the latin but the brick pleasantry was not too hard for him there was no mandragora in the honorary draught of learning that he had bought that was before the passage of the pure food and drugs act jacob wearied of philanthropy on a large scale if i could see folks made happier he said to himself if i could see em myself and hear em express their gratitude for what i done for em it would make me feel better this donatin funds to institutions and societies is about as satisfactory as dropping money into a broken slot machine so jacob followed his nose which led him through unswept streets to the homes of the poorest the very thing said jacob i will charter two river steamboats pack them full of these unfortunate children and say ten thousand dolls and drums and a thousand freezers of ice cream and give them a delightful outing up the sound the sea breezes on that trip ought to blow the taint off some of this money that keeps coming in faster than i can work it off my mind jacob must have leaked some of his benevolent intentions for an immense person with a bald face and a mouth that looked as if it ought to have a drop letters here sign over it hooked a finger around him and set him in a space between a barber s pole and a stack of ash cans words came out of the post office slit smooth husky words with gloves on em but sounding as if they might turn to bare knuckles any moment say sport do you know where you are at well dis is mike o grady s district you re buttin into see mike s got de stomach ache privilege for every kid in dis neighborhood see and if dere s any picnics or red balloons to be dealt out here mike s money pays for em see don t you butt in or something ll be handed to you youse d settlers and reformers with your social ologies and your millionaire detectives have got dis district in a hell of a fix anyhow with your college students and professors rough housing de soda water stands and dem rubber neck coaches fillin de streets de folks down here are fraid to go out of de houses now you leave em to mike dey belongs to him and he knows how to handle em keep on your own side of de town are you some wiser now uncle or do you want to scrap wit mike o grady for de santa claus belt in dis district clearly that spot in the moral vineyard was preempted so caliph spraggins menaced no more the people in the bazaars of the east side to keep down his growing surplus he doubled his donations to organized charity presented the y m c a of his native town with a collection of butterflies and sent a check to the famine sufferers in china big enough to buy new emerald eyes and diamond filled teeth for all their gods but none of these charitable acts seemed to bring peace to the caliph s heart he tried to get a personal note into his benefactions by tipping bellboys and waiters and bills he got well snickered at and derided for that by the minions who accept with respect gratuities commensurate to the service performed he sought out an ambitious and talented but poor young woman and bought for her the star part in a new comedy he might have gotten rid of more of his cumbersome money in this philanthropy if he

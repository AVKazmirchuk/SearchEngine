danny the head bartender through the crack of the door here s a nip for ye mike ould man behind the widespread amicable columns of the press policeman o brine receives swiftly his nip of the real stuff he moves away stalwart refreshed fortified to his duties might not the editor man view with pride the early the spiritual the literal fruit that had blessed his labours policeman o brine folded the paper and poked it playfully under the arm of a small boy that was passing that boy was named johnny and he took the paper home with him his sister was named gladys and she had written to the

of the real thing on the street she met the brown girl from the flat below and stopped to talk the brown girl turned green only silk at a yard could make the sound that she heard when gladys moved the

went loyally to the proving of its potency when johnny returned from school he sought a secluded spot and removed the missing columns from the inside of his clothing where they had been artfully distributed so as to successfully defend such areas as are generally attacked during scholastic castigations johnny attended a private school and had had trouble with his teacher as has been said there was an excellent editorial against corporal punishment in that morning s issue and no doubt it had its effect after this can any one doubt the power of the press tommy s burglar at ten o clock p

burglar got into the house without much difficulty because we must have action and not too much descrip tion in a word story in the dining room he opened the slide of his dark lantern with a brace and

think he was out of the city just twice before the time i m going to tell you about once he went rabbit shooting in yonkers the other time i met him just landing from a north river ferry been out west on a big trip sully old boy says he gad sully i had no idea we had such a big country it s immense never conceived of the magnificence of the west before it s gorgeous and glorious and infinite makes the east seemed cramped and little it s a grand thing to travel and get an idea of the extent and resources of our country i d made several little runs out to california and down to mexico and up through alaska so i sits down with denver for a chat about the things he saw took in the yosemite out there of course i asks well no says denver i don t think so at least i don t recollect it you see i only had three days and i didn t get any farther west than youngstown ohio about two years ago i dropped into new york with a little fly paper proposition about a tennessee mica mine that i wanted to spread out in a nice sunny window in the hopes of catching a few i was coming out of a printing shop one afternoon with a batch of fine sticky prospectuses when i ran against denver coming round a corner i never saw him looking so much like a tiger lily he was as beautiful and new as a trellis of sweet peas and as rollicking as a clarinet solo we shook hands and he asked me what i was doing and i gave him the outlines of the scandal i was trying to create in mica pooh pooh for your mica says denver don t you know better sully than to bump up against the coffers of little old new york with anything as transparent as mica now you come with me over to the hotel brunswick you re just the man i was hoping for i ve got something there in sepia and curled hair that i want you to look at you putting up at the brunswick i asks not a cent says denver cheerful the syndicate that owns the hotel puts up i m manager the brunswick wasn t one of them broadway pot houses all full of palms and hyphens and flowers and costumes kind of a mixture of lawns and laundries it was on one of the east side avenues but it was a solid old time caravansary such as the mayor of skaneatelese or the governor of missouri might stop at eight stories high it stalked up with new striped awnings and the electrics had it as light as day i ve been manager here for a year says denver as we drew nigh when i took charge says he nobody nor nothing ever stopped at the brunswick the clock over the clerks desk used to run for weeks without winding a man fell dead with heart disease on the sidewalk in front of it one day and when they went to pick him up he was two blocks away i figured out a scheme to catch the west indies and south american trade i persuaded the owners to invest a few more thousands and i put every cent of it in electric lights cayenne papre gold leaf and garlic i got a spanish speaking force of employees and a string band and there was talk going round of a cockfight in the basement every sunday maybe i didn t catch the nut brown gang from havana to patagonia the don senors knew about the brunswick we get the highfliers from cuba and mexico and the couple of americas farther south and they ve simply got the boodle to bombard every bulfinch in the bush with when we got to the hotel denver stops me at the door there s a little liver coloured man says he sitting in a big leather chair to your right inside you sit down and watch him for a few minutes and then tell me what you think i took a chair while denver circulates around in the big rotunda the room was about full of curly headed cubans and south american brunettes of different shades and the atmosphere was international with cigarette smoke lit up by diamond rings and edged off with a whisper of garlic that denver galloway was sure a relief to the eye six feet two he was red headed and pink gilled as a sun perch and the air he had court of saint james chauncy olcott kentucky colonels count of monte cristo grand opera all these things he reminded you of when he was doing the honours when he raised his finger the hotel porters and bell boys skated across the floor like cockroaches and even the clerk behind the desk looked as meek and unimportant as andy carnegie denver passed around shaking hands with his guests and saying over the two or three spanish words he knew until it was like a coronation rehearsal or a bryan barbecue in texas i watched the little man he told me to twas a little foreign person in a double breasted frock coat trying to touch the floor with his toes he was the colour of vici kid and his whiskers was like excelsior made out of mahogany wood he breathed hard and he never once took his eyes off of denver there was a look of admiration and respect on his face like you see on a boy that s following a champion base ball team or the kaiser william looking at himself in a glass after denver goes his rounds he takes me into his private office what s your report on the dingy i told you to watch he asks well says i

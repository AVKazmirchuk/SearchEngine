there were more changes on the bill of fare than usual the soups were lighter pork was eliminated from the entrees figuring only with russian turnips among the roasts the gracious spirit of spring pervaded the entire menu lamb that lately capered on the greening hillsides was becoming exploited with the sauce that commemorated its gambols the song of the oyster though not silenced was diminuendo con amore the frying pan seemed to be held inactive behind the beneficent bars of the broiler the pie list swelled the richer puddings had vanished the sausage with his drapery wrapped about him barely lingered in a pleasant thanatopsis with the buckwheats and the sweet but doomed maple sarah s fingers danced like midgets above a summer stream down through the courses she worked giving each item its position according to its length with an accurate eye just above the desserts came the list of vegetables carrots and peas asparagus on toast the perennial tomatoes and corn and succotash lima beans cabbage and then sarah was crying over her bill of fare tears from the depths of some divine despair rose in her heart and gathered to her eyes down went her head on the little typewriter stand and the keyboard rattled a dry accompaniment to her moist sobs for she had received no letter from walter in two weeks and the next item on the bill of fare was dandelions dandelions with some kind of egg but bother the egg dandelions with whose golden blooms walter had crowned her his queen of love and future bride dandelions the harbingers of spring her sorrow s crown of sorrow

she fingered the typewriter keys absently for a little while with her mind and heart in the meadow lane with her young farmer but soon she came swiftly back to the rock bound lanes of manhattan and the typewriter began to rattle and jump like a strike breaker s motor car at o clock the waiter brought her dinner and carried away the typewritten bill of fare when sarah ate she set aside with a sigh the dish of dandelions with its crowning ovarious accompaniment as this dark mass had been transformed from a bright and love indorsed flower to be an ignominious vegetable so had her summer hopes wilted and perished love may as shakespeare said feed on itself but sarah could not bring herself to eat the dandelions that had graced as ornaments the first spiritual banquet of her heart s

yes you would just as she did and then a strong voice was heard in the hall below and sarah jumped for her door leaving the book on the floor and the first round easily the bear s you have guessed it she reached the top of the stairs just as her farmer came up three at a jump and reaped and garnered her with nothing left for the gleaners why haven t you written oh why cried sarah new york is a

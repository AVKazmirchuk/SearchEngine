affection was a spiritual one in fact al though the lady aroused my deepest sentiments and was as i thought my ideal woman i never met her and never spoke to her it was an ideal love my love for you while no less ideal is different you wouldn t let that come between us was she pretty i asked she was very beautiful said arthur did you see her often i asked something like a dozen times says he always from a distance says i always from quite a distance says he and you loved her i asked she seemed my ideal of beauty and grace and soul says arthur and this keepsake that you keep under lock and key and moon over at times is that a remembrance from her a memento says arthur that i have treasured did she send it to you it came to me from her says be in a roundabout way i asked somewhat roundabout says he and yet rather direct why didn t you ever meet her i asked were your positions in life so different she was far above me says arthur now ida he goes on this is all of the past you re not going to be jealous are you jealous says i why man what are you talking about it makes me think ten times as much of you as i did before i knew about it and it did lynn if you can understand it that ideal love was a new one on me but it struck me as being the most beautiful and glorious thing i d ever heard of think of a man loving a woman he d never even spoken to and being faithful just to what his mind and heart pictured her oh it sounded great to me the men i d always known come at you with either diamonds knock out drops or a raise of salary and their ideals well we ll say no more yes it made me think more of arthur than i did before i couldn t be jealous of that far away divin ity that he used to worship for i was going to have him myself and i began to look upon him as a saint on earth just as old lady gurley did about four o clock this afternoon a man came to the house for arthur to go and see somebody that was sick among his church bunch old lady gurley was taking her afternoon snore on a couch so that left me pretty much alone in passing by arthur s study i looked in and saw his bunch of keys hanging in the drawer of his desk where he d forgotten em well i guess we re all to the mrs bluebeard now and then ain t we lynn i made up my mind i d have a look at that memento he kept so secret not that i cared what it was it was just curiosity while i was opening the drawer i imagined one or two things it might be i thought it might be a dried rosebud she d dropped down to him from a balcony or maybe a picture of her he d cut out of a magazine she being so high up in the world i opened the drawer and there was the rosewood casket about the size of a gent s collar box i found the little key in the bunch that fitted it and unlocked it and raised the lid i took one look at that memento and then i went to my room and packed my trunk i threw a few things into my grip gave my hair a flirt or two with a side comb put on my hat and went in and gave the old lady s foot a kick i d tried awfully hard to use proper and correct language while i was there for arthur s sake and i had the habit down pat but it left me then stop sawing gourds says i and sit up and take notice the ghost s about to walk i m going away from here and i owe you eight dollars the expressman will call for my trunk i handed her the money dear me miss crosby says she is any thing wrong i thought you were pleased here dear me young women are so hard to understand and so different from what you expect em to be you re damn right says i some of em are but you can t say that about men when you know one man you know em all that settles the human race question and then i caught the four thirty eight soft coal unlimited and here i am you didn t tell me what was in the box lee said miss d armande anxiously one of those yellow silk garters that i used to kick off my leg into the audience during that old vaudeville swing act of mine is there any of the cocktail left lynn waifs and strays the red roses of tonia a trestle burned down on the international railroad the south bound from san antonio was cut off for the next forty eight hours on that train was tonia weaver s easter hat espirition the mexican who had been sent forty miles in a buckboard from the espinosa ranch to fetch it returned with a shrugging shoulder and hands empty except for a cigarette at the small station nopal he had learned of the delayed train and having no commands to wait turned his ponies toward the ranch again now if one supposes that easter the goddess of spring cares any more for the after church parade on fifth avenue than she does for her loyal outfit of subjects that assemble at the meeting house at cactus tex a mistake has been made the wives and daughters of the ranchmen of the

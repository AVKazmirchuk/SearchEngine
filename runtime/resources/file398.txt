defy my overseers and they make friends with my dogs and you madame feed them before my eyes and intimidate me when i would interfere tell us please how many to day did you thus incite to future laziness and depredation six i think said madame with a reflective smile but you know two of them offered to work for you heard them yourself the planter s disconcerting laugh rang out again yes at their own trades and one was an artificial flower maker and the other a glass blower oh they were looking for work not a hand would they consent to lift to labour of any other kind and another one continued the soft hearted mistress used quite good language it was really extraordinary for one of his class and he carried a watch and had lived in boston i don t believe they are all bad they have always seemed to me to rather lack development i always look upon them as children with whom wisdom has remained at a standstill while whiskers have continued to grow we passed one this evening as we were driving home who had a face as good as it was incompetent he was whistling the intermezzo from cavalleria and blowing the spirit of mascagni himself into it a bright eyed young girl who sat at the left of the mistress leaned over and said in a confidential undertone i wonder mamma if that tramp we passed on the road found my stocking and do you think he will hang it up to night now i can hang up but one do you know why i wanted a new pair of silk stockings when i have plenty well old aunt judy says if you hang up two that have never been worn santa claus will fill one with good things and monsieur pambe will place in the other payment for all the words you have spoken good or bad on the day before christmas that s why i ve been unusually nice and polite to everyone to day monsieur pambe you know is a witch gentleman he the words of the young girl were interrupted by a startling thing like the wraith of some burned out shooting star a black streak came crashing through the window pane and upon the table where it shivered into fragments a dozen pieces of crystal and china ware and then glanced between the heads of the guests to the wall imprinting therein a deep round indentation at which to day the visitor to bellemeade marvels as he gazes upon it and listens to this tale as it is told the women screamed in many keys and the men sprang to their feet and would have laid their hands upon their swords had not the verities of chronology forbidden the planter was the first to act he sprang to the intruding missile and held it up to view by jupiter he cried a meteoric shower of hosiery has communication at last been established with mars i should say ahem venus ventured a young gentleman visitor looking hopefully for approbation toward the unresponsive young lady visitors the planter held at arm s length the unceremonious visitor a long dangling black stocking it s loaded he announced as he spoke he reversed the stocking holding it by the toe and down from it dropped a roundish stone wrapped about by a piece of yellowish paper now for the first interstellar message of the century he cried and nodding to the company who had crowded about him he adjusted his glasses with provoking deliberation and examined it closely when he finished he had changed from the jolly host to the practical decisive man of business he immediately struck a bell and said to the silent footed mulatto man who responded go and tell mr wesley to get reeves and maurice and about ten stout hands they can rely upon and come to the hall door at once tell him to have the men arm themselves and bring plenty of ropes and plough lines tell him to hurry and then he read aloud from the paper these words to the gent of de hous dere is five tuff hoboes xcept meself in the

half hour which ended in five disgusted and sullen tramps being captured and locked securely in an outhouse pending the coming of the morning and retribution for another result the visiting young gentlemen had secured the unqualified worship of the visiting young ladies by their distinguished and heroic conduct for still another behold whistling dick the hero seated at the planter s table feasting upon viands his experience had never before included and waited upon by admiring femininity in shapes of such beauty and swellness that even his ever full mouth could scarcely prevent him from whistling he was made to disclose in detail his adventure with the evil gang of boston harry and how he cunningly wrote the note and wrapped it around the stone and placed it at the toe of the stocking and watching his chance sent it silently with a wonderful centrifugal momentum like a comet at one of the big lighted windows

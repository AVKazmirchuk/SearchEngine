is here in my words and on his responsibility one afternoon at three o clock on the island of ratona a boy raced alongthe beach screaming pajaro ahoy thus he made known the keenness of his hearing and the justice of his discrimination in pitch he who first heard and made oral proclamation con cerning the toot of an approaching steamer s whistle and correctly named the steamer was a small hero in ratona until the next steamer came wherefore there was rivalry among the barefoot youth of ratona and many fell victims to the softly blown conch shells of sloops which as they enter harbour sound surprisingly like a distant steamer s signal and some could name you the vessel when its call in your duller ears sounded no louder than the sigh of the wind through the branches of the cocoa nut palms but to day he who proclaimed the pajaro gained his honours ratona bent its ear to listen and soon the deep tongued blast grew louder and nearer and at length ratona saw above the line of palms on the low joint the two black funnels of the fruiter slowly creeping toward the mouth of the harbour you must know that ratona is an island twenty miles off the south of a south american republic it is a port of that republic and it sleeps sweetly in a smiling sea toiling not nor spinning fed by the abundant tropics where all things ripen cease and fall toward the grave eight hundred people dream life away in a green embowered village that follows the horseshoe curve of its bijou harbour they are mostly spanish and indian mestizos with a shading of san domingo negroes a lightening of pure blood spanish officials and a slight leavening of the froth of three or four pioneering white races no steamers touch at ratona save the fruit steamers which take on their banana inspectors there on their way to the coast they leave sunday newspapers ice quinine bacon watermelons and vaccine matter at the island and that is about all the touch ratona gets with the world the pajaro paused at the mouth of the harbour roll ing heavily in the swell that sent the whitecaps racing beyond the smooth water inside already two dories from the village one conveying fruit inspectors the other going for what it could get were halfway out to the steamer the inspectors dory was taken on board with them and the pajaro steamed away for the mainland for its load of fruit the other boat returned to ratona bearing a contri bution from the pajaro s store of ice the usual roll of newspapers and one passenger taylor plunkett sheriff of chatham county kentucky bridger the united states consul at ratona was clean ing his rifle in the official shanty under a bread fruit tree twenty yards from the water of the harbour the consul occupied a place somewhat near the tail of his political party s procession the music of the band wagon sounded very faintly to him in the distance the plums of office went to others bridger s share of the spoils the consulship at ratona was little more than a prune a dried prune from the boarding house department of the public crib but yearly was opulence in ratona besides bridger had contracted a passion for shooting alligators in the lagoons near his consulate and was not unhappy he looked up from a careful inspection of his rifle lock a broad man filling his doorway a broad noiseless slow moving man sunburned almost to the vandyke a man of forty five neatly clothed in homespun with scanty light hair a close clipped brown and gray beard and pale blue eyes expressing mildness implicity you are mr bridger the consul said the broad man they directed me here can you tell me what those big bunches of things like gourds are in those trees that look like feather dusters along the edge of the water take that chair said the consul reoiling his clean ing rag no the other one that bamboo thing won t hold you why they re cocoanuts green cocoanuts the shell of em is always a light green before they re ripe much obliged said the other man sitting down carefully i didn t quite like to tell the folks at home they were olives unless i was sure about it my name is plunkett i m sheriff of chatham county kentucky i ve got extradition papers in my pocket authorizing the arrest of a man on this island they ve been signed by the president of this country and they re in correct shape the man s name is wade williams he s in the cocoa nut raising business what he s wanted for is the murder of his wife two years ago where can i find him the consul squinted an eye and looked through his rifle barrel there s nobody on the island who calls himself wil liams he remarked didn t suppose there was said plunkett mildly he ll do by any other name besides myself said bridger there are only two americans on ratona bob reeves and henry morgan the man i want sells cocoanuts suggested plunkett you see that cocoanut walk extending up to the point said the consul waving his hand toward the open door that belongs to bob reeves henry morgan owns half the trees to loo ard on the island one month ago said the sheriff wade williams wrote a confidential letter to a man in chatham county telling him where he was and how he was getting along the letter was lost

reeves or morgan

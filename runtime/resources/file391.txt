told him that politics down in that tropical atmosphere was bound to be different from the nineteenth district but i might just as well have been a congressman from north dakota trying to get an appropriation for a lighthouse and a coast survey denver galloway had ambitions in the manager line and what i said didn t amount to as much as a fig leaf at the national dressmakers convention i ll give you three days to cogitate about going says denver and i ll introduce you to general rompiro to morrow so you can get his ideas drawn right from the rosewood i put on my best reception to booker washington manner the next day and tapped the distinguished rubber plant for what he knew general rompiro wasn t so gloomy inside as he appeared on the surface he was polite enough and he exuded a number of sounds that made a fair stagger at arranging themselves into language it was english he aimed at and when his system of syntax reached your mind it wasn t past you to understand it if you took a college professor s magazine essay and a chinese laundryman s explanation of a lost shirt and jumbled em together you d have about what the general handed you out for conversation he told me all about his bleeding country and what they were trying to do for it before the doctor came but he mostly talked of denver c galloway ah senor says he that is the most fine of mans never i have seen one man so magnifico so gr r rand so conformable to make done things so swiftly by other mans he shall make other mans do the acts and himself to order and regulate until we arrive at seeing accomplishments of a suddenly oh yes senor in my countree there is not such mans of so beegness so good talk so compliments so strongness of sense and such ah that senor galloway yes says i old denver is the boy you want he s managed every kind of business here except filibustering and he might as well complete the list before the three days was up i decided to join denver in his campaign denver got three months vacation from his hotel owners for a week we lived in a room with the general and got all the pointers about his country that we could interpret from the noises he made when we got ready to start denver had a pocket full of memorandums and letters from the general to his friends and a list of names and addresses of loyal politicians who would help along the boom of the exiled popular idol besides these liabilities we carried assets to the amount of in assorted united states currency general rompiro looked like a burnt effigy but he was br er fox himself when it came to the real science of politics here is moneys says the general of a small amount there is more with me moocho more plentee moneys shall you be supplied senor galloway more i shall send you at all times that you need i shall desire to pay feefty one hundred thousand pesos if necessario to be elect how no sacramento if that i am president and do not make one meelion dolla in the one year you shall keek me on that side valgame dios denver got a cuban cigar maker to fix up a little cipher code with english and spanish words and gave the general a copy so we could cable him bulletins about the election or for more money and then we were ready to start general rompiro escorted us to the steamer on the pier he hugged denver around the waist and sobbed noble mans says he general rompiro propels you into his confidence and trust go in the hands of the saints to do the work for your friend viva la libertad sure says denver and viva la liberality an la soaperino and hoch der land of the lotus and the vote us don t worry general we ll have you elected as sure as bananas grow upside down make pictures on me pleads the general make pictures on me for money as it is needful does he want to be tattooed would you think asks denver wrinkling up his eyes stupid says i he wants you to draw on him for election expenses it ll be worse than tattooing more like an autopsy me and denver steamed down to panama and then hiked across the isthmus and then by steamer again down to the town of espiritu on the coast of the general s country that was a town to send j howard payne to the growler i ll tell you how you could make one like it take a lot of filipino huts and a couple of hundred brick kilns and arrange em in squares in a cemetery cart down all the conservatory plants in the astor and vanderbilt greenhouses and stick em about wherever there s room turn all the bellevue patients and the barbers convention and the tuskegee school loose in the streets and run the thermometer up to in the shade set a fringe of the rocky mountains around the rear let it rain and set the whole business on rockaway beach in the middle of january and you d have a good imitation of espiritu it took me and denver about a week to get acclimated denver sent out the letters the general had given him and notified the rest of the gang that there was something doing at the captain s office we set up headquarters in an old dobe house on a side street where the grass was waist high the election was only four weeks off but there wasn t any excitement the home candidate for president was named roadrickeys this town of esperitu wasn t the capital any more

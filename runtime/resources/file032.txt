red frame a neat carpet was under foot a pitcher sweating cold drops and a glass stood on a fragile stand in a willow rocker reading a newspaper sat alvarita spanish you would say andalusian or better

haughty and bold touched with a pretty insolence that gave it life to hasten conviction of her charm but glance at the stacks of handbills in the corner green and yellow and white upon them you see an incompetent presentment of the senorita in her professional garb and pose irresistible in black lace and yellow ribbons she faces you a blue racer is spiralled upon each bare arm coiled twice about her waist and once about her neck his horrid head close to hers you perceive kuku the great eleven foot asian python a hand drew aside the curtain that partitioned the car and a middle aged faded woman holding a knife and a half peeled potato looked in and said alviry are you right busy i m reading the home paper ma what do you think that pale tow headed matilda price got the most votes in the

see kuku outside they simply scoot away and buy bromides there s a crick over between here and the river that old scamp d swap his skin any time for a drink of running water i guess i ll find him there all right a few minutes later alvarita stopped upon the forward platform ready for her quest her handsome black skirt was shaped to the most recent proclamation of fashion her spotless shirt

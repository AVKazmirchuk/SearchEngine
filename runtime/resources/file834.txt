it perceiving no light or sound but he raised his voice hailing loudly reckless of everything but that he should find the old mischief maker with the eyes that looked too far awav to see the disaster he had wrought the door opened and in the stream of light father rogan stood his book in hand with his finger marking the place ah cried lorison you are the man i want i had a wife of you a few hours ago i would not trouble you but i neglected to note how it was done will you oblige me with the information whether the business is beyond remedy come inside said the priest there are other lodgers in the house who might prefer sleep to even a gratified curiosity lorison entered the room and took the chair offered him the priest s eyes looked a courteous interrogation i must apologize again said the young man for so soon intruding upon you with my marital infelicities but as my wife has neglected to furnish me with her address i am deprived of the legitimate recourse of a family row i am quite a plain man said father rogan pleas antly but i do not see how i am to ask you questions pardon my indirectness said lorison i will ask one in this room to night you pronounced me to be a husband you afterward spoke of additional rites or performances that either should or could be effected i paid little attention to your words then but i am hungry to hear them repeated now as matters stand am i married past all help you are as legally and as firmly bound said the priest as though it had been done in a cathedral in the presence of thousands the additional observances i referred to are not necessary to the strictest legality of the act but were advised as a precaution for the future for convenience of proof in such contingencies as wills inheritances and the like lorison laughed harshly many thanks he said then there is no mistake and i am the happy benedict i suppose i should go stand upon the bridal corner and when my wife gets through walking the streets she will look me up father rogan regarded him calmly my son he said when a man and woman come to me to be married i always marry them i do this for the sake of other people whom they might go away and marry if they did not marry each other as you see i do not seek your confidence but your case seems to me to be one not altogether devoid of interest very few marriages that have come to my notice have brought such well expressed regret within so short a time i will hazard one question were you not under the impression that you loved the lady you married at the time you did so loved her cried lorison wildly never so well as now though she told me she deceived and sinned and stole never more than now when perhaps she is laughing at the fool she cajoled and left with scarcely a word to return to god only knows what particular line of her former folly father rooan answered nothing during the silence that succeeded he sat with a quiet expectation beaming in his full lambent eye if you would listen began lorison the priest held up his hand as i hoped he said i thought you would trust me wait but a moment he brought a long clay pipe filled and lighted it now my son he said lorison poured a twelve month s accumulated con fidence into father rogan s ear he told all not sparing himself or omitting the facts of his past the events of the night or his disturbing conjectures and fears the main point said the priest when he had con cluded seems to me to be this are you reasonably sure that you love this woman whom you have married why exclaimed lorisoii rising impulsively to his feet why should i deny it but look at me am fish flesh or fowl that is the main point to me assure you i understand you said the priest also risino and laying down his pipe the situation is one that has taxed the endurance of much older men than you in fact especially much older men than you i will try to relieve you from it and this night you shall see for yourself into exactly what predicament you have fallen and how you shall possibly be extricated there is no evidence so credible as that of the eyesight father rogan moved about the room and donned a soft black hat buttoning his coat to his throat he laid his hand on the doorknob let us walk he said the two went out upon the street the priest turned his face down it and lorison walked with him through a squalid district where the houses loomed awry and desoiate looking high above them presently they turned into a less dismal side street where the houses were smaller and though hinting of the most meagre comfort lacked the concentrated wretchedness of the more populous byways at a segregated two story house father rogan halted and mounted the steps with the confidence of a familiar visitor he ushered lorison into a narrow hallway faintly lighted by a cobwebbed hanging lamp almost immediately a door to the right opened and a dingy irish woman protruded her head good evening to ye mistress geehan said the priest unconsciously it seemed falling into a delicately flavoured brogue and is it yourself can tell me if norah has gone out again the night maybe oh it s yer blissid reverence sure and i can tell ye the same the purty darlin wint out as usual but a bit later and she says mother geehan says she it s me last noight

reputable house he will settle at one eighty five said dodson bolivar cannot carry double a blackjack bargainer the most disreputable thing in yancey goree s law office was goree himself sprawled in his creakv old arm chair the rickety little office built of red brick was set flush with the street the main street of the town of bethel bethel rested upon the foot hills of the blue ridge above it the mountains were piled to the sky far below it the turbid catawba gleamed yellow along its disconsolate valley the june day was at its sultriest hour bethel dozed in the tepid shade trade was not it was so still that goree reclining in his chair distinctly heard the clicking of the chips in the grand jury room where the court house gang was playing poker from the open back door of the office a well worn path meandered across the grassy lot to the court house the treading out of that path had cost goree all he ever had first inheritance of a few thousand dollars next the old family home and latterly the last shreds of his self respect and manhood the gang had cleaned him out the broken gambler had turned drunkard and parasite he had lived to see this day come when the men who had stripped him denied him a seat at the game his word was no longer to be taken the daily bouts at cards had arranged itself accordingly and to him was assigned the ignoble part of the onlooker the sheriff the county clerk a sportive deputy a gay attorney and a chalk faced man hailing from the valley sat at table and the sheared one was thus tacitly advised to go and grow more wool soon wearying of his ostracism goree had departed for his office muttering to himself as he unsteadily traversed the unlucky pathway after a drink of corn whiskey from a demijohn under the table he had flung himself into the chair staring in a sort of maudlin apathy out at the mountains immersed in the summer haze the little white patch he saw away up on the side of blackjack was laurel the village near which he had been born and bred there also was the birthplace of the feud between the gorees and the coltranes now no direct heir of the gorees survived except this plucked and singed bird of misfortune to the coltranes also but one male supporter was left colonel abner col trane a man of substance and standing a member of the state legislature and a contemporary with goree s father the feud had been a typical one of the region it had left a red record of hate wrong and slaughter but yancey goree was not thinking of feuds his befuddled brain was hopelessly attacking the problem of the future maintenance of himself and his favourite follies of late old friends of the family had seen to it that he had whereof to eat and a place to sleep but whiskey they would not buy for him and he must have whiskey his law business was extinct no case had been intrusted to him in two years he had been a borrower and a sponge and it seemed that if he fell no lower it would be from lack of opportunity one more chance he was saying to himself if he had one more stake at the game he thought he could win but he had nothing left to sell and his credit was more than exhausted he could not help smiling even in his misery as he thought of the man to whom six months before he had sold the old goree homestead there had come from back yan in the mountains two of the strangest creatures a man named pike garvey and his wife back yan with a wave of the hand toward the hills was understood among the mountaineers to designate the remotest fastnesses the unplumbed gorges the haunts of lawbreakers the wolf s den and the boudoir of the bear in the cabin far up on blackjack s shoulder in the wildest part of these retreats this odd couple had lived for twenty years they had neither dog nor children to mitigate the heavy silence of the hills pike garvey was little known in the settlements but all who had dealt with him pronounced him crazy as a loon he acknowledged no occupation save that of a squirrel hunter but he moonshined occasionally by way of diversion once the revenues had dragged him from his lair fighting silently and desperately like a terrier and he had been sent to state s prison for two years released he popped back into his hole like an angry weasel fortune passing over many anxious wooers made a freakish flight into blackjack s bosky pockets to smile upon pike and his faithful partner one day a party of spectacled knickerbockered and altogether absurd prospectors invaded the vicinity of the garvey s cabin pike lifted his squirrel rifle off the hooks and took a shot at them at long range on the chance of their being revenues happily he missed and the unconscious agents of good luck drew nearer disclosing their innocence of anything resembling law or justice later on they offered the garveys an enormous quantity of ready green crisp money for their thirty acre patch of cleared land mentioning as an excuse for such a mad action some irrelevant and inadequate nonsense about a bed of mica underlying the said property when the garveys became possessed of so many dol lars that they faltered in computing them the deficiencies of life on blackjack began to grow prominent pike began to talk of new shoes a hogshead of tobacco to set in the corner a new lock to his rifle and leading martella to a certain spot on the mountain side he pointed out to her how a small cannon doubtless a thing not beyond the scope of their fortune in price might be planted so as to command and defend the sole accessible trail to the cabin to the confusion of revenues and meddling strangers forever but adam reckoned without his eve these things represented to him the applied power of wealth but there slumbered in his dingy cabin an ambition that soared far above his primitive wants somewhere in mrs garvey s bosom still survived a spot of femininity unstarved by twenty years of blackjack for so long a time the sounds in her ears had been the scaly barks dropping in the woods at noon and the wolves singing among the rocks at night and it was enough to have purged her of vanities she had grown fat and sad and yellow and dull but when the means came she felt a rekindled desire to assume the perquisites of her sex to sit at tea tables to buy futile things to whitewash the hideous veracity of life with a little form and ceremony so she coldly vetoed pike s proposed system of fortifica tions and announced that thev would descend upon the world and gyrate socially and thus at length it was decided and the thing done the village of laurel was their compromise between mrs garvey s preference for one of the large valley towns and pike s hankering for primeval solitudes laurel yielded a halting round of feeble social distractions omportable with martella s ambitions and was not entirely without recommendation to pike its contiguity to the mountains presenting advantages for sudden retreat in case fashionable society should make it advisable their descent upon laurel had been coincident with yancey goree s feverish desire to convert property into cash and they bought the old goree homestead paying four thousand dollars ready money into the spendthrift s shaking hands thus it happened that while the disreputable last of the gorees sprawled in his disreputable office at the end of his row spurned by the cronies whom he had gorged strangers dwelt in the halls of his fathers a cloud of dust was rolling slowly up the parched street with something travelling in the midst of it a little breeze wafted the cloud to one side and a new brightly painted carryall drawn by a slothful gray horse became visible the vehicle deflected from the middle of the street as it neared goree s office and stopped in the gutter directly in front of his door on the front seat sat a gaunt tall man dressed in black broadcloth his rigid hands incarcerated in yellow kid gloves on the back seat was a lady who triumphed over the june heat her stout form was armoured in a skintight silk dress of the description known as change able being a gorgeous combination of shifting hues she sat erect waving a much omamented fan with her eyes fixed stonily far down the street however martella garvey s heart might be rejoicing at the pleasures of her new life blackjack had done his work with her exterior he had carved her countenance to the image of emptiness and inanity had imbued her with the stolidity of his crags and the reserve of his hushed interiors she always seemed to hear whatever her surroundings were the scaly barks falling and pattering down the mountain side she could always hear the awful silence of black jack sounding through the stillest of nights goree watched this solemn equipage as it drove to his door with only faint interest but when the lank driver wrapped the reins about his whip awkwardly descended and stepped into the office he rose unsteadily to receive him recognizing pike garvey the new the transformed the recently civilized the mountaineer took the chair goree offered him they who cast doubts upon garvey s soundness of mind had a strong witness in the man s countenance his face was too long a dull saffron in hue and immobile as a statue s pale blue unwinking round eyes without lashes added to the singularity of his gruesome visage goree was at a loss to account for the visit everything all right at laurel mr garvey he inquired everything all right sir and mighty pleased is missis garvey and me with the property missis garvey likes yo old place and she likes the neighbourhood society is what she lows she wants and she is gettin of it the rogerses the hapgoods the pratts and the troys hev been to see missis garvey and she hev et meals to most of thar houses the best folks hev axed her to differ nt kinds of doin s i cyan t say mr goree that sech things suits me fur me give me them thar garvey s huge yellow gloved hand flourished in the direction of the mountains that s whar i b long mongst the wild honey bees and the b ars but that ain t what i come fur to say mr goree thar s somethin you got what me and missis garvey wants to buy buy echoed goree from me then he laughed harshly i reckon you are mistaken about that i reckon you are mistaken about that i sold out to you as you yourself expressed it lock stock and barrel there isn t even a ramrod left to sell you ve got it and we uns want it take the money says missis garvey and buy it fa r and squared goree shook his head the cupboard s bare he said we ve riz pursued the mountaineer undetected from his object a heap we was pore as possums and now we could hev folks to dinner every day we been recognized missis garvey says by the best society but there s somethin we need we ain t got she says it ought to been put in the ventory ov the sale but it tain t thar take the money then says she and buy it fa r and squar out with it said goree his racked nerves growing impatient garvey threw his slouch bat upon the table and leaned forward fixing his unblinking eves upon goree s there s a old feud he said distinctly and slowly tween you uns and the coltranes goree frowned ominously to speak of his feud to a feudist is a serious breach of the mountain etiquette the man from back yan knew it as well as the lawyer did na offense he went on but purely in the way of business missis garvey hev studied all about feuds most of the quality folks in the mountains hev em the settles and the goforths the rankins and the boyds the silers and the galloways hev all been cyarin on feuds f om twenty to a hundred year the last man to drap was when yo uncle jedge paisley goree journed co t and shot len coltrane f om the bench missis garvey and me we come f om the po white trash nobody wouldn t pick a feud with we uns no mo n with a fam ly of tree toads quality people everywhar says missis garvey has feuds we uns ain t quality but we re uyin into it as fur as we can take the money then says missis garvey and buy mr goree s feud fa r and squar the squirrel hunter straightened a leg half across the room drew a roll of bills from his pocket and threw them on the table thar s two hundred dollars mr goree what you would call a fa r price for a feud that s been lowed to run down like yourn hev thar s only you left to cyar on yo side of it and you d make mighty po killin i ll take it off yo hands and it ll set me and missis garvey up among the quality thar s the money the little roll of currency on the table slowly untwisted itself writhing and jumping as its folds relaxed in the silence that followed garvey s last speech the rattling of the poker chips in the court house could be plainly heard goree knew that the sheriff had just won a pot for the subdued whoop with which he always greeted a victory floated across the sqquare upon the crinkly heat waves beads of moisture stood on goree s brow stooping he drew the wicker covered demijohn from under the table and filled a tumbler from it a little corn liquor mr garvey of course you are joking about what you spoke of opens quite a new market doesn t it feuds prime two fifty to three feuds slightly damaged two hundred i believe you said mr garvey goree laughed self consciously the mountaineer took the glass goree handed him and drank the whisky without a tremor of the lids of his staring eyes the lawyer applauded the feat by a look of envious admiration he poured his own drink and took it like a drunkard by gulps and with shudders at the smell and taste two hundred repeated garvey thar s the money a sudden passion flared up in goree s brain he struck the table with his fist one of the bills flipped over and touched his hand he flinched as if something had stung him do you come to me he shouted seriously with such a ridiculous insulting darned fool proposition it s fa r and squar said the squirrel hunter but he reached out his hand as if to take back the money and then goree knew that his own flurry of rage had not been from pride or resentment but from anger at himself knowing that he would set foot in the deeper depths that were being opened to him he turned in an instant from an outraged gentleman to an anxious chafferer recom mending his goods don t be in a hurry garvey he said his face crimson and his speech thick i accept your p p proposition though it s dirt cheap at two hundred a t trade s all right when both p purchaser and b buyer are s satisfied shall i w wrap it up for you mr garvey garvey rose and shook out his broadcloth missis garvev will be pleased you air out of it and it stands coltrane and garvey just a scrap ov writin mr goree you bein a lawyer to show we traded goree seized a sheet of paper and a pen the money was clutched in his moist hand everything else sud denly seemed to grow trivial and light bill of sale by all means right title and interest in and to forever warrant and no garvey we ll have to leave out that defend said goree with a loud laugh you ll have to defend this title yourself the mountaineer received the amazing screed that the lawyer handed him folded it with immense labour and laced it carefully in his pocket goree was standing near the window step here said raising his finger and i ll show you your recently purchased enemy there he goes down the other side of the street the mountaineer crooked his long frame to look through the window in the direction indicated by the other colonel abner coltrane an erect portly gentleman of about fifty wearing the inevitable long double breasted frock coat of the southern lawmaker and an old high silk hat was passing on the opposite sidewalk as garvey looked goree glanced at his face if there be such a thing as a yellow wolf here was its counterpart garvey snarled as his unhuman eyes followed the moving figure disclosing long amber coloured fangs is that him why that s the man who sent me to the penitentiary once he used to be district attorney said goree care lessly and by the way he s a first class shot i kin hit a squirrel s eye at a hundred yard said garvey so that thar s coltrane i made a better trade than i was thinkin i ll take keer ov this feud mr goree better n you ever did he moved toward the door but lingered there betray ing a slight perplexity anything else to day inquired goree with frothy sarcasm any family traditions ancestral ghosts or skeletons in the closet prices as low as the lowest thar was another thing replied the unmoved squirrel hunter that missis garvey was thinkin of tain t so much in my line as t other but she wanted partic lar that i should inquire and ef you was willin pay fur it she says fa r and squar thar s a buryin groun as you know mr goree in the yard of yo old place under the cedars them that lies thar is yo folks what was killed by the coltranes the monyments has the names on em missis garvev says a fam ly buryin groun is a sho sign of quality she says ef we git the feud thar s somethin else ought to go with it the names on them moiivments is goree but they can be changed to ourn by go go screamed goree his face turning purple he stretched out both hands toward the mountaineer his fingers hooked and shaking go you ghoul even a ch chinaman protects the g graves of his ancestors go the squirrel hunter slouched out of the door to his carryall while he was climbing over the wheel goree was collecting with feverish celerity the money that had fallen from his hand to the floor as the vehicle slowly turned about the sheep with a coat of newly grown wool was hurrying in indecent haste along the path to the court house at three o clock in the morning they brought him back to his office shorn and unconscious the sheriff the sportive deputy the county clerk and the gay attorney carried him the chalk faced man from the valley acting as escort on the table said one of them and they deposited him there among the litter of his unprofitable books and papers yance thinks a lot of a pair of deuces when he s liquored up sighed the sheriff reflectively too much said the gay attorney a man has no business to play poker who drinks as much as he does i wonder how much he dropped to night close to two hundred what i wonder is whar he got it yance ain t had a cent fur over a month i know struck a client maybe well let s get home before daylight he ll be all right when he wakes up except for a sort of beehive about the cranium the gang slipped away through the early morning twilight the next eye to gaze upon the miserable goree was the orb of day he peered through the uncurtained window first deluging the sleeper in a flood of faint gold but soon pouring upon the mottled red of his flesh a searching white summer heat goree stirred half unconsciously among the table s d bris and turned his face from the window his movement dislodged a heavy law book which crashed upon the floor opening his eyes he saw bending over him a man in a black frock coat looking higher he discovered a well worn silk hat and beneath it the kindly smooth face of colonel abner coltrane a little uncertain of the outcome the colonel waited for the other to make some sign of recognition not in twenty years had male members of these two families faced each other in peace goree s eyelids puckered as he strained his blurred sight toward this visitor and then he smiled serenely have you brought stella and lucy over to play he said calmly do you know me yancey asked coltrane of course i do you brought me a whip with a whistle in the end so he had twenty four years ago when yancey s father was his best friend goree s eyes wandered about the room the colonel understood lie still and i ll bring you some said he there was a pump in the yard at the rear and goree closed his eyes listening with rapture to the click of its handle and the bubbling of the falling stream col trane brought a pitcher of the cool water and held it for him to drink presently goree sat up a most forlorn object his summer suit of flax soiled and crumpled his discreditable head tousled and unsteady he tried to wave one of his hands toward the colonel ex excuse everything will you he said i must have drunk too much whiskey last night and gone to bed on the table his brows knitted into a puzzled frown out with the boys awhile asked coltrane kindly no i went nowhere i haven t had a dollar to spend in the last two months struck the demijohn too often i reckon as usual colonel coltrane touched him on the shoulder a little while ago yancey he began you asked me if i had brought stella and lucy over to play you weren t quite awake then and must have been dreaming you were a boy again you are awake now and i want you to listen to me i have come from stella and lucy to their old playmate and to my old friend s son they know that i am going to bring you home with me and you will find them as ready with a welcome as they were in the old days i want you to come to my house and stay until you are yourself aain and as much longer as you will we heard of your being down in the world and in the midst of temptation and we agreed that you should come over and play at our house once more will you come my boy will you drop our old family trouble and come with me trouble said goree opening his eyes wide there was never any trouble between us that i know of i m sure we ve always been the best friends but good lord colonel how could i go to your home as i am a drunken wretch a miserable degraded spendthrift and gambler he lurched from the table into his armchair and began to weep maudlin tears mingled with genuine drops of remorse and shame coltrane talked to him persist ently and reasonably reminding him of the simple moun tain pleasures of which he had once been so fond and insisting upon the genuineness of the invitation finally he landed goree by telling him he was counting upon his help in the engineering and transportation of a large amount of felled timber from a high mountain side to a waterway he knew that goree had once invented a device for this purpose a series of slides and chutes upon which he had justly prided himself in an instant the poor fellow delighted at the idea of his being of use to any one had paper spread upon the table and was drawing rapid but pitifully shaky lines in demonstration of what he could and would do the man was sickened of the husks his prodigal heart was turning again toward the mountains his mind was yet strangely clogged and his thoughts and memories were returning to his brain one by one like carrier pigeons over a stormy sea but coltrane was satisfied with the progress he had made bethel received the surprise of its existence that after noon when a coltrane and a goree rode amicably together through the town side by side they rode out from the dusty streets and gaping townspeople down across the creek bridge and up toward the mountain the prodigal had brushed and washed and combed himself to a more decent figure but he was unsteady in the saddle and he seemed to be deep in the contemplation of some vexing problem coltrane left him in his mood relying upon the influence of changed surroundings to restore his equilibrium once goree was seized with a shaking fit and almost came to a collapse he had to dismount and rest at the side of the road the colonel foreseeing such a con dition had provided a small flask of whisky for the journey but when it was offered to him goree refused it almost with violence declaring he would never touch it again by and by he was recovered and went quietly enough for a mile or two then he pulled up his horse suddenly and said i lost two hundred dollars last night playing poker now where did i get that money take it easy yancev the mountain air will soon clear it up we ll go fishing first thing at the pinnacle falls the trout are jumping there like bullfrogs we ll take stella and lucy along and have a picnic on eagle rock have you forgotten how a hickory cured ham sandwich tastes yancey to a hungry fisherman evidently the colonel did not believe the story of his lost wealth so goree retired again into brooding silence by late afternoon they had travelled ten of the twelve miles between bethel and laurel half a mile this side of laurel lay the old goree place a mile or two beyond the village lived the coltranes the road was now steep and laborious but the compensations were many the tilted aisles of the forest were opulent with leaf and bird and bloom the tonic air put to shame the pharma cop ia the glades were dark with mossy shade and bright with shy rivulets winking from the ferns and laurels on the lower side they viewed framed in the near foilage exquisite sketches of the far valley swooning in its opal haze coltrane was pleased to see that his companion was yielding to the spell of the hills and woods for now they had but to skirt the base of painter s cliff to cross elder branch and mount the hill beyond and goree would have to face the squandered home of his fathers every rock he passed every tree every foot of the rocky way was familiar to him though he hid forgotten the woods they thrilled him like the music of home sweet home they rounded the cliff decended into elder branch and paused there to let the horses drink and splash in the swift water on the right was a rail fence that cornered there and followed the road and stream inclosed by it was the old apple orchard of the home place the house was yet concealed by the brow of the steep hill inside and along the fence pokeberries elders sassafras and sumac grew high and dense at a rustle of their branches both goree and coltrane glanced up and saw a long yellow wolfish face above the fence staring at them with pale unwinking eyes the head quicky disappeared there was a violent swaying of the bushes and an ungainly figure ran up through the apple orchard in the direction of the house zigzagging among the trees that s garvey said coltrane the man you sold out to there s no doubt but he s considerably cracked i had to send him up for moonshining once several years ago in spite of the fact that i believed him irresponsible why what s the matter yancey goree was wiping his forehead and his face had lost its colour do i look queer too he asked trying to smile i m just remembering a few more things some of the alcohol had evaporated from his brain i recollect now where i got that two hundred dollars don t think of it said coltrane cheerfully later on we ll figure it all out together they rode out of the branch and when they reached the foot of the hill goree stopped again did you ever suspect i was a very vain kind of fellow colonel he asked sort of foolish proud about appearances the colonel s eyes refused to wander to the soiled sag ging suit of flax and the faded slouch hat it seems to me he replied mystified but humouring him i remember a young buck about twenty with the tightest coat the sleekest hair and the prancingest saddle horse in the blue ridge right you are said goree eagerly and it s in me yet though it don t show oh i m as vain as a turkey gobbler and as proud as lucifer i m going to ask you to indulge this weakness of mine in a little matter speak out yancey we ll create you duke of laurel and baron of blue ridge if you choose and you shall have a feather out of stella s peacock s tail to wear in your hat i m in earnest in a few minutes we ll pass the house up there on the hill where i was born and where my people have lived for nearly a century strangers live there now and look at me i am about to show myself to them ragged and poverty stricken a wastrel and a beggar colonel coltrane i m ashamed to do it i want you to let me wear your coat and hat until we are out of sight beyond i know you think it a foolish pride but i want to make as good a showing as i can when i pass the old place now what does this mean said coltrane to him self as he compared his companion s sane looks and quiet demeanour with his strange request but he was already unbuttoning the coat assenting readily as if the fancy were in no wise to be considered strange the coat and hat fitted goree well he buttoned the former about him with a look of satisfaction and dignity he and coltrane were nearly the same size rather tall portly and erect twenty five years were between them but in appearance they might have been brothers goree looked older than his age his face was puffy and lined the colonel had the smooth fresh complexion of a temperate liver he put on goree s disreputable old flax coat and faded slouch hat now said goree taking up the reins i m all right i want you to ride about ten feet in the rear as we go by colonel so that they can get a good look at me they ll see i m no back number yet by any means i guess i ll show up pretty well to them once more any how let s ride on he set out up the hill at a smart trot the colonel fol lowing as he had been requested goree sat straight in the saddle with head erect but his eyes were turned to the right sharply scanning every shrub and fence and hiding place in the old homestead yard once he muttered to himself will the crazy fool try it or did i dream half of it it was when he came opposite the little family burying ground that he saw what he had been looking for a puff of white smoke coming from the thick cedars in one comer he toppled so slowly to the left that coltrane had time to urge his horse to that side and catch him with one arm the squirrel hunter had not overpraised his aim he had sent the bullet where he intended and where goree had expected that it would pass through the breast of colonel abner coltrane s black frock coat goree leaned heavily against coltrane but he did not fall the horses kept pace side by side and the colonel s arm kept him steady the little white houses of laurel shone through the trees half a mile away goree reached out one hand and groped until it rested upon coltrane s fingers which held his bridle good friend he said and that was all thus did yancey goree as be rode past his old home make considering all things the best showing that was in his power the song and the sergeant half a dozen people supping at a table in one of the upper broadway all night restaurants were making too much noise three times the manager walked past them with a politely warning glance but their argument had waxed too warm to be quelled by a manager s gaze it was midnight and the restaurant was filled with patrons from the theatres of that district some among the dispersed audiences must have recognized among the quarrelsome sextet the faces of the players belonging to the carroll comedy company four of the six made up the company another was the author of the comedietta a gay coquette which the quartette of layers had been presenting with fair success at several vaudeville houses in the city the sixth at the table was a person inconsequent in the realm of art but one at whose bidding many lobsters had perished loudly the six maintained their clamorous debate no one of the party was silent except when answers were stormed from him by the excited ones that was the comedian of a gay coquette he was a young man with a face even too melancholy for his profession the oral warfare of four immoderate tongues was directed at miss clarice carroll the twinkling star of the small aggregation excepting the downcast comedian all members of the party united in casting upon her with vehemence the blame of some momentous misfortune fifty times they told her it is your fault clarice it is you alone who spoilt the scene it is only of late that you have acted this way at this rate the sketch will have to be taken off miss carroll was a match for any four gallic ancestry gave her a vivacity that could easily mount to fury her large eyes flashed a scorching denial at her accusers her slender eloquent arms constantly menaced the tableware her high clear soprano voice rose to what would have been a scream had it not possessed so pure a musical quality she hurled back at the attacking four their denunciations in tones sweet but of too great carrying power for a broadway restaurant finally they exhausted her patience both as a woman and an artist she sprang up like a panther managed to smash half a dozen plates and glasses with one royal sweep of her arm and defied her critics they rose and wrangled more loudly the comedian sighed and looked a trifle sadder and disinterested the manager came tripping and suggested peace he was told to go to the popular synonym for war so promptly that the affair might have happened at the hague thus was the manager angered he made a sign with his hand and a waiter slipped out of the door in twenty minutes the party of six was in a police station facing a grizzled and philosophical desk sergeant disorderly conduct in a restaurant said the police man who had brought the party in the author of a gay coquette stepped to the front he wore nose glasses and evening clothes even if his shoes had been tans before they met the patent leather polish bottle mr sergeant said he out of his throat like actor irving i would like to protest against this arrest the company of actors who are performing in a little play that i have written in company with a friend and myself were having a little supper we became deeply interested in the discussion as to which one of the cast is responsible for a scene in the sketch that lately has fallen so flat that the piece is about to become a failure we may have been rather noisy and intolerant of interruption by the restaurant people but the matter was of considerable importance to all of us you see that we are sober and are not the kind of people who desire to raise disturbances i hope that the case will not be pressed and that we may be allowed to go who makes the charge asked the sergeant me said a white aproned voice in the rear de restaurant sent me to de gang was raisin a rough house and breakin dishes the dishes were paid for said the playwright they were not broken purposely in her anger because we remonstrated with her for spoiling the scene miss it s not true sergeant cried the clear voice of miss clarice carroll in a long coat of tan silk and a red plumed hat she bounded before the desk it s not my fault she cried indignantly how dare they say such a thing i ve played the title r le ever since it was staged and if you want to know who made it a success ask the public that s all what miss carroll says is true in part said the author for five months the comedietta was a drawing card in the best houses but during the last two weeks it has lost favour there is one scene in it in which miss carroll made a big hit now she hardly gets a hand out of it she spoils it by acting it entirely different from her old way it is not my fault reiterated the actress there are only two of you on in the scene argued the playwright hotly you and delmars here then it s his fault declared miss carroll with a lightning glance of scorn from her dark eyes the comedian caught it and gazed with increased melancholy at the panels of the sergeant s desk the night was a dull one in that particular police station the sergeant s long blunted curiosity awoke a little i ve heard you he said to the author and then he addressed the thin faced and ascetic looking lady of the company who played aunt turnip top in the little comedy who do you think spoils the scene you are fussing about he asked i m no knocker said that lady and everybody knows it so when i say that clarice falls down every time in that scene i m judging her art and not herself she was great in it once she does it something fierce now it ll dope the show if she keeps it up the sergeant looked at the comedian you and the lady have this scene together i under stand i suppose there s no use asking you which one of you queers it the comedian avoided the direct rays from the two fixed stars of miss carroll s eyes i don t know he said looking down at his patent leather toes are you one of the actors asked the sergeant of a dwarfish youth with a middle aged face why say replied the last thespian witness you don t notice any tin spear in my hands do you you haven t heard me shout see the emperor comes since i ve been in here have you i guess i m on the stage long enough for em not to start a panic by mistaking me for a thin curl of smoke rising above the footlights in your opinion if you ve got one said the sergeant is the frost that gathers on the scene in question the work of the lady or the gentleman who takes part in it the middle aged youth looked pained i regret to say he answered that miss carroll seems to have lost her grip on that scene she s all right in the rest of the play but but i tell you sergeant she can do it she has done it equal to any of em and she can do it again miss carroll ran forward glowing and palpitating thank you jimmy for the first good word i ve had in many a day she cried and then she turned her eager face toward the desk i ll show you sergeant whether i am to blame i ll show them whether i can do that same come mr delmars let us begin you will let us won t you sergeant how long will it take asked the sergeant dubiously eight minutes said the playwright the entire play consumes but thirty you may go ahead said the sergeant most of you seem to side against the little lady maybe she had a right to crack up a saucer or two in that restaurant we ll see how she does the turn before we take that up the matron of the police station had been standing near listening to the singular argument she came nigher and stood near the sergeant s chair two or three of the reserves strolled in big and yawning before beginning the scene said the playwright and assuming that you have not seen a production of a gay coquette i will make a brief but necessary explanation it is a musical farce comedy burlesque comedietta as the title implies miss carroll s r le is that of a gay rollicking mischievous heartless coquette she sustains that character throughout the entire comedy part of the production and i have designed the extravaganza features so that she may preserve and present the same coquettish idea now the scene in which we take exception to miss carroll s acting is called the gorilla dance she is costumed to represent a wood nymph and there is a great song and dance scene with a gorilla played by mr delmars the comedian a tropical forest stage is set that used to get four and five recalls the main thing was the acting and the dance it was the funniest thing in new york for five months delmars s song i ll woo thee to my sylvan home while he and miss carroll were cutting hide and seek capers among the tropical plants was a winner what s the trouble with the scene now asked the sergeant miss carroll spoils it right in the middle of it said the playwright wrathfully with a wide gesture of her ever moving arms the actress waved back the little group of spectators leaving a space in front of the desk for the scene of her vindication or fall then she whipped off her long tan cloak and tossed it across the arm of the policeman who still stood officially among them miss carroll had gone to supper well cloaked but in the costume of the tropic wood nymph a skirt of fern leaves touched her knee she was like a humming bird green and golden and purple and then she danced a fluttering fantastic dance so agile and light and mazy in her steps that the other three members of the carroll comedy company broke into applause at the art of it and at the proper time delmars leaped out at her side mimicking the uncouth hideous bounds of the gorilla so funnily that the grizzled sergeant himself gave a short laugh like the closing of a padlock they danced together the gorilla dance and won a hand from all then began the most fantastic part of the scene the wooing of the nymph by the gorilla it was a kind of dance itself eccentric and prankish with the nymph coquettish and seductive retreat followed by the gorilla as he sang i ll woo thee to my sylvan home the song was a lyric of merit the words were non sense as befitted the play but the music was worthy of something better delmars struck into it in a rich tenor that owned a quality that shamed the flippant words during one verse of the song the wood nymph per formed the grotesque evolutions designed for the scene at the middle of the second verse she stood still with a strange look on her face seeming to gaze dreamily into the depths of the scenic forest the gorilla s last leap had brought him to her feet and there he knelt holding her hand until he had finished the haunting lyric that was set in the absurd comedy like a diamond in a piece of putty when delmars ceased miss carroll started and covered a sudden flow of tears with both hands there cried the playwright gesticulating with violence there you have it sergeant for two weeks she has spoiled that scene in just that manner at every performance i have begged her to consider that it is not ophelia or juliet that she is playing do you wonder now at our impatience tears for the gorilla song the play is lost out of her bewitchment whatever it was the wood nymph flared suddenly and pointed a desperate finger at delmars it is you you who have done this she cried wildly you never sang that song that way until lately it is your doing i give it up said the sergeant and then the gray haired matron of the police station came forward from behind the sergeant s chair must an old woman teach you all she said she went up to miss carroll and took her hand the man s wearing his heart out for you my dear couldn t you tell it the first note you heard him sing all of his monkey flip flops wouldn t have kept it from me must you be deaf as well as blind that s why you couldn t act your part child do you love him or must he be a gorilla for the rest of his days miss carroll whirled around and caught delmars with a lightning glance of her eye he came toward her melancholy did you hear mr delmars she asked with a catching breath i did said the comedian it is true i didn t think there was any use i tried to let you know with the song silly said the matron why didn t you speak no no cried the wood nymph his way was the best i didn t know but it was just what i wanted bobby she sprang like a green grasshopper and the comedian opened his arms and smiled get out of this roared the desk sergeant to the waiting waiter from the restaurant there s nothing doing here for you one dollar s worth the judge of the united states court of the district lying along the rio grande border found the following letter one morning in his mail judge when you sent me up for four years you made a talk among other hard things you called me a rattlesnake maybe i am one anyhow you hear me rattling now one year after i got to the pen my daughter died of well they said it was poverty and the disgrace together you ve got a daughter judge and i m going to make you know how it feels to lose one and i m going to bite that district attorney that spoke against me i m free now and i guess i ve turned to rattlesnake all right i feel like one i don t say much but this is my rattle look out when i strike yours respectfully rattlesnake judge derwent threw the letter carelessly aside it was nothing new to receive such epistles from desperate men whom he had been called upon to judge he felt no alarm later on he showed the letter to littlefield the young district attorney for littlefield s name was included in the threat and the judge was punctilious in matters between himself and his fellow men littlefield honoured the rattle of the writer as far as it concerned himself with a smile of contempt but he frowned a little over the reference to the judge s daughter for he and nancy derwent were to be married in the fall littlefield went to the clerk of the court and looked over the records with him they decided that the letter might have been sent by mexico sam a half breed border desperado who had been imprisoned for manslaughter four years before then official duties crowded the mat ter from his mind and the rattle of the revengeful serpent was forgotten court was in session at brownsville most of the cases to be tried were charges of smuggling counterfeiting post office robberies and violations of federal laws along the border one case was that of a young mexican rafael ortiz who had been rounded up by a clever deputy marshal in the act of passing a counterfeit silver dollar he had been suspected of many such deviations from rectitude but this was the first time that anything provable had been fixed upon him ortiz languished cozily in jail smoking brown cigarettes and waiting for trial kilpatrick the deputy brought the counterfeit dollar and handed it to the district attorney in his office in the court house the deputy and a reputable druggist were prepared to swear that ortiz paid for a bottle of medicine with it the coin was a poor counterfeit soft dull looking and made principally of lead it was the day before the morning on which the docket would reach the case of ortiz and the district attorney was preparing himself for trial not much need of having in high priced experts to prove the coin s queer is there kil smiled littlefield as he thumped the dollar down upon the table where it fell with no more ring than would have come from a lump of putty i guess the greaser s as good as behind the bars said the deputy easing up his holsters you ve got him dead if it had been just one time these mexicans can t tell good money from bad but this little yaller rascal belongs to a gang of counterfeiters i know this is the first time i ve been able to catch him doing the trick he s got a girl down there in them mexican jacals on the river bank i seen her one day when i was watching him she s as pretty as a red heifer in a flower bed littlefield shoved the counterfeit dollar into his pocket and slipped his memoranda of the case into an envelope just then a bright winsome face as frank and jolly as a boy s appeared in the doorway and in walked nancy derwent oh bob didn t court adjourn at twelve to day until to morrow she asked of littlefield it did said the district attorney and i m very glad of it i ve got a lot of rulings to look up and now that s just like you i wonder you and father don t turn to law books or rulings or something i want you to take me out plover shooting this afternoon long prairie is just alive with them don t say no please i want to try my new twelve bore hammerless i ve sent to the livery stable to engage fly and bess for the buckboard they stand fire so nicely i was sure you would go they were to be married in the fall the glamour was at its height the plovers won the day or rather the afternoon over the calf bound authorities littlefield began to put his papers away there was a knock at the door kilpatrick answered it a beautiful dark eyed girl with a skin tinged with the faintest lemon colour walked into the room a black shawl was thrown over her head and wound once around her neck she began to talk in spanish a voluble mournful stream of melancholy music littlefield did not under stand spanish the deputy did and he translated her talk by portions at intervals holding up his hand to check the flow of her words she came to see you mr littlefield her name s joya trevi as she wants to see you about well she s mixed up with that rafael ortiz she s his she s his girl she says he s innocent she says she made the money and got him to pass it don t you believe her mr little field that s the way with these mexi can girls they ll lie steal or kill for a fellow when they get stuck on him never trust a woman that s in love mr kilpatrick nancy derwent s indignant exclamation caused the deputy to flounder for a moment in attempting to explain that he had misquoted his own sentiments and then he event on with the translation she says she s willing to take his place in the jail if you ll let him out she says she was down sick with the fever and the doctor said she d die if she didn t have medicine that s why he passed the lead dollar on the drug store she says it saved her life this rafal seems to be her honey all right there s a lot of stuff in her talk about love and such things that you don t want to hear it was an old story to the district attorney tell her said he that i can do nothing the case comes up in the morning and he will have to make his fight before the court nancy derwent was not so hardened she was look ing with sympathetic interest at joya trevi as and at littlefield alternately the deputy repeated the dis trict attorney s words to the girl she spoke a sentence or two in a low voice pulled her shawl closely about her face and left the room what did she say then asked the district attorney nothing special said the deputy she said if the life of the one let s see how it went si la vida de ella a quien tu amas if the life of the girl you love is ever in danger remember rafael ortiz kilpatrick strolled out through the corridor in the direction of the marshal s office can t you do anything for them bob asked nancy it s such a little thing just one counterfeit dollar to ruin the happiness of two lives she was in danger of death and he did it to save her doesn t the law know the feeling of pity it hasn t a place in jurisprudence nan said little field especially in re the district attorney s duty i ll promise you that the prosecution will not be vindictive but the man is as good as convicted when the case is called witnesses will swear to his passing the bad dollar which i have in my pocket at this moment as exhibit a there are no mexicans on the jury and it will vote mr greaser guilty without leaving the box the plover shooting was fine that afternoon and in the excitement of the sport the case of rafael and the grief of joya trevi as was forgotten the district attor ney and nancy derwent drove out from the town three miles along a smooth grassy road and then struck across a rolling prairie toward a heavy line of timber on piedra creek beyond this creek lay long prairie the favourite haunt of the plover as they were nearing the creek they heard the galloping of a horse to their right and saw a man with black hair and a swarthy face riding toward the woods at a tangent as if he had come up behind them i ve seen that fellow somewhere said littlefield who had a memory for faces but i can t exactly place him some ranchman i suppose taking a short cut home they spent an hour on long prairie shooting from the buckboard nancy derwent an active outdoor western girl was pleased with her twelve bore she had bagged within two brace of her companion s score they started homeward at a gentle trot when within a hundred yards of piedra creek a man rode out of the timber directly toward them it looks like the man we saw coming over remarked miss derwent as the distance between them lessened the district attorney suddenly pulled up his team sharply with his eyes fixed upon the advancing horseman that individ ual had drawn a winchester from its scabbard on his saddle and thrown it over his arm now i know you mexico sam muttered littlefield to himself it was you who shook your rattles in that gentle epistle mexico sam did not leave things long in doubt he had a nice eye in all matters relating to firearms so when he was within good rifle range but outside of danger from no shot he threw up his winchester and opened fire upon the occupants of the buckboard the first shot cracked the back of the seat within the two inch space between the shoulders of littlefield and miss derwent the next went through the dashboard and littlefield s trouser leg the district attorney hustled nancy out of the buck board to the ground she was a little pale but asked no questions she had the frontier instinct that accepts conditions in an emergency without superfluous argument they kept their guns in hand and littlefield hastily gathered some handfuls of cartridges from the pasteboard box on the seat and crowded them into his pockets keep behind the horses nan he commanded that fellow is a ruffian i sent to prison once he s trying to get even he knows our shot won t hurt

we explored every side top circumference mean elevation angle slope and concavity of every one for two miles up and down the river we spent four days doing so then we hitched up the roan and the dun and hauled the remains of the coffee and bacon the one hundred and forty nine miles back to concho city lee rundle chewed much tobacco on the return trip i was busy driving because i was in a hurry as shortly as could be after our empty return goodloe banks and i forgathered in the back room of snyder s saloon to play dominoes and fish for information i told goodloe about my expedition after the buried treasure if i could have found that three hundred thousand dollars i said to him i could have scoured and sifted the surface of the earth to find may martha mangum she is meant for higher things said goodloe i shall find her myself but tell me how you went about discovering the spot where this unearthed increment was imprudently buried i told him in the smallest detail i showed him the draughtsman s sketch with the distances marked plainly upon it after glancing over it in a masterly way he leaned back in his chair and bestowed upon me an explosion of sardonic superior collegiate laughter well you are a fool jim he said when he could speak it s your play said i patiently fingering my double six twenty said goodloe making two crosses on the table with his chalk why am i a fool i asked buried treasure has been found before in many places because said he in calculating the point on the river where your line would strike you neglected to allow for the variation the variation there would be nine degrees west let me have your pencil goodloe banks figured rapidly on the back of an envelope the distance from north to south of the line run from the spanish mission said he is exactly twenty two miles it was run by a pocket compass according to your story allowing for the variation the point on the alamito river where you should have searched for your treasure is exactly six miles and nine hundred and forty five varas farther west than the place you hit upon oh what a fool you are jim what is this variation that you speak of i asked i thought figures never lied the variation of the magnetic compass said goodloe from the true meridian he smiled in his superior way and then i saw come out in his face the singular eager consuming cupidity of the seeker after buried treasure sometimes he said with the air of the oracle these old traditions of hidden money are not without foundation suppose you let me look over that paper describing the location perhaps together we might the result was that goodloe banks and i rivals in love became companions in adventure we went to chico by stage from huntersburg the nearest railroad town in chico we hired a team drawing a covered spring wagon and camping paraphernalia we had the same surveyor run out our distance as revised by goodloe and his variations and then dismissed him and sent him on his homeward road it was night when we arrived i fed the horses and made a fire near the bank of the river and cooked supper goodloe would have helped but his education had not fitted him for practical things but while i worked he cheered me with the expression of great thoughts handed down from the dead ones of old he quoted some translations from the greek at much length anacreon he explained that was a favorite passage with miss mangum as i recited it she is meant for higher things said i repeating his phrase can there be anything higher asked goodloe than to dwell in the society of the classics to live in the atmosphere of learning and culture you have often decried education what of your wasted efforts through your ignorance of simple mathematics how soon would you have found your treasure if my knowledge had not shown you your error we ll take a look at those hills across the river first said i and see what we find i am still doubtful about variations i have been brought up to believe that the needle is true to the pole the next morning was a bright june one we were up early and had breakfast goodloe was charmed he recited keats i think it was and kelly or shelley while i broiled the bacon we were getting ready to cross the river which was little more than a shallow creek there and explore the many sharp peaked cedar covered hills on the other side my good ulysses said goodloe slapping me on the shoulder while i was washing the tin breakfast plates let me see the enchanted document once more i believe it gives directions for climbing the hill shaped like a pack saddle i never saw a pack saddle what is it like jim score one against culture said i i ll know it when i see it goodloe was looking at old rundle s document when he ripped out a most uncollegiate swear word come here he said holding the paper up against the sunlight look at that he said laying his finger against it on the blue paper a thing i had never noticed before i saw stand out in white letters the word and figures malvern what about it i asked it s the water mark said goodloe the paper was manufactured in the writing on the paper is dated this is a palpable fraud oh i don t know said i the rundles are pretty reliable plain uneducated country people maybe the paper manufacturers tried to perpetrate a swindle and then goodloe banks went as wild as his education permitted he dropped the glasses

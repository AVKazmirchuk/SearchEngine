the back room for half an hour with o connor and the interpreter i noticed that when they went in they were always smoking eight inch cigars and at peace with the world but when they came out they would be folding up a ten or twenty dollar bill and cursing the government horribly one evening after we had been in guaya in this town of smellville by the sea about a month and me and o connor were sitting outside the door helping along old tempus fugit with rum and ice and limes i says to him if you ll excuse a patriot that don t exactly know what he s patronizing for the question what is your scheme for subjugating this country do you intend to plunge it into bloodshed or do you mean to buy its votes peacefully and honorably at the polls bowers says he ye re a fine little man and i intend to make great use of ye after the conflict but ye do not understand statecraft already by now we have a network of strategy clutching with invisible fingers at the throat of the tyrant calderas we have agents at work in every town in the republic the liberal party is bound to win on our secret lists we have the names of enough sympathizers to crush the administration forces at a single blow a straw vote says i only shows which way the hot air blows who has accomplished this goes on o connor i have i have directed everything the time was ripe when we came so my agents inform me the people are groaning under burdens of taxes and levies who will be their natural leader when they rise could it be any one but meself twas only yesterday that zaldas our representative in the province of durasnas tells me that the people in secret already call me el library door which is the spanish manner of saying the liberator was zaldas that maroon colored old aztec with a paper collar on and unbleached domestic shoes i asked he was says o connor i saw him tucking a yellow back into his vest pocket as he came out says i it may be says i that they call you a library door but they treat you more like the side door of a bank but let us hope for the worst it has cost money of course says o connor but we ll have the country in our hands inside of a month in the evenings we walked about in the plaza and listened to the band playing and mingled with the populace at its distressing and obnoxious pleasures there were thirteen vehicles belonging to the upper classes mostly rockaways and old style barouches such as the mayor rides in at the unveiling of the new poorhouse at milledgeville alabama round and round the desiccated fountain in the middle of the plaza they drove and lifted their high silk hats to their friends the common people walked around in barefooted bunches puffing stogies that a pittsburg millionaire wouldn t have chewed for a dry smoke on ladies day at his club and the grandest figure in the whole turnout was barney o connor six foot two he stood in his fifth avenue clothes with his eagle eye and his black moustache that tickled his ears he was a born dictator and czar and hero and harrier of the human race it looked to me that all eyes were turned upon o connor and that every woman there loved him and every man feared him once or twice i looked at him and thought of funnier things that had happened than his winning out in his game and i began to feel like a hidalgo de officio de grafto de south america myself and then i would come down again to solid

when they look unhappy they re enjoying themselves when they feel unhappy they go to sleep they re not the kind of people to take an interest in revolutions they ll flock to our standard says o connor three thousand men in this town alone will spring to arms when the signal is given i am assured of that but everything is in secret there is no chance for us to fail on hooligan alley as i prefer to call the street our headquarters was on there was a row of flat dobe houses with red tile roofs some straw shacks full of indians and dogs and one two story wooden house with balconies a little farther down that was where general tumbalo the comandante and commander of the military forces lived right across the street was a private residence built like a combination bake oven and folding bed one day o connor and me were passing it single file on the flange they called a sidewalk when out of the window flies a big red rose o connor who is ahead picks it up presses it to his fifth rib and bows to the ground by carrambos that man certainly had the irish drama chaunceyized i looked around expecting to see the little boy and girl in white sateen ready to jump on his shoulder while he jolted their spinal columns and ribs together through a breakdown and sang sleep little one sleep as i passed the window i glanced inside and caught a glimpse of a white dress and a pair of big flashing black eyes and gleaming teeth under a dark

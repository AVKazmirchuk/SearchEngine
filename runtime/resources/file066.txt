the crouching form of the mexican lion his amber eyeballs glared hungrily six feet from them was the tip of the tail stretched straight like a pointer s his hind quarters rocked with the motion of the cat tribe preliminary to leaping givens did what he could his six shooter was thirty five yards away lying on the grass he gave a loud yell and dashed between the lion and the princess the rucus as givens called it afterward was brief and somewhat confused when he arrived on the line of attack he saw a dim streak in the air and heard a couple of faint cracks then a hundred pounds of mexican lion plumped down upon his head and flattened him with a heavy jar to the ground he remembered calling out let up now no fair gouging and then he crawled from under the lion like a worm with his mouth full of grass and dirt and a big lump on the back of his head where it had struck the root of a water elm the lion lay motionless givens feeling aggrieved and suspicious of fouls shook his fist at the lion and shouted i ll rastle you again for twenty and then he got back to himself josefa was standing in her tracks quietly reloading her silver mounted it had not been a difficult shot the lion s head made an easier mark than a tomato can swinging at the end of a string there was a provoking teasing maddening smile upon her mouth and in her dark eyes the would be rescuing knight felt the fire of his fiasco burn down to his soul here had been his chance the chance that he had dreamed of and momus and not cupid had presided over it the satyrs in the wood were no doubt holding their sides in hilarious silent laughter there had been something like vaudeville say signor givens and his funny knockabout act with the stuffed lion is that you mr givens said josefa in her deliberate saccharine contralto you nearly spoilt my shot when you yelled did you hurt your head when you fell oh no said givens quietly that didn t hurt he stooped ignominiously and dragged his best stetson hat from under the beast it was crushed and wrinkled to a fine comedy effect then he knelt down and softly stroked the fierce open jawed head of the dead lion poor old bill he exclaimed mournfully what s that asked josefa sharply of course you didn t know miss josefa said givens with an air of one allowing magnanimity to triumph over grief nobody can blame you i tried to save him but i couldn t let you know in time save who why bill i ve been looking for him all day you see he s been our camp pet for two years poor old fellow he wouldn t have hurt a cottontail rabbit it ll break the boys all up when they hear about it but you couldn t tell of course that bill was just trying to play with you josefa s black eyes burned steadily upon him ripley givens met the test successfully he stood rumpling the yellow brown curls on his head pensively in his eye was regret not unmingled with a gentle reproach his smooth features were set to a pattern of indisputable sorrow josefa wavered what was your pet doing here she asked making a last stand there s no camp near the white horse crossing the old rascal ran away from camp yesterday answered givens readily it s a wonder the coyotes didn t scare him to death you see jim webster our horse wrangler brought a little terrier pup into camp last week the pup made life miserable for bill he used to chase him around and chew his hind legs for hours at a time every night when bedtime came bill would sneak under one of the boy s blankets and sleep to keep the pup from finding him i reckon he must have been worried pretty desperate or he wouldn t have run away he was always afraid to get out of sight of camp josefa looked at the body of the fierce animal givens gently patted one of the formidable paws that could have killed a yearling calf with one blow slowly a red flush widened upon the dark olive face of the girl was it the signal of shame of the true sportsman who has brought down ignoble quarry her eyes grew softer and the lowered lids drove away all their bright mockery i m very sorry she said humbly but he looked so big and jumped so high that poor old bill was hungry interrupted givens in quick defence of the deceased we always made him jump for his supper in camp he would lie down and roll over for a piece of meat when he saw you he thought he was going to get something to eat from you suddenly josefa s eyes opened wide i might have shot you she exclaimed you ran right in between you risked your life to save your pet that was fine mr givens i like a man who is kind to animals yes there was even admiration in her gaze

we seemed to like to be together if he ever had slapped me on the back and snivelled over me like i ve seen men do to what they called their friends i know i d have had a rough and tumble with him on the spot same way with george he hated my ways as bad as i did his when we were mining we lived in separate tents so as not to intrude our obnoxiousness on each other but after a long time we begun to know each of us could depend on the other when we were in a pinch up to his last dollar word of honor or perjury bullet or drop of blood we had in the world we never even spoke of it to each other because that would have spoiled it but we tried it out time after time until we came to know i ve grabbed my hat and jumped a freight and rode miles to identify him when he was about to be hung by mistake in idaho for a train robber once i laid sick of typhoid in a tent in texas without a dollar or a change of clothes and sent for george in boise city he came on the next train the first thing he did before speaking to me was to hang up a little looking glass on the side of the tent and curl his moustache and rub some hair dye on his head his hair is naturally a light reddish then he gave me the most scientific cussing i ever had and took off his coat if you wasn t a moses meek little mary s lamb you wouldn t have been took down this way says he haven t you got gumption enough not to drink swamp water or fall down and scream whenever you have a little colic or feel a mosquito bite you he made me a little mad you ve got the bedside manners of a piute medicine man says i and i wish you d go away and let me die a natural death i m sorry i sent for you i ve a mind to says george for nobody cares whether you live or die but now i ve been tricked into coming i might as well stay until this little attack of indigestion or nettle rash or whatever it is passes away two weeks afterward when i was beginning to get around again the doctor laughed and said he was sure that my friend s keeping me mad all the time did more than his drugs to cure me so that s the way george and me was friends there wasn t any sentiment about it it was just give and take and each of us knew that the other was ready for the call at any time i remember once i played a sort of joke on george just to try him i felt a little mean about it afterward because i never ought to have doubted he d do it we was both living in a little town in the san luis valley running some flocks of sheep and a few cattle we were partners but as usual we didn t live together i had an old aunt out from the east visiting for the summer so i rented a little cottage she soon had a couple of cows and some pigs and chickens to make the place look like home george lived alone in a little cabin half a mile out of town one day a calf that we had died that night i broke its bones dumped it into a coarse sack and tied it up with wire i put on an old shirt tore a sleeve most out of it and the collar half off tangled up my hair put some red ink on my hands and spashed some of it over my shirt and face i must have looked like i d been having the fight of my life i put the sack in a wagon and drove out to george s cabin when i halloed he came out in a yellow dressing gown a turkish cap and patent leather shoes george always was a great dresser i dumped the bundle to the ground sh sh says i kind of wild in my way take that and bury it george out somewhere behind your house bury it just like it is and don don t get excited says george and for the lord s sake go and wash your hands and face and put on a clean shirt and he lights his pipe while i drive away at a gallop the next morning he drops around to our cottage where my aunt was fiddling with her flowers and truck in the front yard he bends himself and bows and makes compliments as be could do when so disposed and begs a rose bush from her saying he had turned up a little land back of his cabin and wanted to plant something on it by way of usefulness and ornament so my aunt flattered pulls up one of her biggest by the roots and gives it to him afterward i see it growing where he planted it in a place where the grass had been cleared off and the dirt levelled but neither george nor me ever spoke of it to each other again the moon rose higher possibly drawing water from the sea pixies from their dells and certainly more confidences from simms bell the friend of a friend there come a time not long afterward he went on when i was able to do a good turn for george ringo george had made a little pile of money in beeves and he was up in denver and he showed up when i saw him wearing deer skin vests yellow shoes clothes like the awnings in front of drug stores and

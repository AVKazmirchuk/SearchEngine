interrupted the passenger who was nobody in particular if you could put up a windmill on every one of them wells you re using you d be able to retire from business wouldn t you the windmill man grinned good naturedly oh i ain t no guy de mopassong he said cheerfully i m giving it to you in straight american well she says something like this mr gold bonds is only a friend says she but he takes me riding and buys me theatre tickets and that s what you never do ain t i to never have any pleasure in life while i can pass this chatfield chatfield thing along says redruth hand out the mitt to the willie with creases in it or you don t put your slippers under my wardrobe now that kind of train orders don t go with a girl that s got any spirit i bet that girl loved her honey all the time maybe she only wanted as girls do to work the good thing for a little fun and caramels before she settled down to patch george s other pair and be a good wife but he is glued to the high horse and won t come down well she hands him back the ring proper enough and george goes away and hits the booze yep that s what done it i bet that girl fired the cornucopia with the fancy vest two days after her steady left george boards a freight and checks his bag of crackers for parts unknown he sticks to old booze for a number of years and then the aniline and aquafortis gets the decision me for the hermit s hut says george and the long whiskers and the buried can of money that isn t there but that alice in my mind was on the level she never married but took up typewriting as soon as the wrinkles began to show and kept a cat that came when you said weeny weeny weeny i got too much faith in good women to believe they throw down the fellow they re stuck on every time for the dough the windmill man ceased i think said the lady passenger slightly moving upon her lowly throne that that is a char oh miss garland interposed judge menefee with uplifted hand i beg of you no comments it would not be fair to the other contestants mr er will you take the next turn the judge addressed the young man who had the agency my version of the romance began the young man diffidently clasping his hands would be this they did not quarrel when they parted mr redruth bade her good by and went out into the world to seek his fortune he knew his love would remain true to him he scorned the thought that his rival could make an impression upon a heart so fond and faithful i would say that mr redruth went out to the rocky mountains in wyoming to seek for gold one day a crew of pirates landed and captured him while at work and hey what s that sharply called the passenger who was nobody in particular a crew of pirates landed in the rocky mountains will you tell us how they sailed landed from a train said the narrator quietly and not without some readiness they kept him prisoner in a cave for months and then they took him hundreds of miles away to the forests of alaska there a beautiful indian girl fell in love with him but he remained true to alice after another year of wandering in the woods he set out with the diamonds what diamonds asked the unimportant passenger almost with acerbity the ones the saddlemaker showed him in the peruvian temple said the other somewhat obscurely when he reached home alice s mother led him weeping to a green mound under a willow tree her heart was broken when you left said her mother and what of my rival of chester mcintosh asked mr redruth as he knelt sadly by alice s grave when he found out she answered that her heart was yours he pined away day by day until at length he started a furniture store in grand rapids we heard lately that he was bitten to death by an infuriated moose near south bend ind where he had gone to try to forget scenes of civilisation with which mr redruth forsook the face of mankind and became a hermit as we have seen my story concluded the young man with an agency may lack the literary quality but what i wanted it to show is that the young lady remained true she cared nothing for wealth in comparison with true affection i admire and believe in the fair sex too much to think otherwise the narrator ceased with a sidelong glance at the corner where reclined the lady passenger bildad rose was next invited by judge menefee to contribute his story in the contest for the apple of judgment the stage driver s essay was brief i m not one of them lobo wolves he said who are always blaming on women the calamities of life my testimony in regards to the fiction story you ask for judge will be about as follows what ailed redruth was pure laziness if he had up and slugged this percival de lacey that tried to give him the outside of the road and had kept alice in the grape vine swing with the blind bridle on all would have been well the woman you want is sure worth taking pains for send for me if you want me again says redruth and hoists his stetson and walks off he d have called it pride but the nixycomlogical name for it is laziness no woman don t like to run after a man let him come back hisself says the girl and i ll

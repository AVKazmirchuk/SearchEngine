send down a big box of novels and reading matter for marthy things were going to be different he wondered whether a little piano could be placed in one of the rooms of the ranch house without the family having to move out of doors in nowise calculated to allay his self reproach was the thought that marthy and randy would have to pass the night alone in spite of their bickerings when night came marthy was wont to dismiss her fears of the country and rest her head upon sam s strong arm with a sigh of peaceful content and dependence and were her fears so groundless sam thought of roving marauding mexicans of stealthy cougars that sometimes invaded the ranches of rattlesnakes centipedes and a dozen possible dangers marthy would be frantic with fear randy would cry and call for dada to come still the interminable succession of stretches of brush cactus and mesquite hollow after hollow slope after slope all exactly alike all familiar by constant repetition and yet all strange and new if he could only arrive somewhere the straight line is art nature moves in circles a straightforward man is more an artificial product than a diplomatist is men lost in the snow travel in exact circles until they sink exhausted as their footprints have attested also travellers in philosophy and other mental processes frequently wind up at their starting point it was when sam webber was fullest of contrition and good resolves that mexico with a heavy sigh subsided from his regular brisk trot into a slow complacent walk they were winding up an easy slope covered with brush ten or twelve feet high i say now mex demurred sam this here won t do i know you re plumb tired out but we got ter git along oh lordy ain t there no mo houses in the world he gave mexico a smart kick with his heels mexico gave a protesting grunt as if to say what s the use of that now we re so near he quickened his gait into a languid trot rounding a great clump of black chaparral he stopped short sam dropped the bridle reins and sat looking into the back door of his own house not ten yards away marthy serene and comfortable sat in her rocking chair before the door in the shade of the house with her feet resting luxuriously upon the steps randy who was playing with a pair of spurs on the ground looked up for a moment at his father and went on spinning the rowels and singing a little song marthy turned her head lazily against the back of the chair and considered the arrivals with emotionless eyes she held a book in her lap with her finger holding the place sam shook himself queerly like a man coming out of a dream and slowly dismounted he moistened his dry lips i see you are still a settin he said a readin of them billy by dam yaller back novils sam had traveled round the circle and was himself again the rubber plant s story we rubber plants form the connecting link between the vegetable kingdom and the decorations of a waldorf astoria scene in a third avenue theatre i haven t looked up our family tree but i believe we were raised by grafting a gum overshoe on to a cent table d hote stalk of asparagus you take a white bulldog with a bourke cockran air of independence about him and a rubber plant and there you have the fauna and flora of a flat what the shamrock is to ireland the rubber plant is to the dweller in flats and furnished rooms we get moved from one place to another so quickly that the only way we can get our picture taken is with a kinetoscope we are the vagrant vine and the flitting fig tree you know the proverb where the rubber plant sits in the window the moving van draws up to the door we are the city equivalent to the woodbine and the honeysuckle no other vegetable except the pittsburg stogie can withstand as much handling as we can when the family to which we belong moves into a flat they set us in the front window and we become lares and penates fly paper and the peripatetic emblem of home sweet home we aren t as green as we look i guess we are about what you would call the soubrettes of the conservatory you try sitting in the front window of a flat in manhattan and looking out into the street all day and back into the flat at night and see whether you get wise or not hey talk about the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden of eden say suppose there had been a rubber plant there when eve but i was going to tell you a story the first thing i can remember i had only three leaves and belonged to a member of the pony ballet i was kept in a sunny window and was generally watered with seltzer and lemon i had plenty of fun in those days i got cross eyed trying to watch the numbers of the automobiles in the street and the dates on the labels inside at the same time well then the angel that was molting for the musical comedy lost his last feather and the company broke up the ponies trotted away and i was left in the window ownerless the janitor gave me to a refined comedy team on the eighth floor and in six weeks i had been set in the window of five different flats i took on experience and put out two more leaves miss carruthers of the refined comedy team did you ever see her cross both feet back of her neck gave me to a friend of hers who had made an unfortunate marriage with a man in a store consequently i was placed in the window of a furnished room rent in advance water two flights up gas extra after ten o clock at night two of my leaves withered off here also i was moved from one room to another so many times that i got to liking the odor of the pipes the expressmen smoked i don t think i ever had so dull a time as i did with this lady there was never anything amusing going on inside she was devoted to her husband and besides leaning out the window and flirting with the iceman she never did a thing toward breaking the monotony when the couple broke up they left me with the rest of their goods at a second hand store i was put out in front for sale along with the jobbiest lot you ever heard of being lumped into one bargain think of this little cornucopia of wonders all for henry james s works six talking machine records one pair of tennis shoes two bottles of horse radish and a rubber plant that was me one afternoon a girl came along and stopped to look at me she had dark hair and eyes and she looked slim and sad around the mouth oh oh she says to herself i never thought to see one up here she pulls out a little purse about as thick as one of my leaves and fingers over some small silver in it old koen always on the lockout is ready rubbing his hands this girl proceeds to turn down mr james and the other commodities rubber plants or nothing is the burden of her song and at last koen and she come together at cents and away she goes with me in her arms she was a nice girl but not my style too quiet and sober looking thinks i to myself i ll just about land on the fire escape of a tenement six stories up and i ll spend the next six months looking at clothes on the line but she carried me to a nice little room only three flights up in quite a decent street and she put me in the window of course and then she went to work and cooked dinner for herself and what do you suppose she had bread and tea and a little dab of jam nothing else not a single lobster nor so much as one bottle of champagne the carruthers comedy team had both every evening except now and then when they took a notion for pig s knuckle and kraut after she had finished her dinner my new owner came to the window and leaned down close to my leaves and cried softly to herself for a while it made me feel funny i never knew anybody to cry that way over a rubber plant before of course i ve seen a few of em turn on the tears for what they could get out of it but she seemed to be crying just for the pure enjoyment of it she touched my leaves like she loved em and she bent down her head and kissed each one of em i guess i m about the toughest specimen of a peripatetic orchid on earth but i tell you it made me feel sort of queer home never was like that to me before generally i used to get chewed by poodles and have shirt waists hung on me to dry and get watered with coffee grounds and peroxide of hydrogen this girl had a piano in the room and she used to disturb it with both hands while she made noises with her mouth for hours at a time i suppose she was practising vocal music one day she seemed very much excited and kept looking at the clock at eleven somebody knocked and she let in a stout dark man with towsled black hair he sat down at once at the piano and played while she sang for him when she finished she laid one hand on her bosom and looked at him he shook his head and she leaned against the piano two years already she said speaking slowly do you think in two more or even longer the man shook his head again you waste your time he said roughly i thought the voice is not there and then he looked at her in a peculiar way but the voice is not everything he went on you have looks i can place you as i told you if the girl pointed to the door without saying anything and the dark man left the room and then she came over and cried around me again it s a good thing i had enough rubber in me to be water proof about that time somebody else knocked at the door thank goodness i said to myself here s a chance to get the water works turned off i hope it s somebody that s game enough to stand a bird and a bottle to liven things up a little tell you the truth this little girl made me tired a rubber plant likes to see a little sport now and then i don t suppose there s another green thing in new york that sees as much of gay life unless it s the chartreuse or the sprigs of parsley around the dish when the girl opens the door in steps a young chap in a traveling cap and picks her up in his arms and she sings out oh dick and stays there long enough to well you ve been a rubber plant too sometimes i suppose good thing says i to myself this is livelier than scales and weeping now there ll be something doing you ve got to go back with me says the young man i ve come two thousand miles for you aren t you tired of it yet bess you ve kept all of us waiting so long haven t you found out yet what is best the bubble burst only to day says the girl come here dick and see what i found the other day on the sidewalk for sale she brings him by the hand and exhibits yours truly how one ever got away up here who can tell i bought it with almost the last money i had he looked at me but he couldn t keep his eyes off her for more than a second do you remember the night bess he said when we stood under one of those on the bank of the bayou and what you told me then geewillikins i said to myself both of them stand under a rubber plant seems to me they are stretching matters somewhat do i not says she looking up at him and sneaking close to his vest and now i say it again and it is to last forever look dick at its leaves how wet they are those are my tears and it was thinking of you that made them fall the dear old magnolias says the young man pinching one of my leaves i love them all magnolia well wouldn t that say those innocents thought i was a magnolia what the well wasn t that tough on a genuine little old new york rubber plant out of nazareth okochee in georgia had a boom and j pinkney bloom came out of it with a wad okochee came out of it with a half million dollar debt a two and a half per cent city property tax and a city council that showed a propensity for traveling the back streets of the town these things came about through a fatal resemblance of the river cooloosa to the hudson as set forth and expounded by a northern tourist okochee felt that new york should not be allowed to consider itself the only alligator in the swamp so to speak and then that harmless but persistent individual so numerous in the south the man who is always clamoring for more cotton mills and is ready to take a dollar s worth of stock provided he can borrow the dollar that man added his deadly work to the tourist s innocent praise and okochee fell the cooloosa river winds through a range of small mountains passes okochee and then blends its waters trippingly as fall the mellifluous indian syllables with the chattahoochee okochee rose as it were from its sunny seat on the post office stoop hitched up its suspender and threw a granite dam two hundred and forty feet long and sixty feet high across the cooloosa one mile above the town thereupon a dimpling sparkling lake backed up twenty miles among the little mountains thus in the great game of municipal rivalry did okochee match that famous drawing card the hudson it was conceded that nowhere could the palisades be judged superior in the way of scenery and grandeur following the picture card was played the ace of commercial importance fourteen thousand horsepower would this dam furnish cotton mills factories and manufacturing plants would rise up as the green corn after a shower the spindle and the flywheel and turbine would sing the shrewd glory of okochee along the picturesque heights above the lake would rise in beauty the costly villas and the splendid summer residences of capital the naphtha launch of the millionaire would spit among the romantic coves the verdured hills would take formal shapes of terrace lawn and park money would be spent like water in okochee and water would be turned into money the fate of the good town is quickly told capital decided not to invest of all the great things promised the scenery alone came to fulfilment the wooded peaks the impressive promontories of solemn granite the beautiful green slants of bank and ravine did all they could to reconcile okochee to the delinquency of miserly gold the sunsets gilded the dreamy draws and coves with a minting that should charm away heart burning okochee true to the instinct of its blood and clime was lulled by the spell it climbed out of the arena loosed its suspender sat down again on the post office stoop and took a chew it consoled itself by drawling sarcasms at the city council which was not to blame causing the fathers as has been said to seek back streets and figure perspiringly on the sinking fund and the appropriation for interest due the youth of okochee they who were to carry into the rosy future the burden of the debt accepted failure with youth s uncalculating joy for here was sport aquatic and nautical added to the meagre round of life s pleasures in yachting caps and flowing neckties they pervaded the lake to its limits girls wore silk waists embroidered with anchors in blue and pink the trousers of the young men widened at the bottom and their hands were proudly calloused by the oft plied oar fishermen were under the spell of a deep and tolerant jjoy sailboats and rowboats furrowed the lenient waves popcorn and ice cream booths sprang up about the little wooden pier two small excursion steamboats were built and plied the delectable waters okochee philosophically gave up the hope of eating turtle soup with a gold spoon and settled back not ill content to its regular diet of lotus and fried hominy and out of this slow wreck of great expectations rose up j pinkney bloom with his wad and his prosperous cheery smile needless to say j pinkney was no product of georgia soil he came out of that flushed and capable region known as the north he called himself a promoter his enemies had spoken of him as a grafter okochee took a middle course and held him to be no better nor no worse than a yank far up the lake eighteen miles above the town the eye of this cheerful camp follower of booms had spied out a graft he purchased there a precipitous tract of five hundred acres at forty five cents per acre and this he laid out and subdivided as the city of skyland the queen city of the switzerland of the south streets and avenues were surveyed parks designed corners of central squares reserved for the proposed opera house board of trade lyceum market public schools and exposition hall the price of lots ranged from five to five hundred dollars positively no lot would be priced higher than five hundred dollars while the boom was growing in okochee j pinkney s circulars maps and prospectuses were flying through the mails to every part of the country investors sent in their money by post and the skyland real estate company j pinkney bloom returned to each a deed duly placed on record to the best lot at the price on hand that day all this time the catamount screeched upon the reserved lot of the skyland board of trade the opossum swung by his tail over the site of the exposition hall and the owl hooted a melancholy recitative to his audience of young squirrels in opera house square later when the money was coming in fast j pinkney caused to be erected in the coming city half a dozen cheap box houses and persuaded a contingent of indigent natives to occupy them thereby assuming the role of poulation in subsequent prospectuses which became accordingly more seductive and remunerative so when the dream faded and okochee dropped back to digging bait and nursing its two and a half per cent tax j pinkney bloom unloving of checks and drafts and the cold interrogatories of bankers strapped about his fifty two inch waist a soft leather belt containing eight thousand dollars in big bills and said that all was very good one last trip he was making to skyland before departing to other salad fields skyland was a regular post office and the steamboat dixie belle under contract delivered the mail bag generally empty twice a week there was a little business there to be settled the postmaster was to be paid off for his light but lonely services and the inhabitants had to be furnished with another month s homely rations as per agreement and then skyland would know j pinkney bloom no more the owners of these precipitous barren useless lots might come and view the scene of their invested credulity or they might leave them to their fit tenants the wild hog and the browsing deer the work of the skyland real estate company was finished the little steamboat dixie belle was about to shove off on her regular up the lake trip when a rickety hired carriage rattled up to the pier and a tall elderly gentleman in black stepped out signaling courteously but vivaciously for the boat to wait time was of the least importance in the schedule of the dixie belle captain macfarland gave the order and the boat received its ultimate two passengers for upon the arm of the tall elderly gentleman as he crossed the gangway was a little elderly lady with a gray curl depending quaintly forward of her left ear captain macfarland was at the wheel therefore it seemed to j pinkney bloom who was the only other passenger that it should be his to play the part of host to the boat s new guests who were doubtless on a scenery viewing expedition he stepped forward with that translucent child candid smile upon his fresh pink countenance with that air of unaffected sincerity that was redeemed from bluffness only by its exquisite calculation with that promptitude and masterly decision of manner that so well suited his calling with all his stock in trade well to the front he stepped forward to receive colonel and mrs peyton blaylock with the grace of a grand marshal or a wedding usher he escorted the two passengers to a side of the upper deck from which the scenery was supposed to present itself to the observer in increased quantity and quality there in comfortable steamer chairs they sat and began to piece together the random lines that were to form an intelligent paragraph in the big history of little events our home sir said colonel blaylock removing his wide brimmed rather shapeless black felt hat is in holly springs holly springs georgia i am very proud to make your acquaintance mr bloom mrs blaylock and myself have just arrived in okochee this morning sir on business business of importance in connection with the recent rapid march of progress in this section of our state the colonel smoothed back with a sweeping gesture his long smooth locks his dark eyes still fiery under the heavy black brows seemed inappropriate to the face of a business man he looked rather to be an old courtier handed down from the reign of charles and re attired in a modern suit of fine but raveling and seam worn broadcloth yes sir said mr bloom in his heartiest prospectus voice things have been whizzing around okochee biggest industrial revival and waking up to natural resources georgia ever had did you happen to squeeze in on the ground floor in any of the gilt edged grafts colonel well sir said the colonel hesitating in courteous doubt if i understand your question i may say that i took the opportunity to make an investment that i believe will prove quite advantageous yes sir i believe it will result in both pecuniary profit and agreeable occupation colonel blaylock said the little edlerly lady shaking her gray curl and smiling indulgent explanation at j pinkney bloom is so devoted to businesss he has such a talent for financiering and markets and investments and those kind of things i think myself extremely fortunate in having secured him for a partner on life s journey i am so unversed in those formidable but very useful branches of learning colonel blaylock rose and made a bow a bow that belonged with silk stockings and lace ruffles and velvet practical affairs he said with a wave of his hand toward the promoter are if i may use the comparison the garden walks upon which we tread through life viewing upon either side of us the flowers which brighten that journey it is my pleasure to be able to lay out a walk or two mrs blaylock sir is one of those fortunate higher spirits whose mission it is to make the flowers grow perhaps mr bloom you have perused the lines of lorella the southern poetess that is the name above which mrs blaylock has contributed to the press of the south for many years unfortunately said mr bloom with a sense of the loss clearly written upon his frank face i m like the colonel in the walk making business myself and i haven t had time to even take a sniff at the flowers poetry is a line i never dealt in it must be nice though quite nice it is the region smiled mrs blaylock in which my soul dwells my shawl peyton if you please the breeze comes a little chilly from yon verdured hills the colonel drew from the tail pocket of his coat a small shawl of knitted silk and laid it solicitously about the shoulders of the lady mrs blaylock sighed contentedly and turned her expressive eyes still as clear and unworldly as a child s upon the steep slopes that were slowly slipping past very fair and stately they looked in the clear morning air they seemed to speak in familiar terms to the responsive spirit of lorella my native hills she murmured dreamily see how the foliage drinks the sunlight from the hollows and dells mrs blaylock s maiden days said the colonel interpreting her mood to j pinkney bloom were spent among the mountains of northern georgia mountain air and mountain scenery recall to her those days holly springs where we have lived for twenty years is low and flat i fear that she may have suffered in health and spirits by so long a residence there that is one portent reason for the change we are making my dear can you not recall those lines you wrote entitled i think the georgia hills the poem that was so extensively copied by the southern press and praised so highly by the atlanta critics mrs blaylock turned a glance of speaking tenderness upon the colonel fingered for a moment the silvery curl that drooped upon her bosom then looked again toward the mountains without preliminary or affectation or demurral she began in rather thrilling and more deeply pitched tones to recite these lines the georgia hills the georgia hills oh heart why dost thou pine are not these sheltered lowlands fair with mead and bloom and vine ah as the slow paced river here broods on its natal rills my spirit drifts in longing sweet back to the georgia hills and through the close drawn curtained night i steal on sleep s slow wings back to my heart s ease slopes of pine where end my wanderings oh heaven seems nearer from their tops and farther earthly ills even in dreams if i may but dream of my georgia hills the grass upon their orchard sides is a fine couch to me the common note of each small bird passes all minstrelsy it would not seem so dread a thing if when the reaper wills he might come there and take my hand up in the georgia hills thats great stuff ma am said j pinkney bloom enthusiastically when the poetess had concluded i wish i had looked up poetry more than i have i was raised in the pine hills myself the mountains ever call to their children murmured mrs blaylock i feel that life will take on the rosy hue of hope again in among these beautiful hills peyton a little taste of the currant wine if you will be so good the journey though delightful in the extreme slightly fatigues me colonel blaylock again visited the depths of his prolific coat and produced a tightly corked rough black bottle mr bloom was on his feet in an instant let me bring a glass ma am you come along colonel there s a little table we can bring too maybe we can scare up some fruit or a cup of tea on board i ll ask mac mrs blaylock reclined at ease few royal ladies have held their royal prerogative with the serene grace of the petted southern woman the colonel with an air as gallant and assiduous as in the days of his courtship and j pinkney bloom with a ponderous agility half professional and half directed by some resurrected unnamed long forgotten sentiment formed a diversified but attentive court the currant wine wine home made from the holly springs fruit went round and then j pinkney began to hear something of holly springs life it seemed from the conversation of the blaylocks that the springs was decadent a third of the population had moved away business and the colonel was an authority on business had dwindled to nothing after carefully studying the field of opportunities open to capital he had sold his little property there for eight hundred dollars and invested it in one of the enterprises opened up by the book in okochee might i inquire sir said mr bloom in what particular line of business you inserted your coin i know that town as well as i know the regulations for illegal use of the mails i might give you a hunch as to whether you can make the game go or not j pinkney somehow had a kindly feeling toward these unsophisticated representatives of by gone days they were so simple impractical and unsuspecting he was glad that he happened not to have a gold brick or a block of that western bad boy silver mine stock along with him he would have disliked to unload on people he liked so well as he did these but there are some temptations toe enticing to be resisted no sir said colonel blaylock pausing to arrange the queen s wrap i did not invest in okochee i have made an exhaustive study of business conditions and i regard old settled towns as unfavorable fields in which to place capital that is limited in amount some months ago through the kindness of a friend there came into my hands a map and description of this new town of skyland that has been built upon the lake the description was so pleasing the future of the town set forth in such convincing arguments and its increasing prosperity portrayed in such an attractive style that i decided to take advantage of the opportunity it offered i carefully selected a lot in the centre of the business district although its price was the highest in the schedule five hundred dollars and made the purchase at once are you the man i mean did you pay five hundred dollars for a lot in skyland asked j pinkney bloom i did sir answered the colonel with the air of a modest millionaire explaining his success a lot most excellently situated on the same square with the opera house and only two squares from the board of trade i consider the purchase a most fortuitous one it is my intention to erect a small building upon it at once and open a modest book and stationery store during past years i have met with many pecuniary reverses and i now find it necessary to engage in some commercial occupation that will furnish me with a livelihood the book and stationery business though an humble one seems to me not inapt nor altogether uncongenial i am a graduate of the university of virginia and mrs blaylock s really wonderful acquaintance with belles lettres and poetic literature should go far toward insuring success of course mrs blaylock would not personally serve behind the counter with the nearly three hundred dollars i have remaining i can manage the building of a house by giving a lien on the lot i have an old friend in atlanta who is a partner in a large book store and he has agreed to furnish me with a stock of goods on credit on extremely easy terms i am pleased to hope sir that mrs blaylock s health and happiness will be increased by the change of locality already i fancy i can perceive the return of those roses that were once the hope and despair of georgia cavaliers again followed that wonderful bow as the colonel lightly touched the pale cheek of the poetess mrs blaylock blushing like a girl shook her curl and gave the colonel an arch reproving tap secret of eternal youth where art thou every second the answer comes here here here listen to thine own heartbeats weary seeker after external miracles those years said mrs blaylock in holly springs were long long long but now is the promised land in sight skyland a lovely name doubtless said the colonel we shall be able to secure comfortable accommodations at some modest hotel at reasonable rates our trunks are in okochee to be forwarded when we shall have made permanent arrangements j pinkney bloom excused himself went forward and stood by the captain at the wheel mac said he do you remember my telling you once that i sold one of those five hundred dollar lots in skyland seems i do grinned captain macfarland i m not a coward as a general rule went on the promoter but i always said that if i ever met the sucker that bought that lot i d run like a turkey now you see that old babe in the wood over there well he s the boy that drew the prize that was the only five hundred dollar lot that went the rest ranged from ten dollars to two hundred his wife writes poetry she s invented one about the high grounds of georgia that s way up in g they re going to skyland to open a book store well said macfarland with another grin it s a good thing you are along j p you can show em around town until they begin to feel at home he s got three hundred dollars left to build a house and store with went on j pinkney as if he were talking to himself and he thinks there s an open house up there captain macfarland released the wheel long enough to give his leg a roguish slap you old fat rascal he chuckled with a wink mac you re a fool said j pinkney bloom coldly he went back and joined the blaylocks where he sat less talkative with that straight furrow between his brows that always stood as a signal of schemes being shaped within there s a good many swindles connected with these booms he said presently what if this skyland should turn out to be one that is suppose business should be sort of dull there and no special sale for books my dear sir said colonel blaylock resting his hand upon the back of his wife s chair three times i have been reduced to almost penury by the duplicity of others but i have not yet lost faith in humanity if i have been deceived again still we may glean health and content if not worldly profit i am aware that there are dishonest schemers in the world who set traps for the unwary but even they are not altogether bad my dear can you recall those verses entitled he giveth the increase that you composed for the choir of our church in holly springs that was four years ago said mrs blaylock perhans i can repeat a verse or two the lily springs from the rotting mould pearls from the deep sea slime good will come out of nazareth all in god s own time to the hardest heart the softening grace cometh at last to bless guiding it right to help and cheer and succor in distress i cannot remember the rest the lines were not ambitious they were written to the music composed by a dear friend it s a fine rhyme just the same declared mr bloom it seems to ring the bell all right i guess i gather the sense of it it means that the rankest kind of a phony will give you the best end of it once in a while mr bloom strayed thoughtfully back to the captain and stood meditating ought to be in sight of the spires and gilded domes of skyland now in a few minutes chirruped macfarland shaking with enjoyment go to the devil said mr bloom still pensive and now upon the left bank they caught a glimpse of a white village high up on the hills smothered among green trees that was cold branch no boom town but the slow growth of many years cold branch lay on the edge of the grape and corn lands the big country road ran just back of the heights cold branch had nothing in common with the frisky ambition of okochee with its impertinent lake mac said j pinkney suddenly i want you to stop at cold branch there s a landing there that they made to use sometimes when the river was up can t said the captain grinning more broadly i ve got the united states mails on board right to day this boat s in the government service do you want to have the poor old captain keelhauled by uncle sam and the great city of skyland all disconsolate waiting for its mail i m ashamed of your extravagance j p mac almost whispered j pinkney in his danger line voice i looked into the engine room of the dixie belle a while ago don t you know of somebody that needs a new boiler cement and black japan can t hide flaws from me and then those shares of building and loan that you traded for repairs they were all yours of course i hate to mention these things but oh come now j p said the captain you know i was just fooling i ll put you off at cold branch if you say so the other passengers get off there too said mr bloom further conversation was held and in ten minutes the dixie belle turned her nose toward a little cranky wooden pier on the left bank and the captain relinquishing the wheel to a roustabout came to the passenger deck and made the remarkable announcement all out for skyland the blaylocks and j pinkney bloom disembarked and the dixie belle proceeded on her way up the lake guided by the indefatigable promoter they slowly climbed the steep hillside pausing often to rest and admire the view finally they entered the village of cold branch warmly both the colonel and his wife praised it for its homelike and peaceful beauty mr bloom conducted them to a two story building on a shady street that bore the legend pine top inn here he took his leave receiving the cordial thanks of the two for his attentions the colonel remarking that he thought they would spend the remainder of the day in rest and take a look at his purchase on the morrow j pinkney bloom walked down cold branch s main street he did not know this town but he knew towns and his feet did not falter presently he saw a sign over a door frank e cooly attorney at law and notary public a young man was mr cooly and awaiting business get your hat son said mr bloom in his breezy way and a blank deed and come along it s a job for you now he continued when mr cooly had responded with alacrity is there a bookstore in town one said the lawyer henry williams s get there said mr bloom we re going to buy it henry williams was behind his counter his store was a small one containing a mixture of books stationery and fancy rubbish adjoining it was henry s home a decent cottage vine embowered and cosy henry was lank and soporific and not inclined to rush his business i want to buy your house and store said mr bloom i haven t got time to dicker name your price it s worth eight hundred said henry too much dazed to ask more than its value shut that door said mr bloom to the lawyer then he tore off his coat and vest and began to unbutton his shirt wanter fight about it do yer said henry williams jumping up and cracking his heels together twice all right hunky sail in and cut yer capers keep your clothes on said mr bloom i m only going down to the bank he drew eight one hundred dollar bills from his money belt and planked them down on the counter mr cooly showed signs of future promise for he already had the deed spread out and was reaching across the counter for the ink bottle never before or since was such quick action had in cold branch your name please asked the lawyer make it out to peyton blaylock said mr bloom god knows how to spell it within thirty minutes henry williams was out of business and mr bloom stood on the brick sidewalk with mr cooly who held in his hand the signed and attested deed you ll find the party at the pinetop inn said j pinkney bloom get it recorded and take it down and give it to him he ll ask you a hell s mint of questions so here s ten dollars for the trouble you ll have in not being able to answer em never run much to poetry did you young man well said the really talented cooly who even yet retained his right mind now and then dig into it said mr bloom it ll pay you never heard a poem now that run something like this did you a good thing out of nazareth comes up sometimes i guess on hand all right to help and cheer a sucker in distress i believe not said mr cooly it s a hymn said j pinkney bloom now show me the way to a livery stable son for i m going to hit the dirt road back to okochee confessions of a humorist there was a painless stage of incubation that lasted twenty five years and then it broke out on me and people said i was it but they called it humor instead of measles the employees in the store bought a silver inkstand for the senior partner on his fiftieth birthday we crowded into his private office to present it i had been selected for spokesman and i made a little speech that i had been preparing for a week it made a hit it was full of puns and epigrams and funny twists that brought down the house which was a very solid one in the wholesale hardware line old marlowe himself actually grinned and the employees took their cue and roared my reputation as a humorist dates from half past nine o clock on that morning for weeks afterward my fellow clerks fanned the flame of my self esteem one by one they came to me saying what an awfully clever speech that was old man and carefully explained to me the point of each one of my jokes gradually i found that i was expected to keep it up others might speak sanely on business matters and the day s topics but from me something gamesome and airy was required i was expected to crack jokes about the crockery and lighten up the granite ware with persiflage i was second bookkeeper and if i failed to show up a balance sheet without something comic about the footings or could find no cause for laughter in an invoice of plows the other clerks were disappointed by degrees my fame spread and i became a local character our town was small enough to make this possible the daily newspaper quoted me at social gatherings i was indispensable i believe i did possess considerable wit and a facility for quick and spontaneous repartee this gift i cultivated and improved by practice and the nature of it was kindly and genial not running to sarcasm or offending others people began to smile when they saw me coming and by the time we had met i generally had the word ready to broaden the smile into a laugh i had married early we had a charming boy of three and a girl of five naturally we lived in a vine covered cottage and were happy my salary as bookkeeper in the hardware concern kept at a distance those ills attendant upon superfluous wealth at sundry times i had written out a few jokes and conceits that i considered peculiarly happy and had sent them to certain periodicals that print such things all of them had been instantly accepted several of the editors had written to request further contributions one day i received a letter from the editor of a famous weekly publication he suggested that i submit to him a humorous composition to fill a column of space hinting that he would make it a regular feature of each issue if the work proved satisfactory i did so and at the end of two weeks he offered to make a contract with me for a year at a figure that was considerably higher than the amount paid me by the hardware firm i was filled with delight my wife already crowned me in her mind with the imperishable evergreens of literary success we had lobster croquettes and a bottle of blackberry wine for supper that night here was the chance to liberate myself from drudgery i talked over the matter very seriously with louisa we agreed that i must resign my place at the store and devote myself to humor i resigned my fellow clerks gave me a farewell banquet the speech i made there coruscated it was printed in full by the gazette the next morning i awoke and looked at the clock late by george i exclaimed and grabbed for my clothes louisa reminded me that i was no longer a slave to hardware and contractors supplies i was now a professional humorist after breakfast she proudly led me to the little room off the kitchen dear girl there was my table and chair writing pad ink and pipe tray and all the author s trappings the celery stand full of fresh roses and honeysuckle last year s calendar on the wall the dictionary and a little bag of chocolates to nibble between inspirations dear girl i sat me to work the wall paper is patterned with arabesques or odalisks or perhaps it is trapezoids upon one of the figures i fixed my eyes i bethought me of humor a voice startled me louisa s voice if you aren t too busy dear it said come to dinner i looked at my watch yes five hours had been gathered in by the grim scytheman i went to dinner you mustn t work too hard at first said louisa goethe or was it napoleon said five hours a day is enough for mental labor couldn t you take me and the children to the woods this afternoon i am a little tired i admitted so we went to the woods but i soon got the swing of it within a month i was turning out copy as regular as shipments of hardware and i had success my column in the weekly made some stir and i was referred to in a gossipy way by the critics as something fresh in the line of humorists i augmented my income considerably by contributing to other publications i picked up the tricks of the trade i could take a funny idea and make a two line joke of it earning a dollar with false whiskers on it would serve up cold as a quatrain doubling its producing value by turning the skirt and adding a ruffle of rhyme you would hardly recognize it as vers de societe with neatly shod feet and a fashion plate illustration i began to save up money and we had new carpets and a parlor organ my townspeople began to look upon me as a citizen of some consequence instead of the merry trifier i had been when i clerked in the hardware store after five or six months the spontaniety seemed to depart from my humor quips and droll sayings no longer fell carelessly from my lips i was sometimes hard run for material i found myself listening to catch available ideas from the conversation of my friends sometimes i chewed my pencil and gazed at the wall paper for hours trying to build up some gay little bubble of unstudied fun and then i became a harpy a moloch a jonah a vampire to my acquaintances anxious haggard greedy i stood among them like a veritable killjoy let a bright saying a witty comparison a piquant phrase fall from their lips and i was after it like a hound springing upon a bone i dared not trust my memory but turning aside guiltily and meanly i would make a note of it in my ever present memorandum book or upon my cuff for my own future use my friends regarded me in sorrow and wonder i was not the same man where once i had furnished them entertainment and jollity i now preyed upon them no jests from me ever bid for their smiles now they were too precious i could not afford to dispense gratuitously the means of my livelihood i was a lugubrious fox praising the singing of my friends the crow s that they might drop from their beaks the morsels of wit that i coveted nearly every one began to avoid me i even forgot how to smile not even paying that much for the sayings i appropriated no persons places times or subjects were exempt from my plundering in search of material even in church my demoralized fancy went hunting among the solemn aisles and pillars for spoil did the minister give out the long meter doxology at once i began doxology sockdology sockdolager meter meet her the sermon ran through my mental sieve its precepts filtering unheeded could i but glean a suggestion of a pun or a bon mot the solemnest anthems of the choir were but an accompaniment to my thoughts as i conceived new changes to ring upon the ancient comicalities concerning the jealousies of soprano tenor and basso my own home became a hunting ground my wife is a singularly feminine creature candid sympathetic and impulsive once her conversation was my delight and her ideas a source of unfailing pleasure now i worked her she was a gold mine of those amusing but lovable inconsistencies that distinguish the female mind i began to market those pearls of unwisdom and humor that should have enriched only the sacred precincts of home with devilish cunning i encouraged her to talk unsuspecting she laid her heart bare upon the cold conspicuous common printed page i offered it to the public gaze a literary judas i kissed her and betrayed her for pieces of silver i dressed her sweet confidences in the pantalettes and frills of folly and made them dance in the market place dear louisa of nights i have bent over her cruel as a wolf above a tender lamb hearkening even to her soft words murmured in sleep hoping to catch an idea for my next day s grind there is worse to come god help me next my fangs were buried deep in the neck of the fugitive sayings of my little children guy and viola were two bright fountains of childish quaint thoughts and speeches i found a ready sale for this kind of humor and was furnishing a regular department in a magazine with funny fancies of childhood i began to stalk them as an indian stalks the antelope i would hide behind sofas and doors or crawl on my hands and knees among the bushes in the yard to eavesdrop while they were at play i had all the qualities of a harpy except remorse once when i was barren of ideas and my copy must leave in the next mail i covered myself in a pile of autumn leaves in the yard where i knew they intended to come to play i cannot bring myself to believe that guy was aware of my hiding place but even if he was i would be loath to blame him for his setting fire to the leaves causing the destruction of my new suit of clothes and nearly cremating a parent soon my own children began to shun me as a pest often when i was creeping upon them like a melancholy ghoul i would hear them say to each other here comes papa and they would gather their toys and scurry away to some safer hiding place miserable wretch that i was and yet i was doing well financially before the first year had passed i had saved a thousand dollars and we had lived in comfort but at what a cost i am not quite clear as to what a pariah is but i was everything that it sounds like i had no friends no amusements no enjoyment of life the happiness of my family had been sacrificed i was a bee sucking sordid honey from life s fairest flowers dreaded and shunned on account of my stingo one day a man spoke to me with a pleasant and friendly smile not in months had the thing happened i was passing the undertaking establishment of peter heffelbower peter stood in the door and saluted me i stopped strangely wrung in my heart by his greeting he asked me inside the day was chill and rainy we went into the back room where a fire burned in a little stove a customer came and peter left me alone for a while presently i felt a new feeling stealing over me a sense of beautiful calm and content i looked around the place there were rows of shining rosewood caskets black palls trestles hearse plumes mourning streamers and all the paraphernalia of the solemn trade here was peace order silence the abode of grave and dignified reflections here on the brink of life was a little niche pervaded by the spirit of eternal rest when i entered it the follies of the world abandoned me at the door i felt no inclination to wrest a humorous idea from those sombre and stately trappings my mind seemed to stretch itself to grateful repose upon a couch draped with gentle thoughts a quarter of an hour ago i was an abandoned humorist now i was a philosopher full of serenity and ease i had found a refuge from humor from the hot chase of the shy quip from the degrading pursuit of the panting joke from the restless reach after the nimble repartee i had not known heffelbower well when he came back i let him talk fearful that he might prove to be a jarring note in the sweet dirgelike harmony of his establishment but no he chimed truly i gave a long sigh of happiness never have i known a man s talk to be as magnificently dull as peter s was compared with it the dead sea is a geyser never a sparkle or a glimmer of wit marred his words commonplaces as trite and as plentiful as blackberries flowed from his lips no more stirring in quality than a last week s tape running from a ticker quaking a little i tried upon him one of my best pointed jokes it fell back ineffectual with the point broken i loved that man from then on two or three evenings each week i would steal down to heffelbower s and revel in his back room that was my only joy i began to rise early and hurry through my work that i might spend more time in my haven in no other place could i throw off my habit of extracting humorous ideas from my surroundings peter s talk left me no opening had i besieged it ever so hard under this influence i began to improve in spirits it was the recreation from one s labor which every man needs i surprised one or two of my former friends by throwing them a smile and a cheery word as i passed them on the streets several times i dumfounded my family by relaxing long enough to make a jocose remark in their presence i had so long been ridden by the incubus of humor that i seized my hours of holiday with a schoolboy s zest mv work began to suffer it was not the pain and burden to me that it had been i often whistled at my desk and wrote with far more fluency than before i accomplished my tasks impatiently as anxious to be off to my helpful retreat as a drunkard is to get to his tavern my wife had some anxious hours in conjecturing where i spent my afternoons i thought it best not to tell her women do not understand these things poor girl she had one shock out of it one day i brought home a silver coffin handle for a paper weight and a fine fluffy hearse plume to dust my papers with i loved to see them on my desk and think of the beloved back room down at heffelbower s but louisa found them and she shrieked with horror i had to console her with some lame excuse for having them but i saw in her eyes that the prejudice was not removed i had to remove the articles though at double quick time one day peter heffelbower laid before me a temptation that swept me off my feet in his sensible uninspired way he showed me his books and explained that his profits and his business were increasing rapidly he had thought of taking in a partner with some cash he would rather have me than any one he knew when i left his place that afternoon peter had my check for the thousand dollars i had in the bank and i was a partner in his undertaking business i went home with feelings of delirious joy mingled with a certain amount of doubt i was dreading to tell my wife about it but i walked on air to give up the writing of humorous stuff once more to enjoy the apples of life instead of squeezing them to a pulp for a few drops of hard cider to make the pubic feel funny what a boon that would be at the supper table louisa handed me some letters that had come during my absence several of them contained rejected manuscript ever since i first began going to heffelbower s my stuff had been coming back with alarming frequency lately i had been dashing off my jokes and articles with the greatest fluency previously

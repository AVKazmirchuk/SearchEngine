groves at length to emerge upon a bright stream where brown women in scant raiment laundered clothes destructively upon the rocks then the pack train fording the stream attacked the sudden ascent and bade adieu to such civilization as the coast afforded for weeks armstrong guided by luis followed his regular route among the mountains after he had col lected an arroba of the precious metal winning a profit of nearly the heads of the lightened mules were turned down trail again where the head of the guarico river springs from a great gash in the mountain side luis halted the train half a day s journey from here se or said he is the village of tacuzama which we have never visited i think many ounces of gold may be procured there it is worth the trial armstrong concurred and they turned again upward toward tacuzama the trail was abrupt and precipi tous mounting through a dense forest as night fell dark and gloomy luis once more halted before them was a black chasm bisecting the path as far as they could see luis dismounted there should be a bridge he called and ran along the cleft a distance it is here he cried and remounting led the way in a few moments armstrong heard a sound as though a thunderous drum were beating somewhere in the dark it was the falling of the mules hoofs upon the bridge made of strong hides lashed to poles and stretched across the chasm half a mile further was tacuzama the village was a congre gation of rock and mud huts set in the profundity of an obscure wood as they rode in a sound inconsistent with that brooding solitude met their ears from a long low mud hut that they were nearing rose the glorious voice of a woman in song the words were english the air familiar to armstrong s memory but not to his musical knowledge he slipped from his mule and stole to a narrow window in one end of the house peering cautiously inside he saw within three feet of him a woman of marvellous imposing beauty clothed in a splendid loose robe of leopard skins the hut was packed close to the small space in which she stood with the squatting figures of indians the woman finished her song and seated herself close to the little window as if grateful for the unpolluted air that entered it when she had ceased several of the audience rose and cast little softly falling bags at her feet a harsh murmur no doubt a barbarous kind of applause and comment went through the grim assembly armstrong was used to seizing opportunities promptly taking advantage of the noise he called to the woman in a low but distinct voice do not turn your head this way but listen i am an american if you need assistance tell me how i can render it answer as briefly as you can the woman was worthy of his boldness only by a sudden flush of her pale cheek did she acknowledge understanding of his words then she spoke scarcely moving her lips i am held a prisoner by these indians god knows i need help in two hours come to the little hut twenty yards toward the mountainside there will be a light and a red curtain in the window there is always a guard at the door whom you will have to overcome for the love of heaven do not fail to come the story seems to shrink from adventure and rescue and mystery the theme is one too gentle for those brave and quickening tones and yet it reaches as far back as time itself it has been named environment which is as weak a word as any to express the unnameable kinship of man to nature that queer fraternity that causes stones and trees and salt water and clouds to play upon our emotions why are we made serious and solemn and sublime by mountain heights grave and contempla tive by an abundance of overhanging trees reduced to inconstancy and monkey capers by the ripples on a sandy beach did the protoplasm but enough the chem ists are looking into the matter and before long they will have all life in the table of the symbols briefly then in order to confine the story within scientific bounds john armstrong went to the hut choked the indian guard and carried away mlle giraud with her was also conveyed a number of pounds of gold dust she had collected during her six months forced engage ment in tacuzama the carabobo indians are easily the most enthusiastic lovers of music between the equator and the french opera house in new orleans they are also strong believers that the advice of emerson was good when he said the thing thou wantest discon tented man take it and pay the price a number of them had attended the performance of the alcazar opera company in macuto and found mlle giraud s style and technique satisfactory they wanted her so they took her one evening suddenly and without any fuss they treated her with much consideration exacting only one song recital each day she was quite pleased at being rescued by mr armstrong so much for mystery and adventure now to resume the theory of the proto plasm john armstrong and mlle giraud rode among the andean peaks enveloped in their greatness and sublimity the mightiest cousins furthest removed in nature s great family become conscious of the tie among those huge piles of primordial upheaval amid those gigantic silences and elongated fields of distance the littlenesses of men are precipitated as one chemical throws down a sediment from another they moved reverently as in a temple their souls were uplifted in unison with the stately heights they travelled in a zone of majesty and peace to armstrong the woman seemed almost a holy thing yet bathed in the white still dignity of her martyrdom that purified her earthly beauty and gave out it seemed an aura of transcendent loveliness in those first hours of companionship she drew from him an adoration that was half human love half the worship of a descended goddess never yet since her rescue had she smiled over her dress she still wore the robe of leopard skins for mountain air was cold she looked to be some splendid princess belonging to those wild and awesome altitudes the spirit of the region chimed with hers her eyes were always turned upon the sombre cliffs the blue gorges and the snow clad turrets looking a sublime melancholy equal to their own at times on the journey she sang thrilling te deums and misereres that struck the true note of the hills and made their route seem like a solemn march down a cathedral aisle the rescued one spoke but seldom her mood partaking of the hush of nature that surrounded them armstrong looked upon her as an angel he could not bring himself to the sacrilege of attempting to woo her as other women may be wooed on the third day they had descended as far as the tierra templada the zona of the table lands and foot hills the mountains were receding in their rear but still towered exhibiting yet impressively their formidable heads here they met signs of man they saw the white houses of coffee plantations gleam across the clear ings they struck into a road where they met travellers and pack mules cattle were grazing on the slopes they passed a little village where the round eyed ni os shrieked and called at sight of them mlle giraud laid aside her leopard skin robe it seemed to be a trifle incongruous now in the moun tains it had appeared fitting and natural and if arm strong was not mistaken she laid aside with it something of the high dignity of her demeanour as the country became more populous and significant of comfortable life he saw with a feeling of joy that the exalted princess and priestess of the andean peaks was changing to a woman an earth woman but no less enticing a little colour crept to the surface of her marble cheek she arranged the conventional dress that the removal of the robe now disclosed with the solicitous touch of one who is conscious of the eyes of others she smoothed the careless sweep of her hair a mundane interest long latent in the chilling atmosphere of the ascetic peaks showed in her eyes this thaw in his divinity sent armstrong s heart going faster so might an arctic explorer thrill at his first ken of green fields and liquescent waters they were on a lower plane of earth and life and were succumbing to its peculiar subtle influence the austerity of the hills no longer thinned the air they breathed about them was the breath of fruit and corn and builded homes the comfortable smell of smoke and warm earth and the consolations man has placed between himself and the dust of his brother earth from which he sprung while traversing those awful mountains mile giraud had seemed to be wrapped in their spirit of reverent reserve was this that same woman now palpitating warm eager throbbing with conscious life and charm feminine to her finger tips pondering over this armstrong felt certain misgivings intrude upon his thoughts he wished he could stop there with this changing creature descending no farther here was the elevation and environment to which her nature seemed to respond with its best he feared to go down upon the man dominated levels would her spirit not yield still further in that artificial zone to which they were descending now from a little plateau they saw the sea flash at the edge of the green lowlands mile giraud gave a little catching sigh oh look mr armstrong there is the sea isn t it lovely i m so tired of mountains she heaved a pretty shoulder in a gesture of repugnance those horrid indians just think of what i suffered although i suppose i attained my ambition of becoming a stellar attraction i wouldn t care to repeat the engagement it was very nice of you to bring me away tell me mr armstrong honestly now do i look such an awful awful fright i haven t looked into a mirror you know for months armstrong made answer according to his changed moods also he laid his hand upon hers as it rested upon the horn of her saddle luis was at the head of the pack train and could not see she allowed it to remain there and her eyes smiled frankly into his then at sundown they dropped upon the coast level under the palms and lemons among the vivid greens and searlets and ochres of the tierra caliente they rode into macuto and saw the line of volatile bathers frolick ing in the surf the mountains were very far away mlle giraud s eyes were shining with a joy that could not have existed under the chaperonage of the mountain tops there were other spirits calling to her nymphs of the orange groves pixies from the chattering surf imps born of the music the perfumes colours and the insinuating presence of humanity she laughed aloud musically at a sudden thought won t there be a sensation she called to armstrong don t i wish i had an engagement just now though what a picnic the press agent would have held a prisoner by a band of savage indians subdued by the spell of her wonderful voice wouldn t that make great stuff but i guess i quit the game winner anyhow there ought to be a couple of thousand dollars in that sack of gold dust i collected as encores don t you think he left her at the door of the little hotel de buen descansar where she had stopped before two hours later he returned to the hotel he glanced in at the open door of the little combined reception room and cafe half a dozen of macuto s representative social and official caballeros were distributed about the room sefior villablanca the wealthy rubber concessionist reposed his fat figure on two chairs with an emollient smile beaming upon his chocolate coloured face guil bert the french mining engineer leered through his polished nose glasses colonel mendez of the regular army in gold laced uniform and fatuous grin was busily extracting corks from champagne bottles other pat terns of macutian gallantry and fashion pranced and posed the air was hazy with cigarette smoke wine dripped upon the floor perched upon a table in the centre of the room in an attitude of easy preeminence was mlle giraud a chic costume of white lawn and cherry ribbons supplanted her travelling garb there was a suggestion of lace and a frill or two with a discreet small implication of hand embroidered pink hosiery upon her lap rested a guitar in her face was the light of resurrection the peace of elysium attained through fire and suffering she was singing to a lively accompaniment a little song when you see de big round moon comin up like a balloon dis nigger skips fur to kiss de lips ob his stylish black faced coon the singer caught sight of armstrong hi there johnny she called i ve been expecting you for an hour what kept you gee but these smoked guys are the slowest you ever saw they ain t on at all come along in and i ll make this coffee coloured old sport with the gold epaulettes open one for you right off the ice thank you said armstrong not just now i believe i ve several things to attend to he walked out and down the street and met rucker coming up from the consulate play you a game of billiards said armstrong i want something to take the taste of the sea level out of my mouth girl in gilt letters on the ground glass of the door of room no were the words robbins hartley brokers the clerks had gone it was past five and with the solid tramp of a drove of prize percherons scrub women were invading the cloud capped twenty story office building a puff of red hot air flavoured with lemon peelings soft coal smoke and train oil came in through the half open windows robbins fifty something of an overweight beau and addicted to first nights and hotel palm rooms pretended to be envious of his partner s commuter s joys going to be something doing in the humidity line to night he said you out of town chaps will be the people with your katydids and moonlight and long drinks and things out on the front porch hartley twenty nine serious thin good looking ner vous sighed and frowned a little yes said he we always have cool nights in floral hurst especially in the winter a man with an air of mystery came in the door and went up to hartley i ve found where she lives he announced in the portentous half whisper that makes the detective at work a marked being to his fellow men hartley scowled him into a state of dramatic silence and quietude but by that time robbins had got his cane and set his tie pin to his liking and with a debonair nod went out to his metropolitan amusements here is the address said the detective in a natural tone being deprived of an audience to foil hartley took the leaf torn out of the sleuth s dingy memorandum book on it were pencilled the words vivienne arlington no east th street care of mrs mccomus moved there a week ago said the detective now if you want any shadowing done mr hartley i can do you as fine a job in that line as anybody in the city it will be only a day and expenses can send in a daily typewritten report covering you needn t go on interrupted the broker it isn t a case of that kind i merely wanted the address how much shall i pay you one day s work said the sleuth a tenner will cover it hartley paid the man and dismissed him then he left the office and boarded a broadway car at the first large crosstown artery of travel he took an eastbound car that deposited him in a decaying avenue whose ancient structures once sheltered the pride and glory of the town walking a few squares he came to the building that he sought it was a new flathouse bearing carved upon its cheap stone portal its sonorous name the vallambrosa fire escapes zigzagged down its front these laden with household goods drying clothes and squalling children evicted by the midsummer heat here and there a pale rubber plant peeped from the miscellaneous mass as if wondering to what kingdom it belonged vegetable animal or artificial hartley pressed the mccomus button the door latch clicked spasmodically now hospitably now doubt fully as though in anxiety whether it might be admitting friends or duns hartley entered and began to climb the stairs after the manner of those who seek their friends in city flat houses which is the manner of a boy who climbs an apple tree stopping when he comes upon what he wants on the fourth floor he saw vivienne standing in an open door she invited him inside with a nod and a bright genuine smile she placed a chair for him near a window and poised herself gracefully upon the edge of one of those jekyll and hyde pieces of furniture that are masked and mysteriously hooded unguessable bulks by day and inquisitorial racks of torture by night hartley cast a quick critical appreciative glance at her before speaking and told himself that his taste in choosing had been flawless vivienne was about twenty one she was of the purest saxon type her hair was a ruddy golden each filament of the neatly gathered mass shining with its own lustre and delicate graduation of colour in perfect harmony were her ivory clear complexion and deep sea blue eyes that looked upon the world with the ingenuous calmness of a mermaid or the pixie of an undiscovered mountain stream her frame was strong and yet possessed the grace of absolute naturalness and yet with all her north ern clearness and frankness of line and colouring there seemed to be something of the tropics in her something of languor in the droop of her pose of love of ease in her ingenious complacency of satisfaction and comfort in the mere act of breathing something that seemed to claim for her a right as a perfect work of nature to exist and be admired equally with a rare flower or some beauti ful milk white dove among its sober hued companions she was dressed in a white waist and dark skirt that discreet masquerade of goose girl and duchess vivienne said hartley looking at her pleadingly you did not answer my last letter it was only by nearly a week s search that i found where you had moved to why have you kept me in suspense when you knew how anxiously i was waiting to see you and hear from you the girl looked out the window dreamily mr hartley she said hesitatingly i hardly know what to say to you i realize all the advantages of your offer and sometimes i feel sure that i could be contented with you but again i am doubtful i was born a city girl and i am afraid to bind myself to a quiet sub urban life my dear girl said hartley ardently have i not told you that you shall have everything that your heart can desire that is in my power to give you you shall come to the city for the theatres for shopping and to visit your friends as often as you care to you can trust me can you not to the fullest she said turning her frank eyes upon him with a smile i know you are the kindest of men and that the girl you get will be a lucky one i learned all about you when i was at the montgomerys ah exclaimed hartley with a tender reminiscent light in his eye i remember well the evening i first saw you at the montgomerys mrs montgomery was sound ing your praises to me all the evening and she hardly did you justice i shall never forget that supper come vivienne promise me i want you you ll never regret coming with me no one else will ever give you as pleasant a home the girl sighed and looked down at her folded hands a sudden jealous suspicion seized hartley tell me vivienne he asked regarding her keenly is there another is there some one else a rosy flush crept slowly over her fair cheeks and neck you shouldn t ask that mr hartley she said in some confusion but i will tell you there is one other but he has no right i have promised him nothing his name demanded hartley sternly townsend rafford townsend exclaimed hartley with a grim tightening of his jaw how did that man come to know you after all i ve done for him his auto has just stopped below said vivienne bending over the window sill he s coming for his answer oh i don t know what to do the bell in the flat kitchen whirred vivienne hurried to press the latch button stay here said hartley i will meet him in the hall townsend looking like a spanish grandee in his light tweeds panama hat and curling black mustache came up the stairs three at a time he stopped at sight of hartley and looked foolish go back said hartley firmly pointing downstairs with his forefinger hullo said townsend feigning surprise what s up what are you doing here old man go back repeated hartley inflexibly the law of the jungle do you want the pack to tear you in pieces the kill is mine i came here to see a plumber about the bathroom connections said townsend bravely all right said hartley you shall have that lying plaster to stick upon your traitorous soul but go back townsend went downstairs leaving a bitter word to be wafted up the draught of the staircase hartley went back to his wooing vivienne said he masterfully i have got to have you i will take no more refusals or dilly dallying when do you want me she asked now as soon as you can get ready she stood calmly before him and looked him in the eye do you think for one moment she said that i would enter your home while h loise is there hartley cringed as if from an unexpected blow he folded his arms and paced the carpet once or twice she shall go he declared grimly drops stood upon his brow why should i let that woman make my life miserable never have i seen one day of freedom from trouble since i have known her you are right vivienne h loise must be sent away before i can take you home but she shall go i have decided i will turn her from my doors when will you do this asked the girl hartley clinched his teeth and bent his brows together to night he said resolutely i will send her away to night then said vivienne my answer is yes come for me when you will she looked into his eyes with a sweet sincere light in her own hartley could scarcely believe that her sur render was true it was so swift and complete promise me he said feelingly on your word and honour on my word and honour repeated vivienne softly at the door he turned and gazed at her happily but yet as one who scarcely trusts the foundations of his joy to morrow he said with a forefinger of reminder uplifted to morrow she repeated with a smile of truth and candour in an hour and forty minutes hartley stepped off the train at floralhurst a brisk walk of ten minutes brought him to the gate of a handsome two story cottage set upon a wide and well tended lawn halfway to the house he was met by a woman with jet black braided hair and flowing white summer gown who half strangled him without apparent cause when they stepped into the hall she said mamma s here the auto is coming for her in half an hour she came to dinner but there s no dinner i ve something to tell you said hartley i thought to break it to you gently but since your mother is here we may as well out with it he stooped and whispered something at her ear his wife screamed her mother came running into the hall the dark haired woman screamed again the joyful scream of a well beloved and petted woman oh mamma she cried ecstatically what do you think vivienne is coming to cook for us she is the one that stayed with the montgomerys a whole year and now billy dear she concluded you must go right down into the kitchen and discharge h loise she has been drunk again the whole day long sociology in serge and straw the season of irresponsibility is at hand come let us twine round our brows wreaths of poison ivy that is for idiocy and wander hand in hand with sociology in the summer fields likely as not the world is flat the wise men have tried to prove that it is round with indifferent success they pointed out to us a ship going to sea and bade us observe that at length the convexity of the earth hid from our view all but the vessel s topmast but we picked up a telescope and looked and saw the decks and hull again then the wise men said oh pshaw anyhow the variation of the intersection of the equator and the ecliptic proves it we could not see this through our telescope so we remained silent but it stands to reason that if the world were round the queues of china men would stand straight up from their heads instead of hanging down their backs as travellers assure us they do another hot weather corroboration of the flat theory is the fact that all of life as we know it moves in little unavailing circles more justly than to anything else it can be likened to the game of baseball crack we hit the ball and away we go if we earn a run in life we call it success we get back to the home plate and sit upon a bench if we are thrown out we walk back to the home plate and sit upon a bench the circumnavigators of the alleged globe may have sailed the rim of a watery circle back to the same port again the truly great return at the high tide of their attainments to the simplicity of a child the billionaire sits down at his mahogany to his bowl of bread and milk when you reach the end of your career just take down the sign goal and look at the other side of it you will find beginning point there it has been reversed while you were going around the track but this is humour and must be stopped let us get back to the serious questions that arise whenever sociology turns summer boarder you are invited to consider the scene of the story wild atlantic waves thundering against a wooded and rock bound shore in the greater city of new york the town of fishampton on the south shore of long island is noted for its clam fritters and the summer residence of the van plushvelts the van plushvelts have a hundred million dollars and their name is a household word with tradesmen and photographers on the fifteenth of june the van plushvelts boarded up the front door of their city house carefully deposited their cat on the sidewalk instructed the caretaker not to allow it to eat any of the ivy on the walls and whizzed away in a horse power to fishampton to stray alone the shade amaryllis not being in their class if a subscriber to the toadies magazine you have often you say you are not well you buy it at a news stand thinking that the newsdealer is not wise to you but he knows about it all he knows he knows i say that you have often seen in the toadies magazine pictures of the van plushvelts summer home so it will not be described here our business is with young haywood van plushvelt sixteen years old heir to the century of millions darling of the financial gods and great grandson of peter van plushvelt former owner of a particularly fine cabbage patch that has been ruined by an intrusive lot of downtown skyscrapers one afternoon young haywood van plushvelt strolled out between the granite gate posts of dolce far niente that s what they called the place and it was an improve ment on dolce far rockaway i can tell you haywood walked down into the village he was human after all and his prospective millions weighed upon him wealth had wreaked upon him its direfullest he was the product of private tutors even under his first hobby horse had tan bark been strewn he had been born with a gold spoon lobster fork and fish set in his mouth for which i hope later to submit justification i must ask your consideration of his haberdashery and tailoring young fortunatus was dressed in a neat suit of dark blue serge a neat white straw hat neat low cut tan shoes of the well known immaculate trade mark a neat narrow four in hand tie and carried a slender neat bamboo cane down persimmon street there s never tree north of hagerstown md came from the village smoky dodson fifteen and a half worst boy in fishampton smoky was dressed in a ragged red sweater wrecked and weather worn golf cap run over shoes and trousers of the serviceable brand dust clinging to the mois ture induced by free exercise darkened wide areas of his face smoky carried a baseball bat and a league ball that advertised itself in the rotundity of his trousers pocket haywood stopped and passed the time of day going to play ball he asked smoky s eyes and countenance confronted him with a frank blue and freckled scrutiny me he said with deadly mildness sure not can t you see i ve got a divin suit on i m goin up in a submarine balloon to catch butterflies with a two inch auger excuse me said haywood with the insulting polite ness of his caste for mistaking you for a gentleman i might have known better how might you have known better if you thought i was one said smoky unconsciously a logician by your appearances said haywood no gentle man is dirty ragged and a liar smoky hooted once like a ferry boat spat on his hand got a firm grip on his baseball bat and then dropped it against the fence say said he i knows you you re the pup that belongs in that swell private summer sanitarium for city guys over there i seen you come out of the gate you can t bluff nobody because you re rich and because you got on swell clothes arabella yah ragamuffin said hay wood smoky picked up a fence rail splinter and laid it on his shoulder dare you to knock it off he challenged i wouldn t soil my hands with you said the aristocrat fraid said smoky concisely youse city ducks ain t got the i sand i kin lick you with one hand i don t wish to have any trouble with you said haywood i asked you a civil question and you replied like a like a a cad wot s a cad asked smoky a cad is a disagreeable person answered haywood who lacks manners and doesn t know his place they sometimes play baseball i can tell you what a mollycoddle is said smoky it s a monkey dressed up by its mother and sent out too pick daisies on the lawn when you have the honour to refer to the members of my family said haywood with some dim ideas of a code in his mind you d better leave the ladies out of your remarks ho ladies mocked the rude one i say ladies i know what them rich women in the city does they drink cocktails and swear and give parties to gorillas the papers says so then haywood knew that it must be he took off his coat folded it neatly and laid it on the roadside grass placed his hat upon it and began to unknot his blue silk tie hadn t yer better ring fer yer maid arabella taunted smoky wot yer going to do go to bed i m going to give you a good trouncing said the hero he did not hesitate although the enemy was far beneath him socially he remembered that his father once thrashed a cabman and the papers gave it two col umns first page and the toadies magazine had a special article on upper cuts by the upper classes and ran new pictures of the van plushvelt country seat at fishampton wot s trouncing asked smoky suspiciously i don t want your old clothes i m no oh you mean to scrap my my i won t do a thing to mamma s pet criminy i d hate to be a hand laundered thing like you smoky waited with some awkwardness for his adversary to prepare for battle his own decks were always clear for action when he should spit upon the palm of his terrible right it was equivalent to you may fire now gridley the hated patrician advanced with his shirt sleeves neatly rolled up smoky waited in an attitude of ease expecting the affair to be conducted according to fishampton s rules of war these allowed combat to be prefaced by stigma recrimination epithet abuse and insult gradually increasing in emphasis and degree after a round of these you re anothers would come the chip knocked from the shoulder or the advance across the dare line drawn with a toe on the ground next light taps given and taken these also increasing in force until finally the blood was up and fists going at their best but haywood did not know fishampton s rules noblesse oblige kept a faint smile on his face as he walked slowly up to smoky and said going to play ball smoky quickly understood this to be a putting of the previous question giving him the chance to make practical apology by answering it with civility and relevance listen this time said he i m goin skatin on the river don t you see me automobile with chinese lanterns on it standin and waitin for me haywood knocked him down smoky felt wronged to thus deprive him of preliminary wrangle and objurgation was to send an armoured knight full tilt against a crashing lance without permitting him first to caracole around the list to the flourish of trumpets but he scrambled up and fell upon his foe head feet and fists the fight lasted one round of an hour and ten minutes it was lengthened until it was more like a war or a family feud than a fight haywood had learned some of the science of boxing and wrestling from his tutors but these he discarded for the more instinctive methods of battle handed down by the cave dwelling van plushvelts so when he found himself during the m l e seated upon the kicking and roaring smoky s chest he improved the opportunity by vigorously kneading hand fuls of sand and soil into his adversary s ears eyes and mouth and when smoky got the proper leg hold and turned him he fastened both hands in the plushvelt hair and pounded the plushvelt head against the lap of mother earth of course the strife was not incessantly active there were seasons when one sat upon the other holding him down while each blew like a grampus spat out the more inconveniently large sections of gravel and and strove to subdue the spirit of his opponent with a frightful and soul paralyzing glare at last it seemed that in the language of the ring their efforts lacked steam they broke away and each disappeared in a cloud as he brushed away the dust of the conflict as soon as his breath permitted haywood walked close to smoky and said going to play ball smoky looked pensively at the sky at his bat lying on the ground and at the leaguer rounding his pocket sure he said offhandedly the yellowjackets plays the long islands i m cap n of the long islands i guess i didn t mean to say you were ragged said haywood but you are dirty you know sure said smoky yer get that way knockin around say i don t believe them new york papers about ladies drinkin and havin monkeys dinin at the table with em i guess they re lies like they print about people eatin out of silver plates and ownin dogs that cost certainly said haywood what do you play on your team ketcher ever play any never in my life said haywood i ve never known any fellows except one or two of my cousins jer like to learn we re goin to have a practice game before the match wanter come along i ll put yer in left field and yer won t be long ketchin on i d like it bully said haywood i ve alway wanted to play baseball the ladies maids of new york and the families of western mine owners with social ambitions will remember well the sensation that was created by the report that the young multi millionaire haywood van plushvelt was playing ball with the village youths of fishampton it was conceded that the millennium of democracy had come reporters and photographers swarmed to the island the papers printed half page pictures of him as short stop stopping a hot grounder the toadies magazine got out a bat and ball number that covered the subject historically beginning with the vampire bat and ending with the patriarchs ball illustrated with interior views of the van plushvelt country seat ministers educators and sociologists everywhere hailed the event as the tocsin call that proclaimed the universal brotherhood of man one afternoon i was reclining under the trees near the shore at fishampton in the esteemed company of an eminent bald headed young sociologist by way of note it may be inserted that all sociologists are more or less bald and exactly thirty two look em over the sociologist was citing the van plushvelt case as the most important uplift symptom of a generation and as an excuse for his own existence immediately before us were the village baseball grounds and now came the sportive youth of fishampton and distributed themselves shouting about the diamond there said the sociologist pointing there is young van plushvelt i raised myself so far a cosycophant with mary ann and gazed young van plushvelt sat upon the ground he was dressed in a ragged red sweater wrecked and weather worn golf cap run over shoes and trousers of the ser viceable brand dust clinging to the moisture induced by free exercise darkened wide areas of his face that is he repeated the sociologist if he had said him i could have been less vindictive on a bench with an air sat the young millionaire s chum he was dressed in a neat suit of dark blue serge a neat white straw hat neat low cut tan shoes linen of the well known immaculate trade mark a neat narrow four in hand tie and carried a slender neat bamboo cane i laughed loudly and vulgarly what you want to do said i to the sociologist is to establish a reformatory for the logical vicious circle or else i ve got wheels it looks to me as if things are running round and round in circles instead of getting anywhere what do you mean asked the man of progress why look what he has done to smoky i replied you will always be a fool said my friend the sociologist getting up and walking away the ransom of red chief it looked like a good thing but wait till i tell you we were down south in alabama bill driscoll and myself when this kidnapping idea struck us it was as bill afterward expressed it during a moment of temporary mental apparition but we didn t find that out till later there was a town down there as flat as a flannel cake and called summit of course it contained inhabitants of as undeleterious and self satisfied a class of peasantry as ever clustered around a maypole bill and me had a joint capital of about six hundred dollars and we needed just two thousand dollars more to pull off a fraudulent town lot scheme in western illinois with we talked it over on the front steps of the hotel philoprogenitiveness says we is strong in semi rural communities therefore and for other reasons a kidnapping project ought to do better there than in the radius of newspapers that send reporters out in plain clothes to stir up talk about such things we knew that summit couldn t get after us with anything stronger than constables and maybe some lackadaisical blood hounds and a diatribe or two in the weekly farmers budget so it looked good we selected for our victim the only child of a prominent citizen named ebenezer dorset the father was respect able and tight a mortgage fancier and a stern upright collection plate passer and forecloser the kid was a boy of ten with bas relief freckles and hair the colour of the cover of the magazine you buy at the news stand when you want to catch a train bill and me figured that ebenezer would melt down for a ransom of two thousand dollars to a cent but wait till i tell you about two miles from summit was a little mountain covered with a dense cedar brake on the rear elevation of this mountain was a cave there we stored provisions one evening after sundown we drove in a buggy past old dorset s house the kid was in the street throw ing rocks at a kitten on the opposite fence hey little boy says bill would you like to have a bag of candy and a nice ride the boy catches bill neatly in the eye with a piece of brick that will cost the old man an extra five hundred dollars says bill climbing over the wheel that boy put up a fight like a welter weight cinnamon bear but at last we got him down in the bottom of the buggy and drove away we took him up to the cave and i hitched the horse in the cedar brake after dark i drove the buggy to the little village three miles away where we had hired it and walked back to the moun tain bill was pasting court plaster over the scratches and bruises on his features there was a burning behind the big rock at the entrance of the cave and the boy was watching a pot of boiling coffee with two buzzard tail feathers stuck in his red hair he points a stick at me when i come up and says ha cursed paleface do you dare to enter the camp of red chief the terror of the plains he s all right now says bill rolling up his trousers and examining some bruises on his shins we re playing indian we re making buffalo bill s show look like magic lantern views of palestine in the town hall i m old hank the trapper red chief s captive and i m to be scalped at daybreak by geronimo that kid can kick hard yes sir that boy seemed to be having the time of his life the fun of camping out in a cave had made him forget that he was a captive himself he immediately christened me snake eye the spy and announced that when his braves returned from the warpath i was to be broiled at the stake at the rising of the sun then we had supper and he filled his mouth full of bacon and bread and gravy and began to talk he made a during dinner speech something like this i like this fine i never camped out before but i had a pet possum once and i was nine last birthday i hate to go to school rats ate up sixteen of jimmy talbot s aunt s speckled hen s eggs are there any real indians in these woods i want some more gravy does the trees moving make the wind blow we had five puppies what makes your nose so red hank my father has lots of money are the stars hot i whipped ed walker twice saturday i don t like girls you dassent catch toads unless with a string do oxen make any noise why are oranges round have you got beds to sleep on in this cave amos murray has got six toes a parrot can talk but a monkey or a fish can t how many does it take to make twelve every few minutes he would remember that he was a pesky redskin and pick up his stick rifle and tiptoe to the mouth of the cave to rubber for the scouts of the hated paleface now and then he would let out a war whoop that made old hank the trapper shiver that boy had bill terrorized from the start red chief says i to the kid would you like to go home aw what for says he i don t have any fun at home i hate to go to school i like to camp out you won t take me back home again snake eye will you not right away says i we ll stay here in the cave a while all right says he that ll be fine i never had such fun in all my life we went to bed about eleven o clock we spread down some wide blankets and quilts and put red chief between us we weren t afraid he d run away he kept us awake for three hours jumping up and reaching for his rifle and screeching hist pard in mine and bill s ears as the fancied crackle of a twig or the rustle of a leaf revealed to his young imagination the stealthy approach of the outlaw band at last i fell into a troubled sleep and dreamed that i had been kidnapped and chained to a tree by a ferocious pirate with red hair just at daybreak i was awakened by a series of awful screams from bill they weren t yells or howls or shouts or whoops or yalps such as you d expect from a manly set of vocal organs they were simply indecent terrifying humiliating screams such as women emit when they see ghosts or caterpillars it s an awful thing to hear a strong desperate fat man scream incontinently in a cave at daybreak i jumped up to see what the matter was red chief was sitting on bill s chest with one hand twined in bill s hair in the other he had the sharp case knife we used for slicing bacon and he was industriously and realistically trying to take bill s scalp according to the sentence that had been pronounced upon him the evening before i got the knife away from the kid and made him lie down again but from that moment bill s spirit was broken he laid down on his side of the bed but he never closed an eye again in sleep as long as that boy was with us i dozed off for a while but along toward sun up i remem bered that red chief had said i was to be burned at the stake at the rising of the sun i wasn t nervous or afraid but i sat up and lit my pipe and leaned against a rock what you getting up so soon for sam asked bill me says i oh i got a kind of a pain in my shoulder i thought sitting up would rest it you re a liar says bill you re afraid you was to be burned at sunrise and you was afraid he d do it and he would too if he could find a match ain t it awful sam do you think anybody will pay out money to get a little imp like that back home sure said i a rowdy kid like that is just the kind that parents dote on now you and the chief get up and cook breakfast while i go up on the top of this mountain and reconnoitre i went up on the peak of the little mountain and ran my eye over the contiguous vicinity over toward summit i expected to see the sturdy yeomanry of the village armed with scythes and pitchforks beating the countryside for the dastardly kidnappers but what i saw was a peaceful landscape dotted with one man ploughing with a dun mule nobody was dragging the creek no couriers dashed hither and yon bringing tidings of no news to the distracted parents there was a sylvan attitude of somnolent sleepiness pervading that section of the external outward surface of alabama that lay exposed to my view perhaps says i to myself it has not yet been discov ered that the wolves have home away the tender lambkin from the fold heaven help the wolves says i and i went down the mountain to breakfast when i got to the cave i found bill backed up against the side of it breathing hard and the boy threatening to smash him with a rock half as big as a cocoanut he put a red hot boiled potato down my back explained bill and the mashed it with his foot and i boxed his ears have you got a gun about you sam i took the rock away from the boy and kind of patched up the argument i ll fix you says the kid to bill no man ever yet struck the red chief but what he got paid for it you better beware after breakfast the kid takes a piece of leather with strings wrapped around it out of his pocket and goes out side the cave unwinding it what s he up to now says bill anxiously you don t think he ll run away do you sam no fear of it says i he don t seem to be much of a home body but we ve got to fix up some plan about the ransom there don t seem to be much excitement around summit on account of his disappearance but maybe they haven t realized yet that he s gone his folks may think he s spending the night with aunt jane or one of the neighbours anyhow he ll be missed to day to night we must get a message to his father demanding the two thousand dollars for his return just then we heard a kind of war whoop such as david might have emitted when he knocked out the champion goliath it was a sling that red chief had pulled out of his pocket and he was whirling it around his head i dodged and heard a heavy thud and a kind of a sigh from bill like a horse gives out when you take his saddle off a niggerhead rock the size of an egg had caught bill just behind his left ear he loosened himself all over and fell in the fire across the frying pan of hot water for washing the dishes i dragged him out and poured cold water on his head for half an hour by and by bill sits up and feels behind his ear and says sam do you know who my favourite biblical character is take it easy says i you ll come to your senses presently king herod says he you won t go away and leave me here alone will you sam i went out and caught that boy and shook him until his freckles rattled if you don t behave says i i ll take you straight home now are you going to be good or not i was only funning says he sullenly i didn t mean to hurt old hank but what did he hit me for i ll behave snake eye if you won t send me home and if you ll let me play the black scout to day i don t know the game says i that s for you and mr bill to decide he s your playmate for the day i m going away for a while on business now you come in and make friends with him and say you are sorry for hurting him or home you go at once i made him and bill shake hands and then i took bill aside and told him i was going to poplar cove a little village three miles from the cave and find out what i could about how the kidnapping had been regarded in summit also i thought it best to send a peremptory letter to old man dorset that day demanding the ransom and dictating how it should be paid you know sam says bill i ve stood by you with out batting an eye in earthquakes fire and flood in poker games dynamite outrages police raids train robberies and cyclones i never lost my nerve yet till we kidnapped that two legged skyrocket of a kid he s got me going you won t leave me long with him will you sam i ll be back some time this afternoon says i you must keep the boy amused and quiet till i return and now we ll write the letter to old dorset bill and i got paper and pencil and worked on the letter while red chief with a blanket wrapped around him strutted up and down guarding the mouth of the cave bill begged me tearfully to make the ransom fifteen hundred dollars instead of two thousand i ain t attempting says he to decry the celebrated moral aspect of parental affection but we re dealing with humans and it ain t human for anybody to give up two thousand dollars for that forty pound chunk of freckled wildcat i m willing to take a chance at fifteen hundred dollars you can charge the difference up to me so to relieve bill i acceded and we collaborated a letter that ran this way ebenezer dorset esq we have your boy concealed in a place far from summit it is useless for you or the most skilful detectives to attempt to find him absolutely the only terms on which you can have him restored to you are these we demand fifteen hundred dollars in large bills for his return the money to be left at midnight to night at the same spot and in the same box as your reply as hereinafter described if you agree to these terms send your answer in writing by a solitary messenger to night at half past eight o clock after crossing owl creek on the road to poplar cove there are three large trees about a hundred yards apart close to the fence of the wheat field on the right hand side at the bottom of the fence post opposite the third tree will be found a small pasteboard box the messenger will place the answer in this box and return immediately to summit if you attempt any treachery or fail to comply with our demand as stated you will never see your boy again if you pay the money as demanded he will be returned to you safe and well within three hours these terms are final and if you do not accede to them no further coin munication will be attempted two desperate men i addressed this letter to dorset and put it in my pocket as i was about to start the kid comes up to me and says aw snake eye you said i could play the black scout while you was gone play it of course says i mr bill will play with you what kind of a game is it i m the black scout says red chief and i have to ride to the stockade to warn the settlers that the indians are coming i m tired of playing indian myself i want to be the black scout all right says i it sounds harmless to me i guess mr bill will help you foil the pesky savages what am i to do asks bill looking at the kid suspiciously you are the hoss says black scout get down on your hands and knees how can i ride to the stockade without a hoss you d better keep him interested said i till we get the scheme going loosen up bill gets down on his all fours and a look comes in his eye like a rabbit s when you catch it in a trap how far is it to the stockade kid he asks in a husky manner of voice ninety miles says the black scout and you have to hump yourself to get there on time whoa now the black scout jumps on bill s back and digs his heels in his side for heaven s sake says bill hurry back sam as soon as you can i wish we hadn t made the ransom more than a thousand say you quit kicking me or i ll get up and warm you good i walked over to poplar cove and sat around the post office and store talking with the chawbacons that came in to trade one whiskerando says that he hears summit is all upset on account of elder ebenezer dorset s boy having been lost or stolen that was all i wanted to know i bought some smoking tobacco referred casually to the price of black eyed peas posted my letter surreptitiously and came away the postmaster said the mail carrier would come by in an hour to take the mail on to summit when i got back to the cave bill and the boy were not to be found i explored the vicinity of the cave and risked a yodel or two but there was no response so i lighted my pipe and sat down on a mossy bank to await developments in about half an hour i heard the bushes

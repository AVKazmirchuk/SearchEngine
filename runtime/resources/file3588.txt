dreary land and she heard with pity his tales of suffering and trials in the desert among wild animals and fierce human kings and inside the castle the music died away and the lights grew dim and the villagers had long since gone to their homes and the knight and the princess still talked of old times and the moon climbed high in the eastern sky one day there came news from a country far to the west where lay the possessions of the knight the enemy had robbed him of his treasure driven away his cattle and he found it was best to hie him away and rescue his inheritance and goods he buckled on his sword and mounted his good war horse he rode to the postern gate of the castle to make his adieus to the princess when he told her he was going away to the wild western country to do battle with the heathen she grew pale and her eyes took on a look of such pain and fear that the knight s heart leaped and then sank in his bosom a his pride still kept him from speaking the words that might have made all well she bade him farewell in a low voice and tears even stood in leer eyes but what could she say or do the knight put spurs to his horse and dashed away over the hills without ever looking back and the princess stood looking over the gate at him till the last sight of his plume below the brow of the hill the knight was gone many suitors flocked about the princess mighty lords and barons of great wealth were at her feet and attended her every journey they came and offered themselves and their fortunes again and again but none of them found favor in her eyes will the princess listen to no one they began to say among themselves has she given her heart to some one who is not among us no one could say a great and mighty physician young and of wondrous power in his art telephoned to her every night if he might come down how his suit prospered no one could tell but he persevered with great and astonishing diligence a powerful baron who assisted in regulating the finances of the kingdom and who was a direct descendant of a great prince who was cast into a lion s den knelt at her feet a gay and lively lord who lived in a castle hung with ribbons and streamers and gay devices of all kinds with other nobles of like character prostrated themselves before her but she would listen to none of them the princess rode about in quiet ways in the cool evenings upon a gray palfrey alone and very quiet and she seemed to grow silent and thoughtful as time went on and no news came from the western wars and the knight came not back again to his daughter margaret toledo ohio oct

in maine for a weeks vacation say bill i m sending your ms back by mail to day i kept it a little longer after you sent for it because one of the mcclure phillips firm wanted to see it first everybody says it is full of good stuff but thinks it should be put in a more connected shape by some skilful writer who has been trained to that sort work it seems to me that you ought to do better with it out there than you could here if you can get somebody out there to publish it it ought to sell all right n y is a pretty cold proposition and it can t see as far as the oklahoma country when it is looking for sales how about trying indianapolis or chicago duffy told me about the other ms sent out by your friend abbott kind of a bum friendly trick wasn t it why don t you get arizona s hand done and send it on seems to me you could handle a short story all right my regards to mrs jennings and bro frank write some more still bill dear jennings n y may got your letter all right hope you ll follow it

advance a day or two gallot is in grand rapids maybe he will run over for a day or two in haste and truly yours w s p it was hard to get o henry to take an interest in his books he was always eager to be at the undone work to be writing a new story instead of collecting old ones this letter came from north carolina it shows how much thought he gave always to titles land o the sky monday my dear colonel steger as i wired you to day i like man about town for a title but i am sending in a few others for you to look at and if any other suits you better i m agreeable here they are in preferred order the venturers transfers merry go rounds babylonica brickdust from babel babes in the jungle if none of these hit you right let me know and i ll get busy again but i think man about town is about the right thing it gives the city idea without using the old hackneyed words i am going to write you a letter in a day or so touchin on and appertainin to other matters and topics i am still improving and feeling pretty good colonel bingham has put in a new ash sifter and expects you to come down and see that it works all right all send regards to you you seem to have made quite a hit down here for a yankee salutations and good wishes yours s p this letter was found unfinished among his papers after his death his publishers had discussed many times his writing of a novel but the following letter constitutes the only record of his own opinions in the matter the date is surely or my dear mr steger my idea is to write the story of a man an individual not a type but a man who at the same time i want to represent a human nature type if such a person could exist the story will teach no lesson inculcate no moral advance no theory i want it to be something that it won t or can t be but as near as i can make it the true record of a man s thoughts his description of his mischances and adventures his true opinions of life as he has seen it and his absolutely honest deductions comments and views upon the different phases of life that he passes through i do not remember ever to have read an autobiography a biography or a piece of fiction that told the truth of course i have read stuff such as rousseau and zola and george moore and various memoirs that were supposed to be window panes in their respective breasts but mostly all of them were either liars actors or posers of course i m not trying to belittle the greatness of their literary expression all of us have to be prevaricators hypocrites and liars every day of our lives otherwise the social structure would fall into pieces the first day we must act in one another s presence just as we must wear clothes it is for the best the trouble about writing the truth has been that the writers have kept in their minds one or another or all of three thoughts that made a handicap they were trying either to do a piece of immortal literature or to shock the public or to please editors some of them succeeded in all three but they did not write the truth most autobiographies are insincere from beginning to end about the only chance for the truth to be told is in fiction it is well understood that all the truth cannot be told in print but how about nothing but the truth that s what i want to do i want the man who is telling the story to tell it not as he would to a reading public or to a confessor but something in this way suppose he were marooned on an island in mid ocean with no hope of ever being rescued and in order to pass away some of the time he should tell a story to himself embodying his adventure and experiences and opinions having a certain respect for himself let us hope he would leave out the realism that he would have no chance of selling in the market he would omit the lies and self conscious poses and would turn out to his one auditor something real and true so as truth is not to be found in history autobiography press reports nor at the bottom of an h g wells let us hope that fiction may be the means of bringing out a few grains of it the hero of the story will be a man born and raised in a somnolent little southern town his education is about a common school one but he learns afterward from reading and life i m going to try to give him a style in narrative and speech the best i ve got in the shop i m going to take him through all the main phases of life wild adventure city society something of the under world and among many characteristic planes of the phases i want him to acquire all the sophistication that experience can give him and always preserve his individual honest human view and have him tell the truth about everything it is time to say now that by the truth i don t mean the objectionable stuff that so often masquerades under the name i mean true opinions a true estimate of all things as they seem to the hero if you find a word or a suggestive line or sentence in any of my copy you cut it out and deduct it from the royalties i want this man to be a man of natural intelligence of individual character absolutely open and broad minded and show how the creator of the earth has got him in a rat trap put him here willy nilly you know the omar verse and then i want to show what he does about it there is always the eternal question from the primal source what are you going to do about it please don t think for the half of a moment that the story is going to be anything of an autobiography i have a distinct character in my mind for the part and he does not at all here the letter ends he never finished it the story of holding up a train in sixes and sevens there appears an article entitled holding up a train now the facts were given to o henry by an old and dear friend who in his wild avenging youth had actually held up trains to day he is mr al jennings of oklahoma city okla a prominent attorney he has permitted the publication of two letters o henry wrote him the first outlining the story as he thought his friend jennings ought to write it and the second announcing that with o henry s revision the manuscript had been accepted from w s porter to al jennings september st year not given but probably dear pard in regard to that article i will give you my idea of what is wanted say we take for a title the art and humor of the hold up or something like that i would suggest that in writing you assume a character we have got to respect the conventions and delusions of the public to a certain extent an article written as you would naturally write it would be regarded as a fake and an imposition remember that the traditions must be preserved wherever they will not interfere with the truth write in as simple plain and unembellished a style as you know how make your sentences short put in as much realism and as many facts as possible where you want to express an opinion or comment on the matter do it as practically and plainly as you can give it life and the vitality of facts now i will give you a sort of general synopsis of my idea of course everything is subject to your own revision and change the article we will say is written by a typical train hoister one without your education and powers of expression bouquet but intelligent enough to convey his ideas from his standpoint not from john wanamaker s yet in order to please john we will have to assume a virtue that we do not possess comment on the moral side of the proposition as little as possible do not claim that holding up trains is the only business a gentleman would engage in and on the contrary do not depreciate a profession that is really only fnanciering with spurs on describe the facts and details all that part of the proceedings that the passenger sitting with his hands up in a pullman looking into the end of a tunnel in the hands of one of the performers does not see here is a rough draft of my idea begin abruptly without any philosophizing with your idea of the best times places and conditions for the hold up compare your opinions of this with those of others mention some poorly conceived attempts and failures of others giving your opinion why as far as possible refer to actual occurrences and incidents describe the manner of a hold up how many men is best where they are stationed how do they generally go into it nervous or joking or solemnly the details of stopping the train the duties of each man of the gang the behavior of the train crew and passengers here give as many brief odd and humorous incidents as you can think of your opinions on going through the passengers when is it done and when not done how is the boodle gotten at how does the express clerk generally take it anything done with the mail car under what circumstances will a train robber shoot a passenger or a train man suppose a man refuses to throw up his hands queer articles found on passengers a chance here for some imaginative work queer and laughable incidents of any kind refer whenever apropos to actual hold ups and facts concerning them of interest what could two or three brave and determined passengers do if they were to try why don t they try how long does it take to do the business does the train man ever stand in with the hold up best means of getting away how and when is the money divided how is it mostly spent best way to manoeuvre afterward how to get caught and how not to comment on the methods of officials who try to capture here s your chance to get even these ideas are some that occur to me casually you will of course have many far better i suggest that you make the article anywhere from to words get as much meat in it as you can and by the way stuff it full of western genuine slang not the eastern story paper kind get all the quaint cowboy expressions and terms of speech you can think of information is what we want clothed in the peculiar western style of the character we want to present the main idea is to be natural direct and concise i hope you will understand what i say i don t but try her a whack and send it along as soon as you can and let s see what we can do by the way mr everybody pays good prices i thought i would when i get your story put it into the shape my judgment decides upon and then send both your ms and mine to the magazine if he uses mine we ll whack up shares on the proceeds if he uses yours you get the check direct if he uses neither we are out only a few stamps sincerely your friend w s p and here is the letter telling his pard that the article had been bought by everybody s magazine this is dated pittsburg october th obviously the same year dear pard you re it i always told you you were a genius all you need is to succeed in order to make a success i enclose your letter which explains itself when you see your baby in print don t blame me if you find strange ear marks and brands on it i slashed it and cut it and added lots of stuff that never happened but i followed your facts and ideas and that is what made it valuable i ll think up some other idea for an article and we ll collaborate again some time eh i have all the work i can do and am selling it right along have averaged about per month since august st and yet i don t overwork don t think i ever will i commence about a m and generally knock off about or p m as soon as check mentioned in letter comes i ll send you your sheer of the boodle by the way please keep my nom de plume strictly to yourself i don t want any one to know just yet give my big regards to billy reason with him and try to convince him that we believe him to be pure merino and of more than average width with the kindest remembrances to yourself i remain your friend w s p at this time o henry was unknown and thought himself lucky to sell a story at any price strictly business more stories of the four million strictly business i suppose you know all about the stage and stage people you ve been touched with and by actors and you read the newspaper criticisms and the jokes in the weeklies about the rialto and the chorus girls and the long haired tragedians and i suppose that a condensed list of your ideas about the mysterious stageland would boil down to something like this leading ladies have five husbands paste diamonds and figures no better than your own madam if they weren t padded chorus girls are inseparable from peroxide panhards and pittsburg all shows walk back to new york on tan oxford and railroad ties irreproachable actresses reserve the comic landlady part for their mothers on broadway and their step aunts on the road kyrle bellew s real name is boyle o kelley the ravings of john mccullough in the phonograph were stolen from the first sale of the ellen terry memoirs joe weber is funnier than e h sothern but henry miller is getting older than he was all theatrical people on leaving the theatre at night drink champagne and eat lobsters until noon the next day after all the moving pictures have got the whole bunch pounded to a pulp now few of us know the real life of the stage people if we did the profession might be more overcrowded than it is we look askance at the players with an eye full of patronizing superiority and we go home and practise all sorts of elocution and gestures in front of our looking glasses latterly there has been much talk of the actor people in a new light it seems to have been divulged that instead of being motoring bacchanalias and diamond hungry loreleis they are businesslike folk students and ascetics with childer and homes and libraries owning real estate and conducting their private affairs in as orderly and unsensational a manner as any of us good citizens who are bound to the chariot wheels of the gas rent coal ice and wardmen whether the old or the new report of the sock and buskiners be the true one is a surmise that has no place here i offer you merely this little story of two strollers and for proof of its truth i can show you only the dark patch above the cast iron of the stage entrance door of keetor s old vaudeville theatre made there by the petulant push of gloved hands too impatient to finger the clumsy thumb latch and where i last saw cherry whisking through like a swallow into her nest on time to the minute as usual to dress for her act the vaudeville team of hart cherry was an inspiration but hart had been roaming through the eastern and western circuits for four years with a mixed up act comprising a monologue three lightning changes with songs a couple of imitations of celebrated imitators and a buck and wing dance that had drawn a glance of approval from the bass viol player in more than one house than which no performer ever received more satisfactory evidence of good work the greatest treat an actor can have is to witness the pitiful performance with which all other actors desecrate the stage in order to give himself this pleausre he will often forsake the sunniest broadway corner between thirty fourth and forty fourth to attend a matin ee offering by his less gifted brothers once during the lifetime of a minstrel joke one comes to scoff and remains to go through with that most difficult exercise of thespian muscles the audible contact of the palm of one hand against the palm of the other one afternoon bob hart presented his solvent serious well known vaudevillian face at the box office window of a rival attraction and got his d h coupon for an orchestra seat a b c and d glowed successively on the announcement spaces and passed into oblivion each plunging mr hart deeper into gloom others of the audience shrieked squirmed whistled and applauded but bob hart all the mustard and a whole show in himself sat with his face as long and his hands as far apart as a boy holding a hank of yarn for his grandmother to wind into a ball but when h came on the mustard suddenly sat up straight h was the happy alphabetical prognosticator of winona cherry in character songs and impersonations there were scarcely more than two bites to cherry but she delivered the merchandise tied with a pink cord and charged to the old man s account she first showed you a deliciously dewy and ginghamy country girl with a basket of property daisies who informed you ingenuously that there were other things to be learned at the old log school house besides cipherin and nouns especially when the teach er kept me in vanishing with a quick flirt of gingham apron strings she reappeared in considerably less than a trice as a fluffy parisienne so near does art bring the old red mill to the moulin rouge and then but you know the rest and so did bob hart but he saw somebody else he thought he saw that cherry was the only professional on the short order stage that he had seen who seemed exactly to fit the part of helen grimes in the sketch he had written and kept tucked away in the tray of his trunk of course bob hart as well as every other normal actor grocer newspaper man professor curb broker and farmer has a play tucked away somewhere they tuck em in trays of trunks trunks of trees desks haymows pigeonholes inside pockets safe deposit vaults handboxes and coal cellars waiting for mr frohman to call they belong among the fifty seven different kinds but bob hart s sketch was not destined to end in a pickle jar he called it mice will play he had kept it quiet and hidden away ever since he wrote it waiting to find a partner who fitted his conception of helen grimes and here was helen herself with all the innocent abandon the youth the sprightliness and the flawless stage art that his critical taste demanded after the act was over hart found the manager in the box office and got cherry s address at five the next afternoon he called at the musty old house in the west forties and sent up his professional card by daylight in a secular shirtwaist and plain voile skirt with her hair curbed and her sister of charity eyes winona cherry might have been playing the part of prudence wise the deacon s daughter in the great unwritten new england drama not yet entitled anything i know your act mr hart she said after she had looked over his card carefully what did you wish to see me about i saw you work last night said hart i ve written a sketch that i ve been saving up it s for two and i think you can do the other part i thought i d see you about it come in the parlor said miss cherry i ve been wishing for something of the sort i think i d like to act instead of doing turns bob hart drew his cherished mice will play from his pocket and read it to her read it again please said miss cherry and then she pointed out to him clearly how it could be improved by introducing a messenger instead of a telephone call and cutting the dialogue just before the climax while they were struggling with the pistol and by completely changing the lines and business of helen grimes at the point where her jealousy overcomes her hart yielded to all her strictures without argument she had at once put her finger on the sketch s weaker points that was her woman s intuition that he had lacked at the end of their talk hart was willing to stake the judgment experience and savings of his four years of vaudeville that mice will play would blossom into a perennial flower in the garden of the circuits miss cherry was slower to decide after many puckerings of her smooth young brow and tappings on her small white teeth with the end of a lead pencil she gave out her dictum mr hart said she i believe your sketch is going to win out that grimes part fits me like a shrinkable flannel after its first trip to a handless hand laundry i can make it stand out like the colonel of the forty fourth regiment at a little mothers bazaar and i ve seen you work i know what you can do with the other part but business is business how much do you get a week for the stunt you do now two hundred answered hart i get one hundred for mine said cherry that s about the natural discount for a woman but i live on it and put a few simoleons every week under the loose brick in the old kitchen hearth the stage is all right i love it but there s something else i love better that s a little country home some day with plymouth rock chickens and six ducks wandering around the yard now let me tell you mr hart i am strictly business if you want me to play the opposite part in your sketch i ll do it and i believe we can make it go and there s something else i want to say there s no nonsense in my make up i m on the level and i m on the stage for what it pays me just as other girls work in stores and offices i m going to save my money to keep me when i m past doing my stunts no old ladies home or retreat for imprudent actresses for me if you want to make this a business partnership mr hart with all nonsense cut out of it i m in on it i know something about vaudeville teams in general but this would have to be one in particular i want you to know that i m on the stage for what i can cart away from it every pay day in a little manila envelope with nicotine stains on it where the cashier has licked the flap it s kind of a hobby of mine to want to cravenette myself for plenty of rainy days in the future i want you to know just how i am i don t know what an all night restaurant looks like i drink only weak tea i never spoke to a man at a stage entrance in my life and i ve got money in five savings banks miss cherry said bob hart in his smooth serious tones you re in on your own terms i ve got strictly business pasted in my hat and stenciled on my make up box when i dream of nights i always see a five room bungalow on the north shore of long island with a jap cooking clam broth and duckling in the kitchen and me with the title deeds to the place in my pongee coat pocket swinging in a hammock on the side porch reading stanleys explorations into africa and nobody else around you never was interested in africa was you miss cherry not any said cherry what i m going to do with my money is to bank it you can get four per cent on deposits even at the salary i ve been earning i ve figured out that in ten years i d have an income of about a month just from the interest alone well i might invest some of the principal in a little business say trimming hats or a beauty parlor and make more well said hart you ve got the proper idea all right all right anyhow there are mighty few actors that amount to anything at all who couldn t fix themselves for the wet days to come if they d save their money instead of blowing it i m glad you ve got the correct business idea of it miss cherry i think the same way and i believe this sketch will more than double what both of us earn now when we get it shaped up the subsequent history of mice will play is the history of all successful writings for the stage hart cherry cut it pieced it remodeled it performed surgical operations on the dialogue and business changed the lines restored em added more cut em out renamed it gave it back the old name rewrote it substituted a dagger for the pistol restored the pistol put the sketch through all the known processes of condensation and improvement they rehearsed it by the old fashioned boardinghouse clock in the rarely used parlor until its warning click at five minutes to the hour would occur every time exactly half a second before the click of the unloaded revolver that helen grimes used in rehearsing the thrilling climax of the sketch yes that was a thriller and a piece of excellent work in the act a real caliber revolver was used loaded with a real cartridge helen grimes who is a western girl of decidedly buffalo billish skill and daring is tempestuously in love with frank desmond the private secretary and confidential prospective son in law of her father arapahoe grimes quarter million dollar cattle king owning a ranch that judging by the scenery is in either the bad lands or amagensett l i desmond in private life mr bob hart wears puttees and meadow brook hunt riding trousers and gives his address as new york leaving you to wonder why he comes to the bad lands or amagansett as the case may be and at the same time to conjecture mildly why a cattleman should want puttees about his ranch with a secretary in em well anyhow you know as well as i do that we all like that kind of play whether we admit it or not something along in between bluebeard jr and cymbeline played in the russian there were only two parts and a half in mice will play hart and cherry were the two of course and the half was a minor part always played by a stage hand who merely came in once in a tuxedo coat and a panic to announce that the house was surrounded by indians and to turn down the gas fire in the grate by the manager s orders there was another girl in the sketch a fifth avenue society swelless who was visiting the ranch and who had sirened jack valentine when he was a wealthy club man on lower third avenue before he lost his money this girl appeared on the stage only in the photographic state jack had her sarony stuck up on the mantel of the amagan of the bad lands droring room helen was jealous of course and now for the thriller old arapahoe grimes dies of angina pectoris one night so helen informs us in a stage ferryboat whisper over the footlights while only his secretary was present and that same day he was known to have had in cash in his ranch library just received for the sale of a drove of beeves in the east that accounts for the price we pay for steak the cash disappears at the same time jack valentine was the only person with the ranchman when he made his alleged croak gawd knows i love him but if he has done this deed you sabe don t you and then there are some mean things said about the fifth avenue girl who doesn t come on the stage and can we blame her with the vaudeville trust holding down prices until one actually must be buttoned in the back by a call boy maids cost so much but wait here s the climax helen grimes chaparralish as she can be is goaded beyond imprudence she convinces herself that jack valentine is not only a falsetto but a financier to lose at one fell swoop and a lover in riding trousers with angles in the sides like the variations on the chart of a typhoid fever patient is enough to make any perfect lady mad so then they stand in the ranch library which is furnished with mounted elk heads didn t the elks have a fish fry in amagensett once and the d enouement begins i know of no more interesting time in the run of a play unless it be when the prologue ends helen thinks jack has taken the money who else was there to take it the box office manager was at the front on his job the orchestra hadn t left their seats and no man could get past old jimmy the stage door man unless he could show a skye terrier or an automobile as a guarantee of eligibility goaded beyond imprudence as before said helen says to jack valentine robber and thief and worse yet stealer of trusting hearts this should be your fate with that out she whips of course the trusty caliber but i will be merciful goes on helen you shall live that will be your punishment i will show you how easily i could have sent you to the death that you deserve there is her picture on the mantel i will send through her more beautiful face the bullet that should have pierced your craven heart and she does it and there s no fake blank cartridges or assistants pulling strings helen fires the bullet the actual bullet goes through the face of the photograph and then strikes the hidden spring of the sliding panel in the wall and lo the panel slides and there is the missing in convincing stacks of currency and bags of gold it s great you know how it is cherry practised for two months at a target on the roof of her boarding house it took good shooting in the sketch she had to hit a brass disk only three inches in diameter covered by wall paper in the panel and she had to stand in exactly the same spot every night and the photo had to be in exactly the same spot and she had to shoot steady and true every time of course old arapahoe had tucked the funds away there in the secret place and of course jack hadn t taken anything except his salary which really might have come under the head of obtaining money under but that is neither here nor there and of course the new york girl was really engaged to a concrete house contractor in the bronx and necessarily jack and helen ended in a half nelson and there you are after hart and cherry had gotten mice will play flawless they had a try out at a vaudeville house that accommodates the sketch was a house wrecker it was one of those rare strokes of talent that inundates a theatre from the roof down the gallery wept and the orchestra seats being dressed for it swam in tears after the show the booking agents signed blank checks and pressed fountain pens upon hart and cherry five hundred dollars a week was what it panned out that night at bob hart took off his hat and bade cherry good night at her boarding house door mr hart said she thoughtfully come inside just a few minutes we ve got our chance now to make good and make money what we want to do is to cut expenses every cent we can and save all we can right said bob it s business with me you ve got your scheme for banking yours and i dream every night of that bungalow with the jap cook and nobody around to raise trouble anything to enlarge the net receipts will engage my attention come inside just a few minutes repeated cherry deeply thoughtful i ve got a proposition to make to you that will reduce our expenses a lot and help you work out your own future and help me work out mine and all on business principles mice will play had a tremendously successful run in new york for ten weeks rather neat for a vaudeville sketch and then it started on the circuits without following it it may be said that it was a solid drawing card for two years without a sign of abated popularity sam packard manager of one of keetor s new york houses said of hart cherry as square and high toned a little team as ever came over the circuit it s a pleasure to read their names on the booking list quiet hard workers no johnny and mabel nonsense on the job to the minute straight home after their act and each of em as gentlemanlike as a lady i don t expect to handle any attractions that give me less trouble or more respect for the profession and now after so much cracking of a nutshell here is the kernel of the story at the end of its second season mice will play came back to new york for another run at the roof gardens and summer theatres there was never any trouble in booking it at the top notch price bob hart had his bungalow nearly paid for and cherry had so many savings deposit bank books that she had begun to buy sectional bookcases on the instalment plan to hold them i tell you these things to assure you even if you can t believe it that many very many of the stage people are workers with abiding ambitions just the same as the man who wants to be president or the grocery clerk who wants a home in flatbush or a lady who is anxious to flop out of the count pan into the prince fire and i hope i may be allowed to say without chipping into the contribution basket that they often move in a mysterious way their wonders to perform but listen at the first performance of mice will play in new york at the westphalia no hams alluded to theatre winona cherry was nervous when she fired at the photograph of the eastern beauty on the mantel the bullet instead of penetrating the photo and then striking the disk went into the lower left side of bob hart s neck not expecting to get it there hart collapsed neatly while cherry fainted in a most artistic manner the audience surmising that they viewed a comedy instead of a tragedy in which the principals were married or reconciled applauded with great enjoyment the cool head who always graces such occasions rang the curtain down and two platoons of scene shifters respectively and more or less respectfully removed hart cherry from the stage the next turn went on and all went as merry as an alimony bell the stage hands found a young doctor at the stage entrance who was waiting for a patient with a decoction of am b ty roses the doctor examined hart carefully and laughed heartily no headlines for you old sport was his diagnosis if it had been two inches to the left it would have undermined the carotid artery as far as the red front drug store in flatbush and back again as it is you just get the property man to bind it up with a flounce torn from any one of the girls valenciennes and go home and get it dressed by the parlor floor practitioner on your block and you ll be all right excuse me i ve got a serious case outside to look after after that bob hart looked up and felt better and then to where he lay came vincente the tramp juggler great in his line vincente a solemn man from brattleboro vt named sam griggs at home sent toys and maple sugar home to two small daughters from every town he played vincente had moved on the same circuits with hart cherry and was their peripatetic friend bob said vincente in his serious way i m glad it s no worse the little lady is wild about you who asked hart cherry said the juggler we didn t know how bad you were hurt and we kept her away it s taking the manager and three girls to hold her it was an accident of course said hart cherry s all right she wasn t feeling in good trim or she couldn t have done it there s no hard feelings she s strictly business the doctor says i ll be on the job again in three days don t let her worry man said sam griggs severely puckering his old smooth lined face are you a chess automaton or a human pincushion cherry s crying her heart out for you calling bob bob every second with them holding her hands and keeping her from coming to you what s the matter with her asked hart with wide open eyes the sketch ll go on again in three days i m not hurt bad the doctor says she won t lose out half a week s salary i know it was an accident what s the matter with her you seem to be blind or a sort of a fool said vincente the girl loves you and is almost mad about your hurt what s the matter with you is she nothing to you i wish you could hear her call you loves me asked bob hart rising from the stack of scenery on which he lay cherry loves me why it s impossible i wish you could see her and hear her said griggs but man said bob hart sitting up it s impossible it s impossible i tell you i never dreamed of such a thing no human being said the tramp juggler could mistake it she s wild for love of you how have you been so blind but my god said bob hart rising to his feet it s too late it s too late i tell you sam it s too late it can t be you must be wrong it s impossible there s some mistake she s crying for you said the tramp juggler for love of you she s fighting three and calling your name so loud they don t dare to raise the curtain wake up man for love of me said bob hart with staring eyes don t i tell you it s too late it s too late man why cherry and i have been married two years the gold that glittered a story with a moral appended is like the bill of a mosquito it bores you and then injects a stinging drop to irritate your conscience therefore let us have the moral first and be done with it all is not gold that glitters but it is a wise child that keeps the stopper in his bottle of testing acid where broadway skirts the corner of the square presided over by

when alone and beset by evil she looked to be one of that old vassal class of the south voluble familiar loyal irrepressible her person pictured it fat neat aproned kerchiefed this sudden apparition spewed from the silent house reached the bottom of the steps as doctor james came opposite her brain transferring its energies from sound to sight she ceased her clamor and fixed her pop eyes upon the case the doctor carried bress de lawd was the benison the sight drew from her is you a doctor suh yes i am a physician said doctor james pausing den fo god s sake come and see mister chandler suh he

foot upon the step if you want me as a doctor as an auditor i m not open to engagements the negress preceded him into the house and up a flight of thickly carpeted stairs twice they came to dimly lighted branching hallways at the second one the now panting conductress turned down a hall stopping at a door and opening it i done brought de doctor miss amy doctor james entered the room and bowed slightly to a young lady standing by the side of a bed he set his medicine case upon a chair removed his overcoat throwing it over the case and the back of the chair an advanced with quiet self possession to the bedside there lay a man sprawling as he had fallen a man dressed richly in the prevailing mode with only his shoe removed lying relaxed and as still as the dead there emanated from doctor james an aura of calm force and reserve strength that was as manna in the desert to the weak and desolate among his patrons always had women especially been attracted by something in his sick room manner it was not the indulgent suavity of the fashionable healer but a manner of poise of sureness of ability to overcome fate of deference and protection and devotion there was an exploring magnetism in his steadfast luminous brown eves a latent authority in the impassive even priestly tranquillity of his smooth countenance that outwardly fitted him for the part of confidant and consoler sometimes at his first professional visit women would tell him where they hid their diamonds at night from the burglars with the ease of much practice doctor james s unroving eyes estimated the order and quality of the room s furnishings the appointments were rich and costly the same glance had secured cognizance of the lady s appearance she was small and scarcely past twenty her face possessed the title to a winsome prettiness now obscured by you would say rather a fixed melancholy than the more violent imprint of a sudden sorrow upon her forehead above one eyebrow was a livid bruise suffered the physician s eye told him within the past six hours doctor james s fingers went to the man s wrist his almost vocal eyes questioned the lady i am mrs chandler she responded speaking with the plaintive southern slur and intonation my husband was taken suddenly ill about ten minutes before you came he has had attacks of heart trouble before some of them were very bad his clothed state and the late hour seemed to prompt her to further explanation he had been out late to a supper i believe doctor james now turned his attention to his patient in whichever of his professions he happened to be engaged he was wont to honor the case or the job with his whole interest the sick man appeared to be about thirty his countenance bore a look of boldness and dissipation but was not without a symmetry of feature and the fine lines drawn by a taste and indulgence in humor that gave the redeeming touch there was an odor of spilled wine about his clothes the physician laid back his outer garments and then with a penknife slit the shirt front from collar to waist the obstacles cleared he laid his ear to the heart and listened intently mitral regurgitation he said softly when he rose the words ended with the rising inflection of uncertainty again he listened long and this time he said mitral insufficiency with the accent of an assured diagnosis madam he began in the reassuring tones that had so often allayed anxiety there is a probability as he slowly turned his head to face the lady he saw her fall white and swooning into the arms of the old negress po lamb po lamb has dey done killed aunt cindy s own blessed child may de lawd stroy wid his wrath dem what stole her away what break dat angel heart what left lift her feet said doctor james assisting to support the drooping form where is her room she must be put to bed in here suh the woman nodded her kerchiefed head toward a door dat s miss amy s room they carried her in there and laid her on the bed her pulse was faint but regular she passed from the swoon without recovering consciousness into a profound slumber she is quite exhausted said the physician sleep is a good remedy when she wakes give her a toddy with an egg in it if she can take it how did she get that bruise upon her forehead she done got a lick there suh de po lamb fell no suh the old woman s racial mutability swept her into a sudden flare of indignation old cindy ain t gwineter lie for dat debble he done it suh may de lawd wither de hand what dar now cindy promise her sweet lamb she ain t gwine tell miss amy got hurt suh on de head doctor james stepped to a stand where a handsome lamp burned and turned the flame low stay here with your mistress he ordered and keep quiet so she will sleep if she wakes give her the toddy if she grows any weaker let me know there is something strange about it dar s mo strange t ings dan dat round here began the negress but the physician hushed her in a seldom employed peremptory concentrated voice with which he had often allayed hysteria itself he returned to the other room closing the door softly behind him the man on the bed had not moved but his eyes were open his lips seemed to form words doctor james bent his head to listen the money the money was what they were whispering can you understand what i say asked the doctor speaking low but distinctly the head nodded slightly i am a physician sent for by your wife you are mr chandler i am told you are quite ill you must not excite or distress yourself at all the patient s eyes seemed to beckon to him the doctor stooped to catch the same faint words the money the twenty thousand dollars where is this money in the bank the eyes expressed a negative tell her the whisper was growing fainter the twenty thousand dollars her money his eyes wandered about the room you have placed this money somewhere doctor james s voice was toiling like a siren s to conjure the secret from the man s failing intelligence is it in this room he thought he saw a fluttering assent in the dimming eyes the pulse under his fingers was as fine and small as a silk thread there arose in doctor james s brain and heart the instincts of his other profession promptly as he acted in everything he decided to learn the whereabouts of this money and at the calculated and certain cost of a human life drawing from his pocket a little pad of prescription blanks he scribbled upon one of them a formula suited according to the best practice to the needs of the sufferer going to the door of the inner room he softly called the old woman gave her the prescription and bade her take it to some drug store and fetch the medicine when she had gone muttering to herself the doctor stepped to the bedside of the lady she still slept soundly her pulse was a little stronger her forehead was cool save where the inflammation of the bruise extended and a slight moisture covered it unless disturbed she would yet sleep for hours he found the key in the door and locked it after him when he returned doctor james looked at his watch he could call half an hour his own since before that time the old woman could scarcely return from her mission then he sought and found water in a pitcher and a glass tumbler opening his medicine case he took out the vial containing the nitroglycerine the oil as his brethren of the brace and bit term it one drop of the faint yellow thickish liquid he let fall in the tumbler he took out his silver hypodermic syringe case and screwed the needle into its place carefully measuring each modicum of water in the graduated glass barrel of the syringe he diluted the one drop with nearly half a tumbler of water two hours earlier that night doctor james had with that syringe injected the undiluted liquid into a hole drilled in the lock of a safe and had destroyed with one dull explosion the machinery that controlled the movement of the bolts he now purposed with the same means to shiver the prime machinery of a human being to rend its heart and each shock was for the sake of the money to follow the same means but in a different guise whereas that was the giant in its rude primary dynamic strength this was the courtier whose no less deadly arms were concealed by velvet and lace for the liquid in the tumbler and in the syringe that the physician carefully filled was now a solution of glonoin the most powerful heart stimulant known to medical science two ounces had riven the solid door of the iron safe with one fiftieth part of a minim he was now about to still forever the intricate mechanism of a human life but not immediately it was not so intended first there would be a quick increase of vitality a powerful impetus given to every organ and faculty the heart would respond bravely to the fatal spur the blood in the veins return more rapidly to its source but as doctor james well knew over stimulation in this form of heart disease means death as sure as by a rifle shot when the clogged arteries should suffer congestion from the increased flow of blood pumped into them by the power of the burglar s oil they would rapidly become no thoroughfare and the fountain of life would cease to flow the physician bared the chest of the unconscious chandler easily and skilfully he injected subcutaneously the contents of the syringe into the muscles of the region over the heart true to his neat habits in both professions he next carefully dried his needle and re inserted the fine wire that threaded it when not in use in three minutes chandler opened his eyes and spoke in a voice faint but audible inquiring who attended upon him doctor james again explained his presence there where is my wife asked the patient she is asleep from exhaustion and worry said the doctor i would not awaken her unless it isn t necessary chandler spoke with spaces between his words caused by his short breath that some demon was driving too fast she wouldn t thank you to disturb her on my account doctor james drew a chair to the bedside conversation must not be squandered a few minutes ago he began in the grave candid tones of his other profession you were trying to tell me something regarding some money i do not seek your confidence but it is my duty to advise you that anxiety and worry will work against your recovery if you have any communication to make about this to relieve your mind about this twenty thousand dollars i think was the amount you mentioned you would better do so chandler could not turn his head but he rolled his eyes in the direction of the speaker did i say where this money is no answered the physician i only inferred from your scarcely intelligible words that you felt a solicitude concerning its safety if it is in this room doctor james paused did he only seem to perceive a flicker of understanding a gleam of suspicion upon the ironical features of his patient had he seemed too eager had he said too much chandler s next words restored his confidence where should it be he gasped but in the safe there with his eyes he indicated a corner of the room where now for the first time the doctor perceived a small iron safe half concealed by the trailing end of a window curtain rising he took the sick man s wrist his pulse was beating in great throbs with ominous intervals between lift your arm said doctor james you know i can t move doctor the physician stepped swiftly to the hall door opened it and listened all was still without further circumvention he went to the safe and examined it of a primitive make and simple design it afforded little more security than protection against light fingered servants to his skill it was a mere toy a thing of straw and paste board the money was as good as in his hands with his clamps he could draw the knob punch the tumblers and open the door in two minutes perhaps in another way he might open it in one kneeling upon the floor he laid his ear to the combination plate and slowly turned the knob as he had surmised it was locked at only a day com upon one number his keen ear caught the faint warning click as the tumbler was disturbed he used the clue the handle turned he swung the door wide open the interior of the safe was bare not even a scrap of paper rested within the hollow iron cube doctor james rose to his feet and walked back to the bed a thick dew had formed upon the dying man s brow but there was a mocking grim smile on his lips and in his eyes i never saw it before he said painfully medicine and burglary wedded do you make the combination pay dear doctor than that situation afforded there was never a more rigorous test of doctor james s greatness trapped by the diabolic humor of his victim into a position both ridiculous and unsafe he maintained his dignity as well as his presence of mind taking out his watch he waited for the man to die you were just a shade too anxious about that money but it never was in any danger from you dear doctor it s safe perfectly safe it s all in the hands of the bookmakers twenty thousand amy s money i played it at the races lost every cent of it i ve been a pretty bad boy burglar excuse me doctor but i ve been a square sport i don t think i ever met such an eighteen carat rascal as you are doctor excuse me burglar in all my rounds is it contrary to the ethics of your gang burglar to give a victim excuse me patient a drink of water doctor james brought him a drink he could scarcely swallow it the reaction from the powerful drug was coming in regular intensifying waves but his moribund fancy must have one more grating fling gambler drunkard spendthrift i ve been those but a doctor burglar the physician indulged himself to but one reply to the other s caustic taunts bending low to catch chandler s fast crystallizing gaze he pointed to the sleeping lady s door with a gesture so stern and significant that the prostrate man half lifted his head with his remaining strength to see he saw nothing but he caught the cold words of the doctor the last sounds hie was to hear i never yet struck a woman it were vain to attempt to con such men there is no curriculum that can reckon with them in its ken thev are offshoots from the types whereof men say he will do this or he will do that we only know that they exist and that we can observe them and tell one another of their bare performances as children watch and speak of the marionettes yet it were a droll study in egoism to consider these two one an assassin and a robber standing above his victim the other baser in his offences if a lesser law breaker lying abhorred in the house of the wife he had persecuted spoiled and smitten one a tiger the other a dog wolf to consider each of them sickening at the foulness of the other and each flourishing out of the mire of his manifest guilt his own immaculate standard of conduct if not of honor the one retort of doctor james must have struck home to the other s remaining shreds of shame and manhood for it proved the coup de grace a deep blush suffused his face an ignominous rosa mortis the respiration ceased and with scarcely a tremor chandler expired close following upon his last breath came the negress bringing the medicine with a hand gently pressing upon the closed eyelids doctor james told her of the end not grief but a hereditary rapprochement with death in the abstract moved her to a dismal watery snuffling accompanied by her usual jeremiad dar now it s in de lawd s hands he am de jedge ob de transgressor and de suppo t of dem in distress he gwine hab suppo t us now cindy done paid out de last quarter fer dis bottle of physic and it nebber come to no use do i understand asked doctor james that mrs chandler has no money money suh you know what make miss amy fall down and so weak stahvation sub nothin to eat in dis house but some crumbly crackers in three days dat angel sell her finger rings and watch mont s ago dis fine house suh wid de red cyarpets and shiny bureaus it s all hired and de man talkin scan lous about de rent dat debble scuse me lawd he done in yo hands fer jedgment now he made way wid everything the physician s silence encouraged her to continue the history that he gleaned from cindy s disordered monologue was an old one of illusion wilfulness disaster cruelty and pride standing out from the blurred panorama of her gabble were little clear pictures an ideal home in the far south a quickly repented marriage an unhappy season full of wrongs and abuse and of late an inheritance of money that promised deliverance its seizure and waste by the dog wolf during a two months absence and his return in the midst of a scandalous carouse unobtruded but visible between every line ran a pure white thread through the smudged warp of the story the simple all enduring sublime love of the old negress following her mistress unswervingly through everything to the end when at last she paused the physician spoke asking if the house contained whiskey or liquor of any sort there was the old woman informed him half a bottle of brandy left in the sideboard by the dog wolf prepare a toddy as i told you said doctor james wake your mistress have her drink it and tell her what has happened some ten minutes afterward mrs chandler entered supported by old cindy s arm she appeared to be a little stronger since her sleep and the stimulant she had taken doctor james had covered with a sheet the form upon the bed the lady turned her mournful eyes once with a half frightened look toward it and pressed closer to her loyal protector her eyes were dry and bright sorrow seemed to have done its utmost with her the fount of tears was dried feeling itself paralyzed doctor james was standing near the table his overcoat donned his hat and medicine case in his hand his face was calm and impassive practice had inured him to the sight of human suffering his lambent brown eyes alone expressed a discreet professional sympathy he spoke kindly and briefly stating that as the hour was late and assistance no doubt difficult to procure he would himself send the proper persons to attend to the necessary finalities one matter in conclusion said the doctor pointing to the safe with its still wide open door your husband mrs chandler toward the end felt that he could not live and directed me to open that safe giving me the number upon which the combination is set in case you may need to use it you will remember that the number is forty one turn several times to the right then to the left once stop at forty one he would not permit me to waken you though he knew the end was near in that safe he said he had placed a sum of money not large but enough to enable you to carry out his last request that was that you should return to your old home and in after days when time shall have made it easier forgive his many sins against you he pointed to the table where lay an orderly pile of banknotes surmounted by two stacks of gold coins the money is there as he described it eight hundred and thirty dollars i beg to leave my card with you in case i can be of any service later on so he had thought of her and kindly at the last so late and yet the lie fanned into life one last spark of tenderness where she had thought all was turned to ashes and dust she cried aloud rob rob she turned and upon the ready bosom of her true servitor diluted her grief in relieving tears it is well to think also that in the years to follow the murderer s falsehood shone like a little star above the grave of love comforting her and gaining the forgiveness that is good in itself whether asked for or no hushed and soothed upon the dark bosom like a child by a crooning babbling sympathy at last she raised her head but the doctor was gone the marquis and miss sally originally published in everybody s magazine june without knowing it old bill bascom had the honor of being overtaken by fate the same day with the marquis of borodale the marquis lived in regent square london old bill lived on limping doe creek hardeman county texas the cataclysm that engulfed the marquis took the form of a bursting bubble known as the central and south american mahogany and caoutchouc monopoly old bill s nemesis was in the no less perilous shape of a band of civilized indian cattle thieves from the territory who ran off his entire herd of four hundred head and shot old bill dead as he trailed after them to even up the consequences of the two catastrophes the marquis as soon as he found that all he possessed would pay only fifteen shillings on the pound of his indebtedness shot himself old bill left a family of six motherless sons and daughters who found themselves without even a red steer left to eat or a red cent to buy one with the marquis left one son a young man who had come to the states and established a large and well stocked ranch in the panhandle of texas when this young man learned the news he mounted his pony and rode to town there he placed everything he owned except his horse saddle winchester and fifteen dollars in his pockets in the hands of his lawyers with instructions to sell and forward the proceeds to london to be applied upon the payment of his father s debts then he mounted his pony and rode southward one day arriving about the same time but by different trails two young chaps rode up to the diamond cross ranch on the little piedra and asked for work both were dressed neatly and sprucely in cowboy costume one was a straight set fellow with delicate handsome features short brown hair and smooth face sunburned to a golden brown the other applicant was stouter and broad shouldered with fresh red complexion somewhat freckled reddish curling hair and a rather plain face made attractive by laughing eyes and a pleasant mouth the superintendent of the diamond cross was of the opinion that he could give them work in fact word had reached him that morning that the camp cook a most important member of the outfit had straddled his broncho and departed being unable to withstand the fire of fun and practical jokes of which he was ex officio the legitimate target can either of you cook asked the superintendent i can said the reddish haired fellow promptly i ve cooked in camp quite a lot i m willing to take the job until you ve got something else to offer now that s the way i like to hear a man talk said the superintendent approvingly i ll give you a note to saunders and he ll put you to work thus the names of john bascom and charles norwood were added to the pay roll of the diamond cross the two left for the round up camp immediately after dinner their directions were simple but sufficient keep down the arroyo for fifteen miles till you get there both being strangers from afar young spirited and thus thrown together by chance for a long ride it is likely that the comradeship that afterward existed so strongly between them began that afternoon as they meandered along the little valley of the canada verda they reached their destination just after sunset the main camp of the round up was comfortably located on the bank of a long water hole under a fine mott of timber a number of small a tents pitched upon grassy spots and the big wall tent for provisions showed that the camp was intended to be occupied for a considerable length of time the round up had ridden in but a few moments before hungry and tired to a supperless camp the boys were engaged in an emulous display of anathemas supposed to fit the case of the absconding cook while they were unsaddling and hobbling their ponies the newcomer rode in and inquired for pink saunders the boss ol the round up came forth and was given the superintendent s note pink saunders though a boss during working hours was a humorist in camp where everybody from cook to superintendent is equal after reading the note he waved his hand toward the camp and shouted ceremoniously at the top of his voice gentlemen allow me to present to you the marquis and miss sally at the words both the new arrivals betray confusion the newly employed cook started with a surprised look on his face but immediately recollecting that miss sally is the generic name for the male cook in every west texas cow camp he recovered his composure with a grin at his own expense his companion showed little less discomposure even turning angrily with a bitten lip and reaching for his saddle pommel as if to remount his pony but miss sally touched his arm and said laughingly come now marquis that was quite a compliment from saunders it s that distinguished air of yours and aristocratic nose that made him call you that he began to unsaddle and the marquis restored to equanimity followed his example rolling up his sleeves miss sally sprang for the grub wagon shouting i m the new cook b thunder some of you chaps rustle a little wood for a fire and i ll guarantee you a hot square meal inside of thirty minutes miss sally s energy and good humor as he ransacked the grub wagon for coffee flour and bacon won the good opinion of the camp instantly and also in days following the marquis after becoming better acquainted proved to be a cheerful pleasant fellow always a little reserved and taking no part in the rough camp frolics but the boys gradually came to respect this reserve which fitted the title saunders had given him and even to like him for it saunders had assigned him to a place holding the herd during the cuttings he proved to be a skilful rider and as good with the lariat or in the branding pen as most of them the marquis and miss sally grew to be quite close comrades after supper was over and everything cleaned up you would generally find them together miss sally smoking his brier root pipe and the marquis plaiting a quirt or scraping rawhide for a new pair of hobbles the superintendent did not forget his promise to keep an eye on the cook several times when visiting the camp he held long talks with him he seemed to have taken a fancy to miss sally one afternoon he rode up on his way back to the ranch from a tour of the camps and said to him there ll be a man here in the morning to take your place as soon as he shows up you come to the ranch i want you to take charge of the ranch accounts and correspondence i want somebody that i can depend upon to keep things straight when i m away the wages ll be all right the diamond cross ll hold its end up with a man who ll look after its interests all right said miss sally as quietly as if he had expected the notice all along any objections to my bringing my wife down to the ranch you married said the superintendent frowning a little you didn t mention it when we were talking because i m not said the cook but i d like to be thought i d wait till i got a job under roof i couldn t ask her to live in a cow camp right agreed the superintendent a camp isn t quite the place for a married man but well there s plenty of room at the house and if you suit us as well as i think you will you can afford it you write to her to come on all right said miss sally again i ll ride in as soon as i am relieved to morrow it was a rather chilly night and after supper the cow punchers were lounging about a big fire of dried mesquite chunks their usual exchange of jokes and repartee had dwindled almost to silence but silence in a cow camp generally betokens the brewing of mischief miss sally and the marquis were seated upon a log discussing the relative merits of the lengthened or shortened stirrup in long distance riding the marquis arose presently and went to a tree near by to examine some strips of rawhide he was seasoning for making a lariat just as he left a little puff of wind blew some scraps of tobacco from a cigarette that dry creek smithers was rolling into miss sally s eyes while the cook was rubbing at them with tears flowing phonograph davis so called on account of his strident voice arose and began a speech fellers and citizens i desire to perpound a interrogatory what is the most grievous spectacle what the human mind can contemplate a volley of answers responded to his question a busted flush a maverick when you ain t got your branding iron yourself the hole in the end of some other feller s gun shet up you ignoramuses said old taller the fat cow puncher phony knows what it is he s waitin for to tell us no fellers and citizens continued phonograph them spectacles you ve e numerated air shore grievious and way up yonder close to the so lution but they ain t it the most grievious spectacle air that he pointed to miss sally who was still rubbing his streaming eyes a trustin and a in veegled female a weepin tears on account of her heart bein busted by a false deceiver air we men or air we catamounts to gaze upon the blightin of our miss sally s affections by a a risto crat which has come among us with his superior beauty and his glitterin title to give the weeps to the lovely critter we air bound to pertect air we goin to act like men or air we goin to keep on eaten soggy chuck from her cryin so plentiful over the bread pan it s a gallopin shame said dry creek with a sniffle it ain t human i ve noticed the varmint a palaverin round her frequent and him a marquis ain t that a title phony it s somethin like a king the brushy creek kid hastened to explain only lower in the deck guess it comes in between the jack and the ten spot don t miscontruct me went on phonograph as undervaluatin the a ristocrats some of em air proper people and can travel right along with the watson boys i ve herded some with em myself i ve viewed the elephant with the mayor of fort worth and i ve listened to the owl with the gen ral passenger agent of the katy and they can keep up with the percession from where you laid the chunk but when a marquis monkeys with the innocent affections of a cook lady may i inquire what the case seems to call for the leathers shouted dry creek smithers you hearn er charity was the kid s form of corroboration we ve got your company assented the cow punchers in chorus before the marquis realized their intention two of them seized him by each arm and led him up to the log phonograph davis self appointed to carry out the sentence stood ready with a pair of stout leather leggings in his hands it was the first time they had ever laid hands on the marquis during their somewhat rude sports what are you up to he asked indignantly with flashing eyes go easy marquis whispered rube fellows one of the boys that held him it s all in fun take it good natured and they ll let you off light they re only goin to stretch you over the log and tan you eight or ten times with the leggin s twon t hurt much the marquis with an exclamation of anger his white teeth gleaming suddenly exhibited a surprising strength he wrenched with his arms so violently that the four men were swayed and dragged many yards from the log a cry of anger escaped him and then miss sally his eyes cleared of the tobacco saw and he immediately mixed with the struggling group but at that moment a loud hallo rang in their ears and a buckboard drawn by a team of galloping mustangs spun into the campfire s circle of light every man turned to look and what they saw drove from their minds all thoughts of carrying out phonograph davis s rather time worn contribution to the evening s amusement bigger game than the marquis was at hand and his captors released him and stood staring at the approaching victim the buckboard and team belonged to sam holly a cattleman from the big muddy sam was driving and with him was a stout smooth faced man wearing a frock coat and a high silk hat that was the county judge mr dave hackett candidate for reelection sam was escorting him about the county among the camps to shake up the sovereign voters the men got out hitched the team to a mesquite and walked toward the fire instantly every man in camp except the marquis miss sally and pink saunders who had to play host uttered a frightful yell of assumed terror and fled on all sides into the darkness heavens alive exclaimed hackett are we as ugly as that how do you do mr saunders glad to see you again what are you doing to my hat holly i was afraid of this hat said sam holly meditatively he had taken the hat from hackett s head and was holding it in his hand looking dubiously around at the shadows beyond the firelight where now absolute stillness reigned what do you think saunders pink grinned better elevate it some he said in the tone of one giving disinterested advice the light ain t none too good i wouldn t want it on my head holly stepped upon the hub of a hind wheel of the grub wagon and hung the hat upon a limb of a live oak scarcely had his foot touched the ground when the crash of a dozen six shooters split the air and the hat fell to the ground riddled with bullets a hissing noise was heard as if from a score of rattlesnakes and now the cow punchers emerged on all sides from the darkness stepping high with ludicrously exaggerated caution and hist ing to one another to observe the utmost prudence in approaching they formed a solemn wide circle about the hat gazing at it in manifest alarm and seized every few moments by little stampedes of panicky flight it s the varmint said one in awed tones that flits up and down in the low grounds at night saying willie wallo it s the venomous kypootum proclaimed another it stings after it s dead and hollers after it s buried it s the chief of the hairy tribe said phonograph davis but it s stone dead now boys don t you believe it demurred dry creek it s only possumin it s the dreaded highgollacum fantod from the forest there s only one way to destroy its life he led forward old taller the pound cow puncher old taller placed the hat upright on the ground and solemnly sat upon it crushing it as flat as a pancake hackett had viewed these proceedings with wide open eyes sam holly saw that his anger was rising and said to him here s where you win or lose judge there are sixty votes on the diamond cross the boys are trying your mettle take it as a joke and i don t think you ll regret it and hackett saw the point and rose to the occasion advancing to where the slayers of the wild beast were standing above its remains and declaring it to be at last defunct he said with deep earnestness boys i must thank you for this gallant rescue while driving through the arroyo that cruel monster that you have so fearlessly and repeatedly slaughtered sprang upon us from the tree tops to you i shall consider that i owe my life and also i hope reelection to the office for which i am again a candidate allow me to hand you my card the cow punchers always so sober faced while engaged in their monkey shines relaxed into a grin of approval but phonograph davis his appetite for fun not yet appeased had something more up his sleeve pardner he said addressing hackett with grave severity many a camp would be down on you for turnin loose a pernicious varmint like that in it but bein as we all escaped without loss of life we ll overlook it you can play square with us if you ll do it how s that asked hackett suspiciously you re authorized to perform the sacred rights and lefts of mattermony air you not well yes replied hackett a marriage ceremony conducted by me would be legal a wrong air to be righted in this here camp said phonograpby virtuously a a ristocrat have slighted a umble but beautchoos female wat s pinin for his affections it s the jooty of the camp to drag forth the haughty descendant of a hundred or maybe a hundred and twenty five earls even so at the p int of a lariat and jine him to the weepin lady fellows roundup miss sally and the marquis there s goin to be a weddin this whim of phonograph s was received with whoops of appreciation the cow punchers started to apprehend the principals of the proposed ceremony kindly prompt me said hackett wiping his forehead though the night was cool how far this thing is to be carried and might i expect any further portions of my raiment to be mistaken for wild animals and killed the boys are livelier than usual to night said saunders the ones they are talking about marrying are two of the boys a herd rider and the cook it s another joke you and sam will have to sleep here to night anyway p rhaps you d better see em through with it maybe they ll quiet down after that the matchmakers found miss sally seated on the tongue of the grub wagon calmly smoking his pipe the marquis was leaning idly against one of the trees under which the supply tent was pitched into this tent they were both hustled and phonograph as master of ceremonies gave orders for the preparations you dry creek and jimmy and ben and taller hump yourselves to the wildwood and rustle flowers for the blow out mesquite ll do and get that spanish dagger blossom at the corner of the horse corral for the bride to pack you limpy get out that red and yaller blanket of your n for miss sally s skyirt marquis you ll do thout fixin nobody don t ever look at the groom during their absurd preparation the two principals were left alone for a few moments in the tent the marquis suddenly showed wild perturbation this foolishness must not go on he said turning to miss sally a face white in the light of the lantern hanging to the ridge pole why not said the cook with an amused smile it s fun for the boys and they ve always let you off pretty light in their frolics i don t mind it but you don t understand persisted the marquis pleadingly that man is county judge and his acts are binding i can t oh you don t know the cook stepped forward and took the marquis s hands sally bascom he said i know you know

bride and groom the cook wore the gorgeous navajo blanket tied around his waist and carried in one band the waxen white spanish dagger blossom as large as a peck measure and weighing fifteen pounds his hat was ornamented with mesquite branches and yellow ratama blooms a resurrected mosquito bar served as a veil after them stumbled phonograph davis in the character of the bride s father weeping into a saddle blanket with sobs that could be heard a mile away the cow punchers followed by twos loudly commenting upon the bride s appearance in a supposed imitation of the audiences at fashionable weddings hackett rose as the procession halted before him and after a little lecture upon matrimony asked what are your names sally and charles answered the cook join hands charles and sally perhaps there never was a stranger wedding for wedding it was though only two of those present knew it when the ceremony was over the cow punchers gave one yell of congratulation and immediately abandoned their foolery for the night blankets were unrolled and sleep became the paramount question the cook divested of his decorations and the marquis lingered for a moment in the shadow of the grub wagon the marquis leaned her head against his shoulder i didn t know what else to do she was saying father was gone and we kids had to rustle i had helped him so much with the cattle that i thought i d turn cowboy there wasn t anything else i could make a living at i wasn t much stuck on it though after i got here and i d have left only only what you know tell me something when did you first what made

crooked streets i didn t intend to call upon you twice but i guess i got tangled up excuse me he draws his collar higher and moves out slowly he stops under an electric light at the corner and juggles absorbedly with three or four little pasteboard boxes thirty six he announces to himself more than plenty for a gray mist had swept upon santone that night an opaque terror that laid a hand to the throat of each of the city s guests it was computed that three thousand invalids were hibernating in the town they had come from far and wide for here among these contracted river sliced streets the goddess ozone has elected to linger purest atmosphere sir on earth you might think from the river winding through our town that we are malarial but no sir repeated experiments made both by the government and local experts show that our air contains nothing deleterious nothing but ozone sir pure ozone litmus paper tests made all along the river show but you can read it all in the prospectuses or the santonian will recite it for you word by word we may achieve climate but weather is thrust upon us santone then cannot be blamed for this cold gray fog that came and kissed the lips of the three thousand and then delivered them to the cross that night the tubercles whose ravages hope holds in check multiplied the writhing fingers of the pale mist did not go thence bloodless many of the wooers of ozone capitulated with the enemy that night turning their faces to the wall in that dumb isolated apathy that so terrifies their watchers on the red stream of hemorrhagia a few souls drifted away leaving behind pathetic heaps white and chill as the fog itself two or three came to view this atmospheric wraith as the ghost of impossible joys sent to whisper to them of the egregious folly it is to inhale breath into the lungs only to exhale it again and these used whatever came handy to their relief pistols gas or the beneficent muriate the purchaser of the morphia wanders into the fog and at length finds himself upon a little iron bridge one of the score or more in the heart of the city under which the small tortuous river flows he leans on the rail and gasps for here the mist has concentrated lying like a foot pad to garrote such of the three thousand as creep that way the iron bridge guys rattle to the strain of his cough a mocking phthisical rattle seeming to say to him clickety clack just a little rusty cold sir but not from our river litmus paper all along the banks and nothing but ozone clacket y clack the memphis man at last recovers sufficiently to be aware of another overcoated man ten feet away leaning on the rail and just coming out of a paroxysm there is a freemasonry among the three thousand that does away with formalities and introductions a cough is your card a hemorrhage a letter of credit the memphis man being nearer recovered speaks first goodall memphis pulmonary tuberculosis guess last stages the three thousand

get lost here in two minutes you said something about a drink says goodall a few minutes later they line up at a glittering bar and hang upon the arm rest the bartender blond heavy well groomed sets out their drinks instantly perceiving that he serves two of the three thousand he observes that one is a middle aged man well dressed with a lined and sunken face the other a mere boy who is chiefly eyes and overcoat disguising well the tedium begotten by many repetitions the server of drinks begins to chant the sanitary saga of santone rather a moist night gentlemen for our town a little fog from our river but nothing to hurt repeated tests damn your litmus papers gasps toledo without any personal offense intended we ve beard of em before let em turn red white and blue what we want is a repeated test of that whiskey come again i paid for the last round goodall of memphis the bottle oscillates from one to the other continues to do so and is not removed from the counter the bartender sees two emaciated invalids dispose of enough kentucky belle to floor a dozen cowboys without displaying any emotion save a sad and contemplative interest in the peregrinations of the bottle so he is moved to manifest a solicitude as to the consequences not on your uncle mark hanna responds toledo will we get drunk we ve been vaccinated with whiskey and cod liver oil what would send you to the police station only gives us a thirst s s set out another bottle it is slow work trying to meet death by that route some quicker way must be found they leave the saloon and plunge again into the mist the sidewalks are mere flanges at the base of the houses the street a cold ravine the fog filling it like a freshet not far away is the mexican quarter conducted as if by wires along the heavy air comes a guitar s tinkle and the demoralizing voice of some senorita singing en las tardes sombrillos del invierro en el prado a marar me reclino y maldigo mi fausto destino una vida la mas infeliz the words of it they do not understand neither toledo nor memphis but words are the least important things in life the music tears the breasts of the seekers after nepenthe inciting toledo to remark those kids of mine i wonder by god mr goodall of memphis we had too little of that whiskey no slow music in mine if you please it makes you disremember to forget hurd of toledo here pulls out his watch and

corner and shuffles away casting off thus easily the ties of acquaintanceship as the moribund do the season of dissolution being man s supreme hour of egoism and selfishness but he turns and calls back through the fog to the other i say goodall of memphis if you get there before i do tell em hurd s a comin too hurd of t leder ah hia thus goodall s tempter deserts him that youth un complaining and uncaring takes a spell at coughing and recovered wanders desultorily on down the street the name of which he neither knows nor recks at a certain point he perceives swinging doors and hears filtering between them a noise of wind and string instruments two men enter from the street as he arrives and he follows them in there is a kind of ante chamber plentifully set with palms and cactuses and oleanders at little marble topped tables some people sit while soft shod attendants bring the beer all is orderly clean melancholy gay of the german method of pleasure at his right is the foot of a stairway a man there holds out his hand goodall extends his full of silver the man selects therefrom a coin goodall goes upstairs and sees there two galleries extending along the sides of a concert hall which he now perceives to lie below and beyond the anteroom he first entered these galleries are divided into boxes or stalls which bestow with the aid of hanging lace curtains a certain privacy upon their occupants passing with aimless feet down the aisle contiguous to these saucy and discreet compartments he is half checked by the sight in one of them of a young woman alone and seated in an attitude of reflection this young woman becomes aware of his approach a smile from her brings him to a standstill and her subsequent invitation draws him though hesitating to the other chair in the box a little table between them goodall is only nineteen there are some whom when the terrible god phthisis wishes to destroy be first makes beautiful and the boy is one of these his face is wax and an awful pulchritude is born of the menacing flame in his cheeks his eyes reflect an unearthly vista engendered by the certainty of his doom as it is forbidden man to guess accurately concerning his fate it is inevitable that he shall tremble at the slightest lifting of the veil the young woman is well dressed and exhibits a beauty of distinctly feminine and tender sort an eve like comeliness that scarcely seems predestined to fade it is immaterial the steps by which the two mount to a certain plane of good understanding they are short and few as befits the occasion a button against the

descendant of the lorelei so the waiter brings the brew effervescent icy greenish golden the orchestra on the stage is playing oh rachel the youngsters have exchanged a good bit of information she calls him walter and he calls her miss rosa goodall s tongue is loosened and he has told her everything about himself about his home in tennessee the old pillared mansion under the oaks the stables the hunting the friends he has down to the chickens and the box bushes bordering the walks about his coming south for the climate hoping to escape the hereditary foe of his family all about his three months on a ranch the deer hunts the rattlers and the rollicking in the cow camps then of his advent to santone where he had indirectly learned from a great specialist that his life s calendar probably contains but two more leaves and then of this death white choking night which has come and strangled his fortitude and sent him out to seek a port amid its depressing billows my weekly letter from home failed to come he told her and i was pretty blue i knew i had to go before long and i was tired of waiting i went out and bought morphine at every drug store where they would sell me a few tablets i got thirty six quarter grains and was going back to my room and take them but i met a queer fellow on a bridge who had a new idea goodall fillips a little pasteboard

nueces have much trouble corralling them i asked for here was the meat that my hunger for epics craved some said buck and then during a little pause his thoughts stampeded off the trail it s kind of queer about women he went on and the place they re supposed to occupy in botany if i was asked to classify them i d say they was a human loco weed ever see a bronc that had been chewing loco ride him up to a puddle of water two feet wide and he ll give a snort and fall back on you it looks as big as the mississippi river to him next trip he d walk into a canon a thousand feet deep thinking it was a prairie dog hole same way with a married man i was thinking of perry rountree that used to be my sidekicker before he committed matrimony in them days me and perry hated indisturbances of any kind we roamed around considerable stirring up the echoes and making em attend to business why when me and perry wanted to have some fun in a town it was a picnic for the census takers they just counted the marshal s posse that it took to subdue us and there was your population but then there came along this mariana goodnight girl and looked at perry sideways and he was all bridle wise and saddle broke before you could skin a yearling i wasn t even asked to the wedding i reckon the bride had my pedigree and the front elevation of my habits all mapped out and she decided that perry would trot better in double harness without any unconverted mustang like buck caperton whickering around on the matrimonial range so it was six months before i saw perry again one day i was passing on the edge of town and i see something like a man in a little yard by a little house with a sprinkling pot squirting water on a rose bush seemed to me i d seen something like it before and i stopped at the gate trying to figure out its brands twas not perry rountree but twas the kind of a curdled jellyfish matrimony had made out of him homicide was what that mariana had perpetrated he was looking well enough but he had on a white collar and shoes and you could tell in a minute that he d speak polite and pay taxes and stick his little finger out while drinking just like a sheep man or a citizen great skyrockets but i hated to see perry all corrupted and willie ized like that he came out to the gate and shook hands and i says with scorn and speaking like a paroquet with the pip beg pardon mr rountree i believe seems to me i sagatiated in your associations once if i am not mistaken oh go to the devil buck says perry polite as i was afraid he d be well then says i you poor contaminated adjunct of a sprinkling pot and degraded household pet what did you go and do it for look at you all decent and unriotous and only fit to sit on juries and mend the wood house door you was a man once i have hostility for all such acts why don t you go in the house and count the tidies or set the clock and not stand out here in the atmosphere a jack rabbit might come along and bite you now buck says perry speaking mild and some sorrowful you don t understand a married man has got to be different he feels different from a tough old cloudburst like you it s sinful to waste time pulling up towns just to look at their roots and playing faro and looking upon red liquor and such restless policies as them there was a time i says and i expect i sighed when i mentioned it when a certain domesticated little mary s lamb i could name was some instructed himself in the line of pernicious sprightliness i never expected perry to see you reduced down from a full grown pestilence to such a frivolous fraction of a man why says i you ve got a necktie on and you speak a senseless kind of indoor drivel that reminds me of a storekeeper or a lady you look to me like you might tote an umbrella and wear suspenders and go home of nights the little woman says perry has made some improvements i believe you can t understand buck i haven t been away from the house at night since we was married we talked on a while me and perry and as sure as i live that man interrupted me in the middle of my talk to tell me about six tomato plants he had growing in his garden shoved his agricultural degradation right up under my nose while i was telling him about the fun we had tarring and feathering that faro dealer at california pete s layout but by and by perry shows a flicker of sense buck says he i ll have to admit that it is a little dull at times not that i m not perfectly happy with the little woman but a man seems to require some excitement now and then now i ll tell you mariana s gone visiting this afternoon and she won t be home till seven o clock neither of us ever stays out a minute after that time unless we are together now i m glad you came along buck says perry for i m feeling just like having one more rip roaring razoo with you for the sake of old times what you say to us putting in the afternoon having fun i d like it fine says perry i slapped that old captive range rider half across his little garden get your hat

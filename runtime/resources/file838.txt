what it will be shall i be a shepherdess with a watteau hat and a crook to keep the bad wolves from the lambs or a typical western ranch girl with short hair like the pictures of her in the sunday papers i think the latter and they ll have my picture too with the wild cats i ve slain single handed hanging from my saddle horn from the four hundred to the flocks is the way they ll headline it and they ll print photographs of the old van dresser mansion and the church where i was married they won t have my picture but they ll get an artist to draw it i ll be wild and woolly and i ll grow my own wool octavia aunt ellen condensed into the one word all the protests she was unable to utter don t say a word auntie i m going i ll see the sky at night fit down on the world like a big butter dish cover and i ll make friends again with the stars that i haven t had a chat with since i was a wee child i wish to go i m tired of all this i m glad i haven t any money i could bless colonel beaupree for that ranch and forgive him for all his bubbles what if the life will be rough and lonely i i deserve it i shut my heart to everything except that miserable ambition i oh i wish to go away and forget forget octavia swerved suddenly to her knees laid her flushed face in her aunt s lap and shook with turbulent sobs aunt ellen bent over her and smoothed the coppery brown hair i didn t know she said gently i didn t know that who was it dear when mrs octavia beaupree n e van dresser stepped from the train at nopal her manner lost for the moment some of that easy certitude which had always marked her movements the town was of recent estab lishment and seemed to have been hastily constructed of undressed lumber and flapping canvas the element that had congregated about the station though not offensively demonstrative was clearly composed of citizens accustomed to and prepared for rude alarms octavia stood on the platform against the telegraph office and attempted to choose by intuition from the swaggering straggling string of loungers the manager of the rancho de las sombras who had been instructed by mr bannister to meet her there that tall serious looking elderly man in the blue flannel shirt and white tie she thought must be he but no he passed by removing his gaze from the lady as hers rested on him according to the southern custom the manager she thought with some impatience at being kept waiting should have no difficulty in selecting her young women wearing the most recent thing in ash coloured travelling suits were not so plentiful in nopal thus keeping a speculative watch on all persons of possible managerial aspect octavia with a catching breath and a start of surprise suddenly became aware of teddy westlake hurrying along the platform in the direction of the train of teddy westlake or his sun browned ghost in cheviot boots and leather girdled hat theodore westlake jr amateur polo almost champion all round butterfly and cumberer of the soil but a broader surer more emphasized and determined teddy than the one she had known a year ago when last she saw him he perceived octavia at almost the same time deflected his course and steered for her in his old straightforward way something like awe came upon her as the strange ness of his metamorphosis was brought into closer range the rich red brown of his complexion brought out so vividly his straw coloured mustache and steel gray eyes he seemed more grown up and somehow farther away but when he spoke the old boyish teddy came back again they had been friends from childhood why tave he exclaimed unable to reduce his perplexity to coherence how what when where train said octavia necessity ten minutes ago home your complexion s gone teddy now how what when where i m working down here said teddy he cast side glances about the station as one does who tries to combine politeness with duty you didn t notice on the train he asked an old lady with gray curls and a poodle who occupied two seats with her bundles and quarrelled with the conductor did you i think not answered octavia reflecting and you haven t by any chance noticed a big gray mustached man in a blue shirt and six shooters with little flakes of merino wool sticking in his hair have you lots of em said teddy with symptoms of mental delirium under the strain do you happen to know any such individual no the description is imaginary is your interest in the old lady whom you describe a personal one never saw her in my life she s painted entirely from fancy she owns the little piece of property where i earn my bread and butter the rancho de las sombras i drove up to meet her according to arrangement with her lawyer octavia leaned against the wall of the telegraph office was this possible and didn t he know are you the manager of that ranch she asked weakly i am said teddy with pride i am mrs beaupree said octavia faintly but my hair never would curl and i was polite to the conductor for a moment that strange grown up look came back and removed teddy miles away from her i hope you ll excuse me he said rather awkwardly you see i ve been down here in the chaparral a year i hadn t heard give me your checks please and i ll have your traps loaded into the wagon jos will follow with them we travel ahead

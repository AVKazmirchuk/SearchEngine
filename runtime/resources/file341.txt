he weathered every storm on deck smoking a black pipe to keep which alight rain and sea water seemed but as oil and he shook his fist at the black clouds behind which his baleful star winked its unseen eye when the skies cleared one evening he reviled his malignant guardian with grim humour on watch aren t you you red headed vixen out making it hot for little francis kearny and his friends according to hoyle twinkle twinkle little devil you re a lady aren t you dogging a man with your bad luck just because he happened to be born while your boss was floorwalker get busy and sink the ship you one eyed banshee phoebe h m sounds as mild as a milkmaid you can t judge a woman by her name why couldn t i have had a man star i can t make the remarks to phoebe that i could to a man oh phoebe you be blasted for eight days gales and squalls and waterspouts beat us from our course five days only should have landed us in esperando our jonah swallowed the bad credit of it with appealing frankness but that scarcely lessened the hardships our cause was made to suffer at last one afternoon we steamed into the calm estuary of the little rio escondido three miles up this we crept feeling for the shallow channel between the low banks that were crowded to the edge with gigantic trees and riotous vegetation then our whistle gave a little toot and in five minutes we heard a shout and carlos my brave carlos quintana crashed through the tangled vines waving his cap madly for joy a hundred yards away was his camp where three hundred chosen patriots of esperando were awaiting our coming for a month carlos had been drilling them there in the tactics of war and filling them with the spirit of revolution and liberty my captain compadre mio shouted carlos while yet my boat was being lowered you should see them in the drill by companies in the column wheel in the march by fours they are superb also in the manual of arms but alas performed only with sticks of bamboo the guns capitan say that you have brought the guns a thousand winchesters carlos i called to him and two gatlings valgame dios he cried throwing his cap in the air we shall sweep the world at that moment kearny tumbled from the steamer s side into the river he could not swim so the crew threw him a rope and drew him back aboard i caught his eye and his look of pathetic but still bright and undaunted consciousness of his guilty luck i told myself that although he might be a man to shun he was also one to be admired i gave orders to the sailing master that the arms ammunition and provisions were to be landed at once that was easy in the steamer s boats except for the two gatling guns for their transportation ashore we carried a stout flatboat brought for the purpose in the steamer s hold in the meantime i walked with carlos to the camp and made the soldiers a little speech in spanish which they received with enthusiasm and then i had some wine and a cigarette in carlos s tent later we walked back to the river to see how the unloading was being conducted the small arms and provisions were already ashore and the petty officers and squads of men conveying them to camp one gatling had been safely landed the other was just being hoisted over the side of the vessel as we arrived i noticed kearny darting about on board seeming to have the ambition of ten men and doing the work of five i think his zeal bubbled over when he saw carlos and me a rope s end was swinging loose from some part of the tackle kearny leaped impetuously and caught it there was a crackle and a hiss and a smoke of scorching hemp and the gatling dropped straight as a plummet through the bottom of the flatboat and buried itself in twenty feet of water and five feet of river mud i turned my back on the scene i heard carlos s loud cries as if from some extreme grief too poignant for words i heard the complaining murmur of the crew and the maledictions of torres the sailing master i could not bear to look by night some degree of order had been restored in camp military rules were not drawn strictly and the men were grouped about the fires of their several messes playing games of chance singing their native songs or discussing with voluble animation the contingencies of our march upon the capital to my tent which had been pitched for me close to that of my chief lieutenant came kearny indomitable smiling bright eyed bearing no traces of the buffets of his evil star rather was his aspect that of a heroic martyr whose tribulations were so high sourced and glorious that he even took a splendour and a prestige from them well captain said he i guess you realize that bad luck kearny is still on deck it was a shame now about that gun she only needed to be slewed two inches to clear the rail and that s why i grabbed that rope s end who d have thought that a sailor even a sicilian lubber on a banana coaster would have fastened a line in a bow knot don t think i m trying to dodge the responsibility captain it s my luck there are men kearny said i gravely who pass through life blaming upon luck and chance the mistakes that result from their own faults and incompetency i do not say that you are such a man but if all your mishaps are traceable to that tiny star the

continued van sweller gracefully for annoying you with questions but some of your methods are a little new to me shall i don a full dress suit with an immaculate white tie or is there another tradition to be upset you will wear i replied evening dress such as a gentleman wears if it is full your tailor should be responsible for its bagginess and i will leave it to whatever erudition you are supposed to possess whether a white tie is rendered any whiter by being immaculate and i will leave it to the consciences of you and your man whether a tie that is not white and therefore not immaculate could possibly form any part of a gentleman s evening dress if not then the perfect tie is included and understood in the term dress and its expressed addition predicates either a redundancy of speech or the spectacle of a man wearing two ties at once with this mild but deserved rebuke i left van sweller in his dressing room and waited for him in his library about an hour later his valet came out and i heard him telephone for an electric cab then out came van sweller smiling but with that sly secretive design in his eye that was puzzling me i believe he said easily as he smoothed a glove that i will drop in at footnote see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers for dinner i sprang up angrily at his words this then was the paltry trick he had been scheming to play upon me i faced him with a look so grim that even his patrician poise was flustered you will never do so i exclaimed with my permission what kind of a return is this i continued hotly for the favors i have granted you i gave you a van to your name when i might have called you perkins or simpson i have humbled myself so far as to brag of your polo ponies your automobiles and the iron muscles that you acquired when you were stroke oar of your varsity eight or eleven whichever it is i created you for the hero of this story and i will not submit to having you queer it i have tried to make you a typical young new york gentleman of the highest social station and breeding you have no reason to complain of my treatment to you amy ffolliott the girl you are to win is a prize for any man to be thankful for and cannot be equalled for beauty provided the story is illustrated by the right artist i do not understand why you should try to spoil everything i had thought you were a gentleman what it is you are objecting to old man asked van sweller in a surprised tone to your dining at i answered see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers the pleasure would be yours no doubt but the responsibility would fall upon me you intend deliberately to make me out a tout for a restaurant where you dine tonight has not the slightest connection with the thread of our story you know very well that the plot requires that you be in front of the alhambra opera house at where you are to rescue miss ffolliott a second time as the fire engine crashes into her cab until that time your movements are immaterial to the reader why can t you dine out of sight somewhere as many a hero does instead of insisting upon an inapposite and vulgar exhibition of yourself my dear fellow said van sweller politely but with a stubborn tightening of his lips i m sorry it doesn t please you but there s no help for it even a character in a story has rights that an author cannot ignore the hero of a story of new york social life must dine at see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers at least once during its action must i echoed disdainfully why must who demands it the magazine editors answered van sweller giving me a glance of significant warning but why i persisted to please subscribers around kankakee ill said van sweller without hesitation how do you know these things i inquired with sudden suspicion you never came into existence until this morning you are only a character in fiction anyway i myself created you how is it possible for you to know anything pardon me for referring to it said van sweller with a sympathetic smile but i have been the hero of hundreds of stories of this kind i felt a slow flush creeping into my face i thought i stammered i was hoping that is oh well of course an absolutely original conception in fiction is impossible in these days metropolitan types continued van sweller kindly do not offer a hold for much originality i ve sauntered through every story in pretty much the same way now and then the women writers have made me cut some rather strange capers for a gentleman but the men generally pass me along from one to another without much change but never yet in any story have i failed to dine at see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers you will fail this time i said emphatically perhaps so admitted van sweller looking out of the window into the street below but if so it will be for the first time the authors all send me there i fancy that many of them would have liked to accompany me but for the little matter of the expense i say i will be touting for no restaurant i repeated loudly you are subject to my will and i declare that you shall not appear of record this evening until the time arrives for you to rescue miss ffolliott again if the reading public cannot

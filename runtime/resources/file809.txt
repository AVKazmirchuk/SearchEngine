car thomas mcquade scenting an opportunity darted from his place among the preacher s goats in thirty seconds he had caught the rolling tire swung it over his shoulder and was trotting smartly after the car on both sides of the avenue people were shouting whistling and waving canes at the red car pointing to the enterprising thomas coming up with the lost tire one dollar thomas had estimated was the smallest guerdon that so grand an automobilist could offer for the service he had rendered and save his pride two blocks away the car had stopped there was a little brown muffled chauffeur driving and an imposing gentleman wearing a magnificent sealskin coat and a silk hat on a rear seat thomas proffered the captured tire with his best ex coachman manner and a look in the brighter of his reddened eyes that was meant to be suggestive to the extent of a silver coin or two and receptive up to higher denominations but the look was not so construed the sealskinned gentleman received the tire placed it inside the car gazed intently at the ex coachman and muttered to himself inscrutable words strange strange said he once or twice even i myself have fancied that the chaldean chiroscope has availed could it be possible then he addressed less mysterious words to the waiting and hopeful thomas sir i thank you for your kind rescue of my tire and i would ask you if i may a question do you know the family of van smuythes living in washington square north oughtn t i to replied thomas i lived there wish i did yet the sealskinned gentleman opened a door of the car step in please he said you have been expected thomas mcquade obeyed with surprise but without hesitation a seat in a motor car seemed better than standing room in the bed line but after the lap robe had been tucked about him and the auto had sped on its course the peculiarity of the invitation lingered in his mind maybe the guy hasn t got any change was his diagnosis lots of these swell rounders don t lug about any ready money guess he ll dump me out when he gets to some joint where he can get cash on his mug anyhow it s a cinch that i ve got that open air bed convention beat to a finish submerged in his greatcoat the mysterious automobilist seemed himself to marvel at the surprises of life wonderful amazing strange he repeated to himself constantly when the car had well entered the crosstown seventies it swung eastward a half block and stopped before a row of high stooped brownstone front houses be kind enough to enter my house with me said the sealskinned gentleman when they had alighted he s going to dig up sure reflected thomas following him inside there was a dim light in the hall his host conducted him through a door to the left closing it after him and leaving them in absolute darkness suddenly a luminous globe strangely decorated shone faintly in the centre of an immense room that seemed to thomas more splendidly appointed than any he had ever seen on the stage or read of in fairy tales the walls were hidden by gorgeous red hangings embroidered with fantastic gold figures at the rear end of the room were draped porti eres of dull gold spangled with silver crescents and stars the furniture was of the costliest and rarest styles the ex coachman s feet sank into rugs as fleecy and deep as snowdrifts there were three or four oddly shaped stands or tables covered with black velvet drapery thomas mcquade took in the splendors of this palatial apartment with one eye with the other he looked for his imposing conductor to find that he had disappeared b gee muttered thomas this listens like a spook shop shouldn t wonder if it ain t one of these moravian nights adventures that you read about wonder what became of the furry guy suddenly a stuffed owl that stood on an ebony perch near the illuminated globe slowly raised his wings and emitted from his eyes a brilliant electric glow with a fright born imprecation thomas seized a bronze statuette of hebe from a cabinet near by and hurled it with all his might at the terrifying and impossible fowl the owl and his perch went over with a crash with the sound there was a click and the room was flooded with light from a dozen frosted globes along the walls and ceiling the gold porti eres parted and closed and the mysterious automobilist entered the room he was tall and wore evening dress of perfect cut and accurate taste a vandyke beard of glossy golden brown rather long and wavy hair smoothly parted and large magnetic orientally occult eyes gave him a most impressive and striking appearance if you can conceive a russian grand duke in a rajah s throneroom advancing to greet a visiting emperor you will gather something of the majesty of his manner but thomas mcquade was too near his d t s to be mindful of his p s and q s when he viewed this silken polished and somewhat terrifying host he thought vaguely of dentists say doc said he resentfully that s a hot bird you keep on tap i hope i didn t break anything but i ve nearly got the williwalloos and when he threw them candle power lamps of his on me i took a snap shot at him with that little brass flatiron girl that stood on the sideboard that is merely a mechanical toy said the gentleman with a wave of his hand may i ask you to be seated while i explain why i brought you to my house perhaps you would not understand nor be in sympathy with the psychological prompting that caused me to do so so i will come to the point at once by venturing to refer to your admission that you know the van smuythe family of washington square north any silver missing asked thomas tartly any joolry displaced of course i know em any of the old ladies sunshades disappeared well i know em and then what the grand duke rubbed his white hands together softly wonderful he murmured wonderful shall i come to believe in the chaldean chiroscope myself let me assure you he continued that there is nothing for you to fear instead i think i can promise you that very good fortune awaits you we will see do they want me back asked thomas with something of his old professional pride in his voice i ll promise to cut out the booze and do the right thing if they ll try me again but how did you get wise doc b gee it s the swellest employment agency i was ever in with its flashlight owls and so forth with an indulgent smile the gracious host begged to be excused for two minutes he went out to the sidewalk and gave an order to the chauffeur who still waited with the car returning to the mysterious apartment he sat by his guest and began to entertain him so well by his witty and genial converse that the poor bed liner almost forgot the cold streets from which he had been so recently and so singularly rescued a servant brought some tender cold fowl and tea biscuits and a glass of miraculous wine and thomas felt the glamour of arabia envelop him thus half an hour sped quickly and then the honk of the returned motor car at the door suddenly drew the grand duke to his feet with another soft petition for a brief absence two women well muffled against the cold were admitted at the front door and suavely conducted by the master of the house down the hall through another door to the left and into a smaller room which was screened and segregated from the larger front room by heavy double porti eres here the furnishings were even more elegant and exquisitely tasteful than in the other on a gold inlaid rosewood table were scattered sheets of white paper and a queer triangular instrument or toy apparently of gold standing on little wheels the taller woman threw back her black veil and loosened her cloak she was fifty with a wrinkled and sad face the other young and plump took a chair a little distance away and to the rear as a servant or an attendant might have done you sent for me professor cherubusco said the elder woman wearily i hope you have something more definite than usual to say i ve about lost the little faith i had in your art i would not have responded to your call this evening if my sister had not insisted upon it madam said the professor with his princeliest smile the true art cannot fail to find the true psychic and potential branch sometimes requires time we have not succeeded i admint with the cards the crystal the stars the magic formulae of zarazin nor the oracle of po but we have at last discovered the true psychic route the chaldean chiroscope has been successful in our search the professor s voice had a ring that seemed to proclaim his belief in his own words the elderly lady looked at him with a little more interest why there was no sense in those words that it wrote with my hands on it she said what do you mean the words were these said professor cherubusco rising to his full magnificent height by the fifth wheel of the chariot he shall come i haven t seen many chariots said the lady but i never saw one with five wheels progress said the professor progress in science and mechanics has accomplished it though to be exact we may speak of it only as an extra tire progress in occult art has advanced in proportion madam i repeat that the chaldean chiroscope has succeeded i can not only answer the question that you have propounded but i can produce before your eyes the proof thereof and now the lady was disturbed both in her disbelief and in her poise o professor she cried anxiously when where has he been found do not keep me in suspense i beg you will excuse me for a very few minutes said professor cherubusco and i think i can demonstrate to you the efficacy of the true art thomas was contentedly munching the last crumbs of the bread and fowl when the enchanter appeared suddenly at his side are you willing to return to your old home if you are assured of a welcome and restoration to favor he asked with his courteous royal smile do i look bughouse answered thomas enough of the footback life for me but will they have me again the old lady is as fixed in her ways as a nut on a new axle my dear young man said the other she has been searching for you everywhere great said thomas i m on the job that team of dropsical domedaries they call horses is a handicap for a first class coachman like myself but i ll take the job back sure doc they re good people to be with and now a change came o er the suave countenance of the caliph of bagdad he looked keenly and suspiciously at the ex coachman may i ask what your name is he said shortly you ve been looking for me said thomas and don t know my name you re a funny kind of sleuth you must be one of the central office gumshoers i m thomas mcquade of course and i ve been chauffeur of the van smuythe elephant team for a year they fired me a month ago for well doc you saw what i did to your old owl i went broke on booze and when i saw the tire drop off your whiz wagon i was standing in that squad of hoboes at the worth monument waiting for a free bed now what s the prize for the best answer to all this to his intense surprise thomas felt himself lifted by the collar and dragged without a word of explanation to the front door this was opened and he was kicked forcibly down the steps with one heavy disillusionizing humiliating impact of the stupendous arabian s shoe as soon as the ex coachman had recovered his feet and his wits he hastened as fast as he could eastward toward broadway crazy guy was his estimate of the mysterious automobilist just wanted to have some fun kiddin i guess he might have dug up a dollar anyhow now i ve got to hurry up and get back to that gang of bum bed hunters before they all get preached to sleep when thomas reached the end of his two mile walk he found the ranks of the homeless reduced to a squad of perhaps eight or ten he took the proper place of a newcomer at the left end of the rear rank in a file in front of him was the young man who had spoken to him of hospitals and something of a wife and child sorry to see you back again said the young man turning to speak to him i hoped you had struck something better than this me said thomas oh i just took a run around the block to keep warm i see the public ain t lending to the lord very fast to night in this kind of weather said the young man charity avails itself of the proverb and both begins and ends at home and the preacher and his vehement lieutenant struck up a last hymn of petition to providence and man those of the bed liners whose windpipes still registered above degrees hopelessly and tunelessly joined in in the middle of the second verse thomas saw a sturdy girl with wind tossed drapery battling against the breeze and coming straight toward him from the opposite sidewalk annie he yelled and ran toward her you fool you fool she cried weeping and laughing and hanging upon his neck why did you do it the stuff explained thomas briefly you know but subsequently nit not a drop he led her to the curb how did you happen to see me i came to find you said annie holding tight to his sleeve oh you big fool professor cherubusco told us that we might find you here professor ch dont know the guy what saloon does he work in he s a clairvoyant thomas the greatest in the world he found you with the chaldean telescope he said he s a liar said thomas i never had it he never saw me have anybody s telescope and he said you came in a chariot with five wheels or something annie said thoms solicitously you re giving me the wheels now if i had a chariot i d have gone to bed in it long ago and without any singing and preaching for a nightcap either listen you big fool the missis says she ll take you back i begged her to but you must behave and you can go up to the house to night and your old room over the stable is ready great said thomas earnestly you are it annie but when did these stunts happen to night at professor cherubusco s he sent his automobile for the missis and she took me along i ve been there with her before what s the professor s line he s a clairvoyant and a witch the missis consults him he knows everything but he hasn t done the missis any good yet though she s paid him hundreds of dollars but he told us that the stars told him we could find you here what s the old lady want this cherry buster to do that s a family secret said annie and now you ve asked enough questions come on home you big fool they had moved but a little way up the street when thomas stopped got any dough with you annie he asked annie looked at him sharply oh i know what that look means said thomas you re wrong not another drop but there s a guy that was standing next to me in the bed line over there that s in bad shape he s the right kind and he s got wives or kids or something and he s on the sick list no booze if you could dig up half a dollar for him so he could get a decent bed i d like it annie s fingers began to wiggle in her purse sure i ve got money said she lots of it twelve dollars and then she added with woman s ineradicable suspicion of vicarious benevolence bring him here and let me see him first thomas went on his mission the wan bed liner came readily enough as the two drew near annie looked up from her purse and screamed mr walter oh mr walter is that you annie said the young man meekly oh mr walter and the missis hunting high and low for you does mother want to see me he asked with a flush coming out on his pale cheek she s been hunting for you high and low sure she wants to see you she wants you to come home she s tried police and morgues and lawyers and advertising and detectives and rewards and everything and then she took up clearvoyants you ll go right home won t you mr walter gladly if she wants me said the young man three years is a long time i suppose i ll have to walk up though unless the street cars are giving free rides i used to walk and beat that old plug team of bays we used to drive to the carriage have they got them yet they have said thomas feelingly and they ll have em ten years from now the life of the royal elephantibus truckhorseibus is one hundred and forty nine years i m the coachman just got my reappointment five minutes ago let s all ride up in a surface car that is er if annie will pay the fares on the broadway car annie handed each one of the prodigals a nickel to pay the conductor seems to me you are mighty reckless the way you throw large sums of money around said thomas sarcastically in that purse said annie decidedly is exactly i shall take every cent of it to morrow and give it to professor cherubusco the greatest man in the world well said thomas i guess he must be a pretty fly guy to pipe off things the way he does i m glad his spooks told him where you could find me if you ll give me his address some day i ll go up there myself and shake his hand presently thomas moved tentatively in his seat and thoughtfully felt an abrasion or two on his knees and his elbows say annie said he confidentially maybe it s one of the last dreams of booze but i ve a kind of a recollection of riding in authomobile with a swell guy that took me to a house full of eagles and arc lights he fed me on biscuits and hot air and then kicked me down the front steps if it was the d t s why am i so sore shut up you fool said annie if i could find that funny guy s house said thomas in conclusion i d go up there some day and punch his nose for him the poet and the peasant the other day a poet friend of mine who has lived in close communion with nature all his life wrote a poem and took it to an editor it was a living pastoral full of the genuine breath of the fields the song of birds and the pleasant chatter of trickling streams when the poet called again to see about it with hopes of a beefsteak dinner in his heart it was handed back to him with the comment too artificial several of us met over spaghetti and dutchess county chianti and swallowed indignation with slippery forkfuls and there we dug a pit for the editor with us was conant a well arrived writer of fiction a man who had trod on asphalt all his life and who had never looked upon bucolic scenes except with sensations of disgust from the windows of express trains conant wrote a poem and called it the doe and the brook it was a fine specimen of the kind of work you would expect from a poet who had strayed with amaryllis only as far as the florist s windows and whose sole ornithological discussion had been carried on with a waiter conant signed this poem and we sent it to the same editor but this has very little to do with the story just as the editor was reading the first line of the poem on the next morning a being stumbled off the west shore ferryboat and loped slowly up forty second street the invader was a young man with light blue eyes a hanging lip and hair the exact color of the little orphan s afterward discovered to be the earl s daughter in one of mr blaney s plays his trousers were corduroy his coat short sleeved with buttons in the middle of his back one bootleg was outside the corduroys you looked expectantly though in vain at his straw hat for ear holes its shape inaugurating the suspicion that it had been ravaged from a former equine possessor in his hand was a valise description of it is an impossible task a boston man would not have carried his lunch and law books to his office in it and above one ear in his hair was a wisp of hay the rustic s letter of credit his badge of innocence the last clinging touch of the garden of eden lingering to shame the gold brick men knowingly smilingly the city crowds passed him by they saw the raw stranger stand in the gutter and stretch his neck at the tall buildings at this they ceased to smile and even to look at him it had been done so often a few glanced at the antique valise to see what coney attraction or brand of chewing gum he might be thus dinning into his memory but for the most part he was ignored even the newsboys looked bored when he scampered like a circus clown out of the way of cabs and street cars at eighth avenue stood bunco harry with his dyed mustache and shiny good natured eyes harry was too good an artist not to be pained at the sight of an actor overdoing his part he edged up to the countryman who had stopped to open his mouth at a jewelry store window and shook his head too thick pal he said critically too thick by a couple of inches i don t know what your lay is but you ve got the properties too thick that hay now why they don t even allow that on proctor s circuit any more i don t understand you mister said the green one i m not lookin for any circus i ve just run down from ulster county to look at the town bein that the hayin s over with gosh but it s a whopper i thought poughkeepsie was some punkins but this here town is five times as big oh well said bunco harry raising his eyebrows i didn t mean to butt in you don t have to tell i thought you ought to tone down a little so i tried to put you wise wish you success at your graft whatever it is come and have a drink anyhow i wouldn t mind having a glass of lager beer acknowledged the other they went to a caf e frequented by men with smooth faces and shifty eyes and sat at their drinks i m glad i come across you mister said haylocks how d you like to play a game or two of seven up i ve got the keerds he fished them out of noah s valise a rare inimitable deck greasy with bacon suppers and grimy with the soil of cornfields bunco harry laughed loud and briefly not for me sport he said firmly i don t go against that make up of yours for a cent but i still say you ve overdone it the reubs haven t dressed like that since i doubt if you could work brooklyn for a key winding watch with that layout oh you needn t think i ain t got the money boasted haylocks he drew forth a tightly rolled mass of bills as large as a teacup and laid it on the table got that for my share of grandmother s farm he announced there s in that roll thought i d come to the city and look around for a likely business to go into bunco harry took up the roll of money and looked at it with almost respect in his smiling eyes i ve seen worse he said critically but you ll never do it in them clothes you want to get light tan shoes and a black suit and a straw hat with a colored band and talk a good deal about pittsburg and freight differentials and drink sherry for breakfast in order to work off phony stuff like that what s his line asked two or three shifty eyed men of bunco harry after haylocks had gathered up his impugned money and departed the queer i guess said harry or else he s one of jerome s men or some guy with a new graft he s too much hayseed maybe that his i wonder now oh no it couldn t have been real money haylocks wandered on thirst probably assailed him again for he dived into a dark groggery on a side street and bought beer at first sight of him their eyes brightened but when his insistent and exaggerated rusticity became apparent their expressions changed to wary suspicion haylocks swung his valise across the bar keep that a while for me mister he said chewing at the end of a virulent claybank cigar i ll be back after i knock around a spell and keep your eye on it for there s inside of it though maybe you wouldn t think so to look at me somewhere outside a phonograph struck up a band piece and haylocks was off for it his coat tail buttons flopping in the middle of his back divvy mike said the men hanging upon the bar winking openly at one another honest now said the bartender kicking the valise to one side you don t think i d fall to that do you anybody can see he ain t no jay one of mcadoo s come on squad i guess he s a shine if he made himself up there ain t no parts of the country now where they dress like that since they run rural free delivery to providence rhode island if he s got nine fifty in that valise it s a ninety eight cent waterbury that s stopped at ten minutes to ten when haylocks had exhausted the resources of mr edison to amuse he returned for his valise and then down broadway he gallivanted culling the sights with his eager blue eyes but still and evermore broadway rejected him with curt glances and sardonic smiles he was the oldest of the gags that the city must endure he was so flagrantly impossible so ultra rustic so exaggerated beyond the most freakish products of the barnyard the hayfield and the vaudeville stage that he excited only weariness and suspicion and the wisp of hay in his hair was so genuine so fresh and redolent of the meadows so clamorously rural that even a shellgame man would have put up his peas and folded his table at the sight of it haylocks seated himself upon a flight of stone steps and once more exhumed his roll of yellow backs from the valise the outer one a twenty he shucked off and beckoned to a newsboy son said he run somewhere and get this changed for me i m mighty nigh out of chicken feed i guess you ll get a nickel if you ll hurry up a hurt look appeared through the dirt on the newsy s face aw watchert ink g wan and get yer funny bill changed yerself dey ain t no farm clothes yer got on g wan wit yer stage money on a corner lounged a keen eyed steerer for a gambling house he was haylocks and his expression suddenly grew cold and virtuous mister said the rural one i ve heard of places in this here town where a fellow could have a good game of old sledge or peg a card at keno i got in this valise and i come down from old ulster to see the sights know where a fellow could get action on about or i m goin to have some sport and then maybe i ll buy out a business of some kind the steerer looked pained and investigated a white speck on his left forefinger nail cheese it old man he murmured reproachfully the central office must be bughouse to send you out looking like such a gillie you couldn t get within two blocks of a sidewalk crap game in them tony pastor props the recent mr scotty from death valley has got you beat a crosstown block in the way of elizabethan scenery and mechanical accessories let it be skiddoo for yours nay i know of no gilded halls where one may bet a patrol wagon on the ace rebuffed once again by the great city that is so swift to detect artificialities haylocks sat upon the curb and presented his thoughts to hold a conference it s my clothes said he durned if it ain t they think i m a hayseed and won t have nothin to do with me nobody never made fun of this hat in ulster county i guess if you want folks to notice you in new york you must dress up like they do so haylocks went shopping in the bazaars where men spake through their noses and rubbed their hands and ran the tape line ecstatically over the buldge in his inside pocket where reposed a red nubbin of corn with an even number of rows and messengers bearing parcels and boxes streamed to his hotel on broadway within the lights of long acre at o clock in the evening one descended to the sidewalk whom ulster county would have foresworn bright tan were his shoes his hat the latest block his light gray trousers were deeply creased a gay blue silk handkerchief flapped from the breast pocket of his elegant english walking coat his collar might have graced a laundry window his blond hair was trimmed close the wisp of hay was gone for an instant he stood resplendent with the leisurely air of a boulevardier concocting in his mind the route for his evening pleasures and then he turned down the gay bright street with the easy and graceful tread of a millionaire but in the instant that he had paused the wisest and keenest eyes in the city had enveloped him in their field of vision a stout man with gray eyes picked two of his friends with a lift of his eyebrows from the row of loungers in front of the hotel the juiciest jay i ve seen in six months said the man with gray eyes come along it was half past eleven when a man galloped into the west forty seventh street police station with the story of his wrongs nine hundred and fifty dollars he gasped all my share of grandmother s farm the desk seargeant wrung from him the name jabez bulltongue of locust valley farm ulster county and then bagan to take descriptions of the strong arm gentlemen when conant went to see the editor about the fate of his poem he was received over the head of the office boy into the inner office that is decorated with the statuettes by rodin and j g brown when i read the first line of the doe and the brook said the editor i knew it to be the work of one whose life has been heart to heart with nature the finished art of the line did not blind me to that fact to use a somewhat homely comparison it was as if a wild free child of the woods and fields were to don the garb of fashion and walk down broadway beneath the apparel the man would show thanks said conant i suppose the check will be round on thursday as usual the morals of this story have somehow gotten mixed you can take your choice of stay on the farm or don t write poetry the robe of peace mysteries follow one another so closely in a great city that the reading public and the friends of johnny bellchambers have ceased to marvel at his sudden and unexplained disappearance nearly a year ago this particular mystery has now been cleared up but the solution is so strange and incredible to the mind of the average man that only a select few who were in close touch with bellchambers will give it full credence johnny bellchambers as is well known belonged to the intrinsically inner circle of the elite without any of the ostentation of the fashionable ones who endeavor to attract notice by eccentric display of wealth and show he still was au fait in everything that gave deserved lustre to his high position in the ranks of society especially did he shine in the matter of dress in this he was the despair of imitators always correct exquisitely groomed and possessed of an unlimited wardrobe he was conceded to be the best dressed man in new york and therefore in america there was not a tailor in gotham who would not have deemed it a precious boon to have been granted the privilege of making bellchambers clothes without a cent of pay as he wore them they would have been a priceless advertisement trousers were his special passion here nothing but perfection would he notice he would have worn a patch as quickly as he would have overlooked a wrinkle he kept a man in his apartments always busy pressing his ample supply his friends said that three hours was the limit of time that he would wear these garments without exchanging bellchambers disappeared very suddenly for three days his absence brought no alarm to his friends and then they began to operate the usual methods of inquiry all of them failed he had left absolutely no trace behind then the search for a motive was instituted but none was found he had no enemies he had no debts there was no woman there were several thousand dollars in his bank to his credit he had never showed any tendency toward mental eccentricity in fact he was of a particularly calm and well balanced temperament every means of tracing the vanished man was made use of but without avail it was one of those cases more numerous in late years where men seem to have gone out like the flame of a candle leaving not even a trail of smoke as a witness in may tom eyres and lancelot gilliam two of bellchambers old friends went for a little run on the other side while pottering around in italy and switzerland they happened one day to hear of a monastery in the swiss alps that promised something outside of the ordinary tourist beguiling attractions the monastery was almost inaccessible to the average sightseer being on an extremely rugged and precipitous spur of the mountains the attractions it possessed but did not advertise were first an exclusive and divine cordial made by the monks that was said to far surpass benedictine and chartreuse next a huge brass bell so purely and accurately cast that it had not ceased sounding since it was first rung three hundred years ago finally it was asserted that no englishman had ever set foot within its walls eyres and gilliam decided that these three reports called for investigation it took them two days with the aid of two guides to reach the monastery of st gondrau it stood upon a frozen wind swept crag with the snow piled about it in treacherous drifting masses they were hospitably received by the brothers whose duty it was to entertain the infrequent guest they drank of the precious cordial finding it rarely potent and reviving they listened to the great ever echoing bell and learned that they were pioneer travelers in those gray stone walls over the englishman whose restless feet have trodden nearly every corner of the earth at three o clock on the afternoon they arrived the two young gothamites stood with good brother cristofer in the great cold hallway of the monastery to watch the monks march past on their way to the refectory they came slowly pacing by twos with their heads bowed treading noiselessly with sandaled feet upon the rough stone flags as the procession slowly filed past eyres suddenly gripped gilliam by the arm look he whispered eagerly at the one just opposite you now the one on this side with his hand at his waist if that isn t johnny bellchambers then i never saw him gilliam saw and recognized the lost glass of fashion what the deuce said he wonderingly is old bell doing here tommy it surely can t be he never heard of bell having a turn for the religious fact is i ve heard him say things when a four in hand didn t seem to tie up just right that would bring him up for court martial before any church it s bell without a doubt said eyres firmly or i m pretty badly in need of an oculist but think of johnny bellchambers the royal high chancellor of swell togs and the mahatma of pink teas up here in cold storage doing penance in a snuff colored bathrobe i can t get it straight in my mind let s ask the jolly old boy that s doing honors brother cristofer was appealed to for information by that time the monks had passed into the refectory he could not tell to which one they referred bellchambers ah the brothers of st gondrau abandoned their worldly names when they took the vows did the gentlemen wish to speak with one of the brothers if they would come to the refectory and indicate the one they wished to see the reverend abbot in authority would doubtless permit it eyres and gilliam went into the dining hall and pointed out to brother cristofer the man they had seen yes it was johnny bellchambers they saw his face plainly now as he sat among the dingy brothers never looking up eating broth from a coarse brown bowl permission to speak to one of the brothers was granted to the two travelers by the abbot and they waited in a reception room for him to come when he did come treading softly in his sandals both eyres and gilliam looked at him in perplexity and astonishment it was johnny bellchambers but he had a different look upon his smooth shaven face was an expression of ineffable peace of rapturous attainment of perfect and complete happiness his form was proudly erect his eyes shone with a serene and gracious light he was as neat and well groomed as in the old new york days but how differently was he clad now he seemed clothed in but a single garment a long robe of rough brown cloth gathered by a cord at the waist and falling in straight loose folds nearly to his feet he shook hands with his visitors with his old ease and grace of manner if there was any embarrassment in that meeting it was not manifested by johnny bellchambers the room had no seats they stood to converse glad to see you old man said eyres somewhat awkwardly wasn t expecting to find you up here not a bad idea though after all society s an awful sham must be a relief to shake the giddy whirl and retire to er contemplation and er prayer and hymns and those things oh cut that tommy said bellchambers cheerfully don t be afraid that i ll pass around the plate i go through these thing um bobs with the rest of these old boys because they are the rules i m brother ambrose here you know i m given just ten minutes to talk to you fellows that s rather a new design in waistcoats you have on isn t it gilliam are they wearing those things on broadway now it s the same old johnny said gilliam joyfully what the devil i mean why oh confound it what did you do it for old man peel the bathrobe pleaded eyres almost tearfully and go back with us the old crowd ll go wild to see you this isn t in your line bell i know half a dozen girls that wore the willow on the quiet when you shook us in that unaccountable way hand in your resignation or get a dispensation or whatever you have to do to get a release from this ice factory you ll get catarrh here johnny and my god you haven t any socks on bellchambers looked down at his sandaled feet and smiled you fellows don t understand he said soothingly it s nice of you to want me to go back but the old life will never know me again i have reached here the goal of all my ambitions i am entirely happy and contented here i shall remain for the remainder of my days you see this robe that i wear bellchambers caressingly touched the straight hanging garment at last i have found something that will not bag at the knees i have attained at that moment the deep boom of the great brass bell reverberated through the monastery it must have been a summons to immediate devotions for brother ambrose bowed his head turned and left the chamber without another word a slight wave of his hand as he passed through the stone doorway seemed to say a farewell to his old friends they left the monastery without seeing him again and this is the story that tommy eyres and lancelot gilliam brought back with them from their latest european tour the girl and the graft the other day i ran across my old friend ferguson pogue pogue is a conscientious grafter of the highest type his headquarters is the western hemisphere and his line of business is anything from speculating in town lots on the great staked plains to selling wooden toys in connecticut made by hydraulic pressure from nutmegs ground to a pulp now and then when pogue has made a good haul he comes to new york for a rest he says the jug of wine and loaf of bread and thou in the wilderness business is about as much rest and pleasure to him as sliding down the bumps at coney would be to president taft give me says pogue a big city for my vacation especially new york i m not much fond of new yorkers and manhattan is about the only place on the globe where i don t find any while in the metropolis pogue can always be found at one of two places one is a little second hand bookshop on fourth avenue where he reads books about his hobbies mahometanism and taxidermy i found him at the other his hall bedroom in eighteenth street where he sat in his stocking feet trying to pluck the banks of the wabash out of a small zither four years he has practised this tune without arriving near enough to cast the longest trout line to the water s edge on the dresser lay a blued steel colt s forty five and a tight roll of tens and twenties large enough around to belong to the spring rattlesnake story class a chambermaid with a room cleaning air fluttered nearby in the hall unable to enter or to flee scandalized by the stocking feet aghast at the colt s yet powerless with her metropolitan instincts to remove herself beyond the magic influence of the yellow hued roll i sat on his trunk while ferguson pogue talked no one could be franker or more candid in his conversation beside his expression the cry of henry james for lacteal nourishment at the age of one month would have seemed like a chaldean cryptogram he told me stories of his profession with pride for he considered it an art and i was curious enough to ask him whether he had known any women who followed it ladies said pogue with western chivalry well not to any great extent they don t amount to much in special lines of graft because they re all so busy in general lines what why they have to who s got the money in the world the men did you ever know a man to give a woman a dollar without any consideration a man will shell out his dust to another man free and easy and gratis but if he drops a penny in one of the machines run by the madam eve s daughters amalgamated association and the pineapple chewing gum don t fall out when he pulls the lever you can hear him kick to the superintendent four blocks away man is the hardest proposition a woman has to go up against he s the low grade one and she has to work overtime to make him pay two times out of five she s salted she can t put in crushers and costly machinery he d notice em and be onto the game they have to pan out what they get and it hurts their tender hands some of em are natural sluice troughs and can carry out to the ton the dry eyed ones have to depend on signed letters false hair sympathy the kangaroo walk cowhide whips ability to cook sentimental juries conversational powers silk underskirts ancestry rouge anonymous letters violet sachet powders witnesses revolvers pneumatic forms carbolic acid moonlight cold cream and the evening newspapers you are outrageous ferg i said surely there is none of this graft as you call it in a perfect and harmonious matrimonial union well said pogue nothing that would justify you every time in calling police headquarters and ordering out the reserves and a vaudeville manager on a dead run but it s this way suppose you re a fifth avenue millionaire soaring high on the right side of copper and cappers you come home at night and bring a diamond brooch to the lady who s staked your for a claim you hand it over she says oh george and looks to see if it s backed she comes up and kisses you you ve waited for it you get it all right it s graft but i m telling you about artemisia blye she was from kansas and she suggested corn in all of its phases her hair was as yellow as the silk her form was as tall and graceful as a stalk in the low grounds during a wet summer her eyes were as big and startling as bunions and green was her favorite color on my last trip into the cool recesses of your sequestered city i met a human named vaucross he was worth that is he had a million he told me he was in business on the street a sidewalk merchant says i sarcastic exactly says he senior partner of a paving concern i kind of took to him for this reason i met him on broadway one night when i was out of heart luck tobacco and place he was all silk hat diamonds and front he was all front if you had gone behind him you would have only looked yourself in the face i looked like a cross between count tolstoy and a june lobster i was out of luck i had but let me lay my eyes on that dealer again vaucross stopped and talked to me a few minutes and then he took me to a high toned restaurant to eat dinner there was music and then some beethoven and bordelaise sauce and cussing in french and frangipangi and some hauteur and cigarettes when i am flush i know them places i declare i must have looked as bad as a magazine artist sitting there without any money and my hair all rumpled like i was booked to read a chapter from elsie s school days at a brooklyn bohemian smoker but vaucross treated me like a bear hunter s guide he wasn t afraid of hurting the waiter s feelings mr pogue he explains to me i am using you go on says i i hope you don t wake up and then he tells me you know the kind of man he was he was a new yorker his whole ambition was to be noticed he wanted to be conspicuous he wanted people to point him out and bow to him and tell others who he was he said it had been the desire of his life always he didn t have but a million so he couldn t attract attention by spending money he said he tried to get into public notice one time by planting a little public square on the east side with garlic for free use of the poor but carnegie heard of it and covered it over at once with a library in the gaelic language three times he had jumped in the way of automibiles but the only result was five broken ribs and a notice in the papers that an unknown man five feet ten with four amalgam filled teeth supposed to be the last of the famous red leary gang had been run over ever try the reporters i asked him last month says mr vaucross my expenditure for lunches to reporters was get anything out of that i asks that reminds me says he add for perpsin yes i got indigestion how am i supposed to push along your scramble for prominence i inquires contrast something of that sort to night says vaucross it grieves me but i am forced to resort to eccentricity and here he drops his napkin in his soup and rises up and bows to a gent who is devastating a potato under a palm across the room the police commissioner says my climber gratified friend says i in a hurry have ambitions but don t kick a rung out of your ladder when you use me as a stepping stone to salute the police you spoil my appetite on the grounds that i may be degraded and incriminated be thoughtful at the quaker city squab en casserole the idea about artemisia blye comes to me suppose i can manage to get you in the papers says i a column or two every day in all of em and your picture in most of em for a week how much would it be worth to you ten thousand dollars says vaucross warm in a minute but no murder says he and i won t wear pink pants at a cotillon i wouldn t ask you to says i this is honorable stylish and uneffiminate tell the waiter to bring a demi tasse and some other beans and i will disclose to you the opus moderandi we closed the deal an hour later in the rococo rouge et noise room i telegraphed that night to miss artemisia in salina she took a couple of photographs and an autograph letter to an elder in the fourth presbyterian church in the morning and got some transportation and she stopped in topeka long enough to trade a flashlight interior and a valentine to the vice president of a trust company for a mileage book and a package of five dollar notes with scrawled on the band the fifth evening after she got my wire she was waiting all d ecollet ee and dressed up for me and vaucross to take her to dinner in one of these new york feminine apartment houses where a man can t get in unless he plays bezique and smokes depilatory powder cigarettes she s a stunner says vaucross when he saw her they ll give her a two column cut sure this was the scheme the three of us concocted it was business straight through vaucross was to rush miss blye with all the style and display and emotion he could for a month of course that amounted to nothing as far as his ambitions were concerned the sight of a man in a white tie and patent leather pumps pouring greenbacks through the large end of a cornucopia to purchase nutriment and heartsease for tall willowy blondes in new york is as common a sight as blue turtles in delirium tremens but he was to write her love letters the worst kind of love letters such as your wife publishes after you are dead every day at the end of the month he was to drop her and she would bring suit for for breach of promise miss artemisia was to get if she won the suit that was all and if she lost she was to get it anyhow there was a signed contract to that effect sometimes they had me out with em but not often i couldn t keep up to their style she used to pull out his notes and criticize them like bills of lading say you she d say what do you call this letter to a hardware merchant from his nephew on learning that his aunt has nettlerash you eastern duffers know as much about writing love letters as a kansas grasshopper does about tugboats my dear miss blye wouldn t that put pink icing and a little red sugar bird on your bridal cake how long do you expect to hold an audience in a court room with that kind of stuff you want to get down to business and call me tweedlums babe and honeysuckle and sing yourself mama s own big bad puggy wuggy boy if you want any limelight to concentrate upon your sparse gray hairs get sappy after that vaucross dipped his pen in the indelible tabasco his notes read like something or other in the original i could see a jury sitting up and women tearing one another s hats to hear em read and i could see piling up for mr vaucross as much notoriousness as archbishop crammer or the brooklyn bridge or cheese on salad ever enjoyed he seemed mighty pleased at the prospects they agreed on a night and i stood on fifth avenue outside a solemn restaurant and watched em a process server walked in and handed vaucross the papers at this table everybody looked at em and he looked as proud as cicero i went back to my room and lit a five cent cigar for i knew the was as good as ours about two hours later somebody knocked at my door there stood vaucross and miss artemisia and she was clinging yes sir clinging to his arm and they tells me they d been out and got married and they articulated some trivial cadences about love and such and they laid down a bundle on the table and said good night and left and that s why i say concluded ferguson pogue that a woman is too busy occupied with her natural vocation and instinct of graft such as is given her for self preservation and amusement to make any great success in special lines what was in the bundle they left i asked with my usual curiosity why said ferguson there was a scalper s railroad ticket as far as kansas city and two pairs of mr vaucross s old pants the call of the tame when the inauguration was accomplished the proceedings were made smooth by the presence of the rough riders it is well known that a herd of those competent and loyal ex warrriors paid a visit to the big city the newspaper reporters dug out of their trunks the old broad brimmed hats and leather belts that they wear to north beach fish fries and mixed with the visitors no damage was done beyond the employment of the wonderful plural tenderfeet in each of the scribe s stories the westerners mildly contemplated the skyscrapers as high as the third story yawned at broadway hunched down in the big chairs in hotel corridors and altogether looked as bored and dejected as a member of ye ancient and honorable artillery separated during a sham battle from his valet out of this sightseeing delegations of good king teddy s gentlemen of the royal bear hounds dropped one greenbrier nye of pin feather ariz the daily cyclone of sixth avenue s rush hour swept him away from the company of his pardners true the dust from a thousand rustling skirts filled his eyes the mighty roar of trains rushing across the sky deafened him the lightning flash of twice ten hundred beaming eyes confused his vision the storm was so sudden and tremendous that greenbrier s first impulse was to lie down and grab a root and then he remembered that the disturbance was human and not elemental and he backed out of it with a grin into a doorway the reporters had written that but for the widebrimmed hats the west was not visible upon these gauchos of the north heaven sharpen their eyes the suit of black diagonal wrinkled in impossible places the bright blue four in hand factory tied the low turned down collar pattern of the days of seymour and blair white glazed as the letters on the window of the open day and night except sunday restaurants the out curve at the knees from the saddle grip the peculiar spread of the half closed right thumb and fingers from the stiff hold upon the circling lasso the deeply absorbed weather tan that the hottest sun of cape may can never equal the seldom winking blue eyes that unconsciously divided the rushing crowds into fours as though they were being counted out of a corral the segregated loneliness and solemnity of expression as of an emperor or of one whose horizons have not intruded upon him nearer than a day s ride these brands of the west were set upon greenbrier nye oh yes he wore a broadbrimmed hat gentle

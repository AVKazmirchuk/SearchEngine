number of deep imprints shaped like ovals cut off square at one end now there is only one district in new york city where a man is bound to receive scars and wounds and indentations of that sort and that is along the sidewalks of twenty third street and a portion of sixth avenue south of there i knew from the imprints of trampling french heels on his feet and the marks of countless jabs in the face from umbrellas and parasols carried by women in the shopping district that he had been in conflict with the amazonian troops and as he was a man of intelligent appearance i knew he would not have braved such dangers unless he had been dragged thither by his own women folk therefore when he got on the car his anger at the treatment he had received was sufficient to make him keep his seat in spite of his traditions of southern chivalry that is all very well i said but why did you insist upon daughters and especially two daughters why couldn t a wife alone have taken him shopping there had to be daughters said jolnes calmly if he had only a wife and she near his own age he could have bluffed her into going alone if he had a young wife she would prefer to go alone so there you are i ll admit that i said but now why two daughters and how in the name of all the prophets did you guess that one was adopted when he told you he had three don t say guess said jolnes with a touch of pride in his air there is no such word in the lexicon of ratiocination in major ellison s buttonhole there was a carnation and a rosebud backed by a geranium leaf no woman ever combined a carnation and a rosebud into a boutonniere close your eyes whatsup and give the logic of your imagination a chance cannot you see the lovely adele fastening the carnation to the lapel so that papa may be gay upon the street and then the romping edith may dancing up with sisterly jealousy to add her rosebud to the adornment and then i cried beginning to feel enthusiasm when he declared that he had three daughters i could see said jolnes one in the background who added no flower and i knew that she must be adopted i broke in i give you every credit but how did you know he was leaving for the south to night in his breast pocket said the great detective something large and oval made a protuberance good liquor is scarce on trains and it is a long journey from new york to fairfax county again i must bow to you i said and tell me this so that my last shred of doubt will be cleared away why did you decide that he was from virginia it was very faint i admit answered shamrock jolnes but no trained observer could have failed to detect the odour of mint in the car the lady higher up new york city they said was deserted and that accounted doubtless for the sounds carrying so far in the tranquil summer air the breeze was south by southwest the hour was midnight the theme was a bit of feminine gossip by wireless mythology three hundred and sixty five feet above the heated asphalt the tiptoeing symbolic deity on manhattan pointed her vacillating arrow straight for the time in the direction of her exalted sister on liberty island the lights of the great garden were out the b enches in the square were filled with sleepers in postures so strange that beside them the writhing figures in dore s illustrations of the inferno would have straightened into tailor s dummies the statue of diana on the tower of the garden its constancy shown by its weathercock ways its innocence by the coating of gold that it has acquired its devotion to style by its single graceful flying scarf its candour and artlessness by its habit of ever drawing the long bow its metropolitanism by its posture of swift flight to catch a harlem train remained poised with its arrow pointed across the upper bay had that arrow sped truly and horizontally it would have passed fifty feet above the head of the heroic matron whose duty it is to offer a cast ironical welcome to the oppressed of other lands seaward this lady gazed and the furrows between steamship lines began to cut steerage rates the translators too have put an extra burden upon her liberty lighting the world as her creator christened her would have had a no more responsible duty except for the size of it than that of an electrician or a standard oil magnate but to enlighten the world as our learned civic guardians englished it requires abler qualities and so poor liberty instead of having a sinecure as a mere illuminator must be converted into a chautauqua schoolma am with the oceans for her field instead of the placid classic lake with a fireless torch and an empty head must she dispel the shadows of the world and teach it its a b c s ah there mrs liberty called a clear rollicking soprano voice through the still midnight air is that you miss diana excuse my not turning my head i m not as flighty and whirly whirly as some and tis so hoarse i am i can hardly talk on account of the peanut hulls left on the stairs in me throat by that last boatload of tourists from marietta ohio tis after being a fine evening miss if you don t mind my asking came the bell like tones of the golden statue i d like to know where you got that city hall brogue i didn

stand says o connor and listen and cast no perversions on the sword twas me father s in old munster and this map bowers is no diagram of a holiday procession if ye look again ye ll see that it s the continent known as south america comprising fourteen green blue red and yellow countries all crying out from time to time to be liberated from the yoke of the oppressor i know says i to o connor the idea is a literary one the ten cent magazine stole it from ridpath s history of the world from the sand stone period to the equator you ll find it in every one of em it s a continued story of a soldier of fortune generally named o keefe who gets to be dictator while the spanish american populace cries cospetto and other italian maledictions i misdoubt if it s ever been done you re not thinking of trying that are you barney i asks bowers says he you re a man of education and courage how can i deny it says i education runs in my family and i have acquired courage by a hard struggle with life the o connors says he are a warlike race there is me father s sword and here is the map a life of inaction is not for me the o connors were born to rule tis a ruler of men i must be barney i says to him why don t you get on the force and settle down to a quiet life of carnage and corruption instead of roaming off to foreign parts in what better way can you indulge your desire to subdue and maltreat the oppressed look again at the map says he at the country i have the point of me knife on tis that one i have selected to aid and overthrow with me father s sword i see says i it s the green one and that does credit to your patriotism and it s the smallest one and that does credit to your judgment do ye accuse me of cowardice says barney turning pink no man says i who attacks and confiscates a country single handed could be called a coward the worst you can be charged with is plagiarism or imitation if anthony hope and roosevelt let you get away with it nobody else will have any right to kick i m not joking says o connor and i ve got cash to work the scheme with i ve taken a liking to you do you want it or not i m not working i told him but how is it to be do i eat during the fomentation of the insurrection or am i only to be secretary of war after the country is conquered is it to be a pay envelope or only a portfolio i ll pay all expenses says o connor i want a man i can trust if we succeed you may pick out any appointment you want in the gift of the government all right then says i you can get me a bunch of draying contracts and then a quick action consignment to a seat on the supreme court bench so i won t be in line for the presidency the kind of cannon they chasten their presidents with in that country hurt too much you can consider me on the pay roll two weeks afterward o connor and me took a steamer for the small green doomed country we were three weeks on the trip o connor said he had his plans all figured out in advance but being the commanding general it consorted with his dignity to keep the details concealed from his army and cabinet commonly known as william t bowers three dollars a day was the price for which i joined the cause of

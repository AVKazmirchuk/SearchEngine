in some museum at rome some german anarchist i suppose they are always resting and talking but fergus was no talker he was brought up with the idea that to be beautiful was to make good his conversation was about as edifying as listening to a leak dropping in a tin dish pan at the head of the bed when you want to go to sleep but he and me got to be friends maybe because we was so opposite don t you think looking at the hallowe en mask that i call my face when i m shaving seemed to give fergus pleasure and i m sure that whenever i heard the feeble output of throat noises that he called conversation i felt contented to be a gargoyle with a silver tongue one time i found it necessary to go down to this coast town of oratama to straighten out a lot of political unrest and chop off a few heads in the customs and military departments fergus who owned the ice and sulphur match concessions of the republic says he ll keep me company so in a jangle of mule train bells we gallops into oratama and the town belonged to us as much as long island sound doesn t belong to japan when t r is at oyster bay i say us but i mean me everybody for four nations two oceans one bay and isthmus and five archipelagoes around had heard of judson tate gentleman adventurer they called me i had been written up in five columns of the yellow journals words with marginal decorations in a monthly magazine and a stickful on the twelfth page of the new york times if the beauty of fergus mcmahan gained any part of our reception in oratama i ll eat the price tag in my panama it was me that they hung out paper flowers and palm branches for i am not a jealous man i am stating facts the people were nebuchadnezzars they bit the grass before me there was no dust in the town for them to bite they bowed down to judson tate they knew that i was the power behind sancho benavides a word from me was more to them than a whole deckle edged library from east aurora in sectional bookcases was from anybody else and yet there are people who spend hours fixing their faces rubbing in cold cream and massaging the muscles always toward the eyes and taking in the slack with tincture of benzoin and electrolyzing moles to what end looking handsome oh what a mistake it s the larynx that the beauty doctors ought to work on it s words more than warts talk more than talcum palaver more than powder blarney more than bloom that counts the phonograph instead of the photograph but i was going to tell you the local astors put me and fergus up at the centipede club a frame building built on posts sunk in the surf the tide s only nine inches the little big high low jack in the game of the town came around and kowtowed oh it wasn t to herr mees they had heard about judson tate one afternoon me and fergus mcmahan was sitting on the seaward gallery of the centipede drinking iced rum and talking judson says fergus there s an angel in oratama so long says i as it ain t gabriel why talk as if you had heard a trump blow it s the senorita anabela zamora says fergus she s she s she s as lovely as as hell bravo says i laughing heartily you have a true lover s eloquence to paint the beauties of your inamorata you remind me says i of faust s wooing of marguerite that is if he wooed her after he went down the trap door of the stage judson says fergus you know you are as beautiless as a rhinoceros you can t have any interest in women i m awfully gone in miss anabela and that s why i m telling you oh seguramente says i i know i have a front elevation like an aztec god that guards a buried treasure that never did exist in jefferson county yucatan but there are compensations for instance i am it in this country as far as the eye can reach and then a few perches and poles and again says i when i engage people in a set to of oral vocal and laryngeal utterances i do not usually confine my side of the argument to what may be likened to a cheap phonographic reproduction of the ravings of a jellyfish oh i know says fergus amiable that i m not handy at small talk or large either that s why i m telling you i want you to help me how can i do it i asked i have subsidized says fergus the services of senorita anabela s duenna whose name is francesca you have a reputation in this country judson says fergus of being a great man and a hero i have says i and i deserve it and i says fergus am the best looking man between the arctic circle and antarctic ice pack with limitations says i as to physiognomy and geography i freely concede you to be between the two of us says fergus we ought to land the senorita anabela zamora the lady as you know is of an old spanish family and further than looking at her driving in the family carruaje of afternoons around the plaza or catching a glimpse of her through a barred window of evenings she is as unapproachable as a star land her for which one of us says i for me of course says fergus you ve never seen her now i ve had francesca point me out to her as being you on several occasions when she sees me on the plaza she thinks she s looking at don judson tate the greatest hero statesman and romantic figure in the country with your reputation and my looks combined in one man how can she resist him she s heard all about your thrilling history of course and she s seen me can any woman want more asks fergus mcmahan can she do with less i ask how can we separate our mutual attractions and how shall we apportion the proceeds then fergus tells me his scheme the house of the alcalde don luis zamora he says has a patio of course a kind of inner courtyard opening from the street in an angle of it is his daughter s window as dark a place as you could find and what do you think he wants me to do why knowing my freedom charm and skilfulness of tongue he proposes that i go into the patio at midnight when the hobgoblin face of me cannot be seen and make love to her for him for the pretty man that she has seen on the plaza thinking him to be don judson tate why shouldn t i do it for him for my friend fergus mcmahan for him to ask me was a compliment an acknowledgment of his own shortcomings you little lily white fine haired highly polished piece of dumb sculpture says i i ll help you make your arrangements and get me in the dark outside her window and my stream of conversation opened up with the moonlight tremolo stop turned on and she s yours keep your face hid jud says fergus for heaven s sake keep your face hid i m a friend of yours in all kinds of sentiment but this is a business deal if i could talk i wouldn t ask you but seeing me and listening to you i don t see why she can t be landed by you says i by me says fergus well fergus and the duenna francesca attended to the details and one night they fetched me a long black cloak with a high collar and led me to the house at midnight i stood by the window in the patio until i heard a voice as soft and sweet as an angel s whisper on the other side of the bars i could see only a faint white clad shape inside and true to fergus i pulled the collar of my cloak high up for it was july in the wet seasons and the nights were chilly and smothering a laugh as i thought of the tongue tied fergus i began to talk well sir i talked an hour at the senorita anabela i say at because it was not with now and then she would say oh senor or now ain t you foolin or i know you don t mean that and such things as women will when they are being rightly courted both of us knew english and spanish so in two languages i tried to win the heart of the lady for my friend fergus but for the bars to the window i could have done it in one at the end of the hour she dismissed me and gave me a big red rose i handed it over to fergus when i got home for three weeks every third or fourth night i impersonated my friend in the patio at the window of senorita anabela at last she admitted that her heart was mine and spoke of having seen me every afternoon when she drove in the plaza it was fergus she had seen of course but it was my talk that won her suppose fergus had gone there and tried to make a hit in the dark with his beauty all invisible and not a word to say for himself on the last night she promised to be mine that is fergus s and she put her hand between the bars for me to kiss i bestowed the kiss and took the news to fergus you might have left that for me to do says he that ll be your job hereafter says i keep on doing that and don t try to talk maybe after she thinks she s in love she won t notice the difference between real conversation and the inarticulate sort of droning that you give forth now i had never seen senorita anabela so the next day fergus asks me to walk with him through the plaza and view the daily promenade and exhibition of oratama society a sight that had no interest for me but i went and children and dogs took to the banana groves and mangrove swamps as soon as they had a look at my face here she comes said fergus twirling his moustache the one in white in the open carriage with the black horse i looked and felt the ground rock under my feet for senorita anabela zamora was the most beautiful woman in the world and the only one from that moment on so far as judson tate was concerned i saw at a glance that i must be hers and she mine forever i thought of my face and nearly fainted and then i thought of my other talents and stood upright again and i had been wooing her for three weeks for another man as senorita anabela s carriage rolled slowly past she gave fergus a long soft glance from the corners of her night black eyes a glance that would have sent judson tate up into heaven in a rubber tired chariot but she never looked at me and that handsome man only ruffles his curls and smirks and prances like a lady killer at my side what do you think of her judson asks fergus with an air this much says i she is to me mrs judson tate i am no man to play tricks on a friend so take your warning i thought fergus would die laughing well well well said he you old doughface struck too are you that s great but you re too late francesca tells me that anabela talks of nothing but me day and night of course i m awfully obliged to you for making that chin music to her of evenings but do you know i ve an idea that i could have done it as well myself mrs judson tate says i don t forget the name you ve had the use of my tongue to go with your good looks my boy you can t lend me your looks but hereafter my tongue is my own keep your mind on the name that s to be on the visiting cards two inches by three and a half mrs judson tate that s all all right says fergus laughing again i ve talked with her father the alcalde and he s willing he s to give a baile to morrow evening in his new warehouse if you were a dancing man jud i d expect you around to meet the future mrs mcmahan but on the next evening when the music was playing loudest at the alcade zamora s baile into the room steps judson tate in a new white linen clothes as if he were the biggest man in the whole nation which he was some of the musicians jumped off the key when they saw my face and one or two of the timidest senoritas let out a screech or two but up prances the alcalde and almost wipes the dust off my shoes with his forehead no mere good looks could have won me that sensational entrance i hear much senor zamora says i of the charm of your daughter it would give me great pleasure to be presented to her there were about six dozen willow rocking chairs with pink tidies tied on to them arranged against the walls in one of them sat senorita anabela in white swiss and red slippers with pearls and fireflies in her hair fergus was at the other end of the room trying to break away from two maroons and a claybank girl the alcalde leads me up to anabela and presents me when she took the first look at my face she dropped her fan and nearly turned her chair over from the shock but i m used to that i sat down by her and began to talk when she heard me speak she jumped and her eyes got as big as alligator pears she couldn t strike a balance between the tones of my voice and face i carried but i kept on talking in the key of c which is the ladies key and presently she sat still in her chair and a dreamy look came into her eyes she was coming my way she knew of judson tate and what a big man he was and the big things he had done and that was in my favour but of course it was some shock to her to find out that i was not the pretty man that had been pointed out to her as the great judson and then i took the spanish language which is better than english for certain purposes and played on it like a harp of a thousand strings i ranged from the second g below the staff up to f sharp above it i set my voice to poetry art romance flowers and moonlight i repeated some of the verses that i had murmured to her in the dark at her window and i knew from a sudden soft sparkle in her eye that she recognized in my voice the tones of her midnight mysterious wooer anyhow i had fergus mcmahan going oh the vocal is the true art no doubt about that handsome is as handsome palavers that s the renovated proverb i took senorita anabela for a walk in the lemon grove while fergus disfiguring himself with an ugly frown was waltzing with the claybank girl before we returned i had permission to come to her window in the patio the next evening at midnight and talk some more oh it was easy enough in two weeks anabela was engaged to me and fergus was out he took it calm for a handsome man and told me he wasn t going to give in talk may be all right in its place judson he says to me although i ve never thought it worth cultivating but says he to expect mere words to back up successfully a face like yours in a lady s good graces is like expecting a man to make a square meal on the ringing of a dinner bell but i haven t begun on the story i was going to tell you yet one day i took a long ride in the hot sunshine and then took a bath in the cold waters of a lagoon on the edge of the town before i d cooled off that evening after dark i called at the alcalde s to see anabela i was calling regular every evening then and we were to be married in a month she was looking like a bulbul a gazelle and a tea rose and her eyes were as soft and bright as two quarts of cream skimmed off from the milky way she looked at my rugged features without any expression of fear or repugnance indeed i fancied that i saw a look of deep admiration and affection such as she had cast at fergus on the plaza i sat down and opened my mouth to tell anabela what she loved to hear that she was a trust monopolizing all the loveliness of earth i opened my mouth and instead of the usual vibrating words of love and compliment there came forth a faint wheeze such as a baby with croup might emit not a word not a syllable not an intelligible sound i had caught cold in my laryngeal regions when i took my injudicious bath for two hours i sat trying to entertain anabela she talked a certain amount but it was perfunctory and diluted the nearest approach i made to speech was to formulate a sound like a clam trying to sing a life on the ocean wave at low tide it seemed that anabela s eyes did not rest upon me as often as usual i had nothing with which to charm her ears we looked at pictures and she played the guitar occasionally very badly when i left her parting manner seemed cool or at least thoughtful this happened for five evenings consecutively on the sixth day she ran away with fergus mcmahan it was known that they fled in a sailing yacht bound for belize i was only eight hours behind them in a small steam launch belonging to the revenue department before i sailed i rushed into the botica of old manuel iquito a half breed indian druggist i could not speak but i pointed to my throat and made a sound like escaping steam he began to yawn in an hour according to the customs of the country i would have been waited on i reached across the counter seized him by the throat and pointed again to my own he yawned once more and thrust into my hand a small bottle containing a black liquid take one small spoonful every two hours says he i threw him a dollar and skinned for the steamer i steamed into the harbour at belize thirteen seconds behind the yacht that anabela and fergus were on they started for the shore in a dory just as my skiff was lowered over the side i tried to order my sailormen to row faster but the sounds died in my larynx before they came to the light then i thought of old iquito s medicine and i got out his bottle and took a swallow of it the two boats landed at the same moment i walked straight up to anabela and fergus her eyes rested upon me for an instant then she turned them full of feeling and confidence upon fergus i knew i could not speak but i was desperate in speech lay my only hope i could not stand beside fergus and challenge comparison in the way of beauty purely involuntarily my larynx and epiglottis attempted to reproduce the sounds that my mind was calling upon my vocal organs to send forth to my intense surprise and delight the words rolled forth beautifully clear resonant exquisitely modulated full of power expression and long repressed emotion senorita anabela says i may i speak with you aside for a moment you don t want details about that do you thanks the old eloquence had come back all right i led her under a cocoanut palm and put my old verbal spell on her again judson says she when you are talking to me i can hear nothing else i can see nothing else there is nothing and nobody else in the world for me well that s about all of the story anabela went back to oratama in the steamer with me i never heard what became of fergus i never saw him any more anabela is now mrs judson tate has my story bored you much no said i i am always interested in psychological studies a human heart and especially a woman s is a wonderful thing to contemplate it is said judson tate and so are the trachea and bronchial tubes of man and the larynx too did you ever make a study of the windpipe never said i but i have taken much pleasure in your story may i ask after mrs tate and inquire of her present health and whereabouts oh sure said judson tate we are living in bergen avenue jersey city the climate down in oratama didn t suit mrs t i don t suppose you ever dissected the arytenoid cartilages of the epiglottis did you why no said i i am no surgeon pardon me said judson tate but every man should know enough of anatomy and therapeutics to safeguard his own health a sudden cold may set up capillary bronchitis or inflammation of the pulmonary vesicles which may result in a serious affection of the vocal organs perhaps so said i with some impatience but that is neither here nor there speaking of the strange manifestations of the affection of women i yes yes interrupted judson tate they have peculiar ways but as i was going to tell you when i went back to oratama i found out from manuel iquito what was in that mixture he gave me for my lost voice i told you how quick it cured me he made that stuff from the chuchula plant now look here judson tate drew an oblong white pasteboard box from his pocket for any cough he said or cold or hoarseness or bronchial affection whatsoever i have here the greatest remedy in the world you see the formula printed on the box each tablet contains licorice grains balsam tolu grain oil of anise minim oil of tar minim oleo resin of cubebs minim fluid extract of chuchula minim i am in new york went on judson tate for the purpose of organizing a company to market the greatest remedy for throat affections ever discovered at present i am introducing the lozenges in a small way i have here a box containing four dozen which i am selling for the small sum of fifty cents if you are suffering i got up and went away without a word i walked slowly up to the little park near my hotel leaving judson tate alone with his conscience my feelings were lacerated he had poured gently upon me a story that i might have used there was a little of the breath of life in it and some of the synthetic atmosphere that passes when cunningly tinkered in the marts and at the last it had proven to be a commercial pill deftly coated with the sugar of fiction the worst of it was that i could not offer it for sale advertising departments and counting rooms look down upon me and it would never do for the literary therefore i sat upon a bench with other disappointed ones until my eyelids drooped i went to my room and as my custom is read for an hour stories in my favourite magazines this was to get my mind back to art again and as i read each story i threw the magazines sadly and hopelessly one by one upon the floor each author without one exception to bring balm to my heart wrote liltingly and sprightly a story of some particular make of motor car that seemed to control the sparking plug of his genius and when the last one was hurled from me i took heart if readers can swallow so many proprietary automobiles i said to myself they ought not to strain at one of tate s compound magic chuchula bronchial lozenges and so if you see this story in print you will understand that business is business and that if art gets very far ahead of commerce she will have to get up and hustle i may as well add to make a clean job of it that you can t buy the chuchula plant in the drug stores art and the bronco out of the wilderness had come a painter genius whose coronations alone are democratic had woven a chaplet of chaparral for the brow of lonny briscoe art whose divine expression flows impartially from the fingertips of a cowboy or a dilettante emperor had chosen for a medium the boy artist of the san saba the outcome seven feet by twelve of besmeared canvas stood gilt framed in the lobby of the capitol the legislature was in session the capital city of that great western state was enjoying the season of activity and profit that the congregation of the solons bestowed the boarding houses were corralling the easy dollars of the gamesome law makers the greatest state in the west an empire in area and resources had arisen and repudiated the old libel or barbarism lawbreaking and bloodshed order reigned within her borders life and property were as safe there sir as anywhere among the corrupt cities of the effete east pillow shams churches strawberry feasts and habeas corpus flourished with impunity might the tenderfoot ventilate his stovepipe or his theories of culture the arts and sciences received nurture and subsidy and therefore it behooved the legislature of this great state to make appropriation for the purchase of lonny briscoe s immortal painting rarely has the san saba country contributed to the spread of the fine arts its sons have excelled in the solider graces in the throw of the lariat the manipulation of the esteemed the intrepidity of the one card draw and the nocturnal stimulation of towns from undue lethargy but hitherto it had not been famed as a stronghold of aesthetics lonny briscoe s brush had removed that disability here among the limestone rocks the succulent cactus and the drought parched grass of that arid valley had been born the boy artist why he came to woo art is beyond postulation beyond doubt some spore of the afflatus must have sprung up within him in spite of the desert soil of san saba the tricksy spirit of creation must have incited him to attempted expression and then have sat hilarious among the white hot sands of the valley watching its mischievous work for lonny s picture viewed as a thing of art was something to have driven away dull care from the bosoms of the critics the painting one might almost say panorama was designed to portray a typical western scene interest culminating in a central animal figure that of a stampeding steer life size wild eyed fiery breaking away in a mad rush from the herd that close ridden by a typical cowpuncher occupied a position somewhat in the right background of the picture the landscape presented fitting and faithful accessories chaparral mesquit and pear were distributed in just proportions a spanish dagger plant with its waxen blossoms in a creamy aggregation as large as a water bucket contributed floral beauty and variety the distance was undulating prairie bisected by stretches of the intermittent streams peculiar to the region lined with the rich green of live oak and water elm a richly mottled rattlesnake lay coiled beneath a pale green clump of prickly pear in the foreground a third of the canvas was ultramarine and lake white the typical western sky and the flying clouds rainless and feathery between two plastered pillars in the commodious hallway near the door of the chamber of representatives stood the painting citizens and lawmakers passed there by twos and groups and sometimes crowds to gaze upon it many perhaps a majority of them had lived the prairie life and recalled easily the familiar scene old cattlemen stood reminiscent and candidly pleased chatting with brothers of former camps and trails of the days it brought back to mind art critics were few in the town and there was heard none of that jargon of colour perspective and feeling such as the east loves to use as a curb and a rod to the pretensions of the artist twas a great picture most of them agreed admiring the gilt frame larger than any they had ever seen senator kinney was the picture s champion and sponsor it was he who so often stepped forward and asserted with the voice of a bronco buster that it would be a lasting blot sir upon the name of this great state if it should decline to recognize in a proper manner the genius that had so brilliantly transferred to imperishable canvas a scene so typical of the great sources of our state s wealth and prosperity land and er live stock senator kinney represented a section of the state in the extreme west miles from the san saba country but the true lover of art is not limited by metes and bounds nor was senator mullens representing the san saba country lukewarm in his belief that the state should purchase the painting of his constituent he was advised that the san saba country was unanimous in its admiration of the great painting by one of its own denizens hundreds of connoisseurs had straddled their broncos and ridden miles to view it before its removal to the capital senator mullens desired reelection and he knew the importance of the san saba vote he also knew that with the help of senator kinney who was a power in the legislature the thing could be put through now senator kinney had an irrigation bill that he wanted passed for the benefit of his own section and he knew senator mullens could render him valuable aid and information the san saba country already enjoying the benefits of similar legislation with these interests happily dovetailed wonder at the sudden interest in art at the state capital must necessarily be small few artists have uncovered their first picture to the world under happier auspices than did lonny briscoe senators kinney and mullens came to an understanding in the matter of irrigation and art while partaking of long drinks in the cafe of the empire hotel h m said senator kinney i don t know i m no art critic but it seems to me the thing won t work it looks like the worst kind of a chromo to me i don t want to cast any reflections upon the artistic talent of your constituent senator but i myself wouldn t give six bits for the picture without the frame how are you going to cram a thing like that down the throat of a legislature that kicks about a little item in the expense bill of six hundred and eighty one dollars for rubber erasers for only one term it s wasting time i d like to help you mullens but they d laugh us out of the senate chamber if we were to try it but you don t get the point said senator mullens in his deliberate tones tapping kinney s glass with his long forefinger i have my own doubts as to what the picture is intended to represent a bullfight or a japanese allegory but i want this legislature to make an appropriation to purchase of course the subject of the picture should have been in the state historical line but it s too late to have the paint scraped off and changed the state won t miss the money and the picture can be stowed away in a lumber room where it won t annoy any one now here s the point to work on leaving art to look after itself the chap that painted the picture is the grandson of lucien briscoe say it again said kinney leaning his head thoughtfully of the old original lucien briscoe of him the man who you know the man who carved the state out of the wilderness the man who settled the indians the man who cleaned out the horse thieves the man who refused the crown the state s favourite son do you see the point now wrap up the picture said kinney it s as good as sold why didn t you say that at first instead of philandering along about art i ll resign my seat in the senate and go back to chain carrying for the county surveyor the day i can t make this state buy a picture calcimined by a grandson of lucien briscoe did you ever hear of a special appropriation for the purchase of a home for the daughter of one eyed smothers well that went through like a motion to adjourn and old one eyed never killed half as many indians as briscoe did about what figure had you and the calciminer agreed upon to sandbag the treasury for i thought said mullens that maybe five hundred five hundred interrupted kinney as he hammered on his glass for a lead pencil and looked around for a waiter only five hundred for a red steer on the hoof delivered by a grandson of lucien briscoe where s your state pride man two thousand is what it ll be you ll introduce the bill and i ll get up on the floor of the senate and wave the scalp of every indian old lucien ever murdered let s see there was something else proud and foolish he did wasn t there oh yes he declined all emoluments and benefits he was entitled to refused his head right and veteran donation certificates could have been governor but wouldn t declined a pension now s the state s chance to pay up it ll have to take the picture but then it deserves some punishment for keeping the briscoe family waiting so long we ll bring this thing up about the middle of the month after the tax bill is settled now mullens you send over as soon as you can and get me the figures on the cost of those irrigation ditches and the statistics about the increased production per acre i m going to need you when that bill of mine comes up i reckon we ll be able to pull along pretty well together this session and maybe others to come eh senator thus did fortune elect to smile upon the boy artist of the san saba fate had already done her share when she arranged his atoms in the cosmogony of creation as the grandson of lucien briscoe the original briscoe had been a pioneer both as to territorial occupation and in certain acts prompted by a great and simple heart he had been one of the first settlers and crusaders against the wild forces of nature the savage and the shallow politician his name and memory were revered equally with any upon the list comprising houston boone crockett clark and green he had lived simply independently and unvexed by ambition even a less shrewd man than senator kinney could have prophesied that his state would hasten to honour and reward his grandson come out of the chaparral at even so late a day and so before the great picture by the door of the chamber of representatives at frequent times for many days could be found the breezy robust form of senator kinney and be heard his clarion voice reciting the past deeds of lucien briscoe in connection with the handiwork of his grandson senator mullens s work was more subdued in sight and sound but directed along identical lines then as the day for the introduction of the bill for appropriation draws nigh up from the san saba country rides lonny briscoe and a loyal lobby of cowpunchers bronco back to boost the cause of art and glorify the name of friendship for lonny is one of them a knight of stirrup and chaparreras as handy with the lariat and as he is with brush and palette on a march afternoon the lobby dashed with a whoop into town the cowpunchers had adjusted their garb suitably from that prescribed for the range to the more conventional requirements of town they had conceded their leather chaparreras and transferred their six shooters and belts from their persons to the horns of their saddles among them rode lonny a youth of twenty three brown solemn faced ingenuous bowlegged reticent bestriding hot tamales the most sagacious cow pony west of the mississippi senator mullens had informed him of the bright prospects of the situation had even mentioned so great was his confidence in the capable kinney the price that the state would in all likelihood pay it seemed to lonny that fame and fortune were in his hands certainly a spark of the divine fire was in the little brown centaur s breast for he was counting the two thousand dollars as but a means to future development of his talent some day he would paint a picture even greater than this one say twelve feet by twenty full of scope and atmosphere and action during the three days that yet intervened before the coming of the date fixed for the introduction of the bill the centaur lobby did valiant service coatless spurred weather tanned full of enthusiasm expressed in bizarre terms they loafed in front of the painting with tireless zeal reasoning not unshrewdly they estimated that their comments upon its fidelity to nature would be received as expert evidence loudly they praised the skill of the painter whenever there were ears near to which such evidence might be profitably addressed lem perry the leader of the claque had a somewhat set speech being uninventive in the construction of new phrases look at that two year old now he would say waving a cinnamon brown hand toward the salient point of the picture why dang my hide the critter s alive i can jest hear him lumpety lump a cuttin away from the herd pretendin he s skeered he s a mean scamp that there steer look at his eyes a wailin and his tail a wavin he s true and nat ral to life he s jest hankerin fur a cow pony to round him up and send him scootin back to the bunch dang my hide jest look at that tail of his n a wavin never knowed a steer to wave his tail any other way dang my hide ef i did jud shelby while admitting the excellence of the steer resolutely confined himself to open admiration of the landscape to the end that the entire picture receive its meed of praise that piece of range he declared is a dead ringer for dead hoss valley same grass same

and hunt a place to camp skinny rogers wedded to comedy conceived a complimentary little piece of acting that never failed to make an impression edging quite near to the picture he would suddenly at favourable moments emit a piercing and awful yi yi leap high and away coming down with a great stamp of heels and whirring of rowels upon the stone flagged floor jeeming cristopher so ran his lines thought that rattler was a gin u ine one ding baste my skin if i didn t seemed to me i heard him rattle look at the blamed unconverted insect a layin under that pear little more and somebody would a been snake bit with these artful dodges contributed by lonney s faithful coterie with the sonorous kinney perpetually sounding the picture s merits and with the solvent prestige of the pioneer briscoe covering it like a precious varnish it seemed that the san saba country could not fail to add a reputation as an art centre to its well known superiority in steer roping contests and achievements with the precarious busted flush thus was created for the picture an atmosphere due rather to externals than to the artist s brush but through it the people seemed to gaze with more of admiration there was a magic in the name of briscoe that counted high against faulty technique and crude colouring the old indian fighter and wolf slayer would have smiled grimly in his happy hunting grounds had he known that his dilettante ghost was thus figuring as an art patron two generations after his uninspired existence came the day when the senate was expected to pass the bill of senator mullens appropriating two thousand dollars for the purchase of the picture the gallery of the senate chamber was early preempted by lonny and the san saba lobby in the front row of chairs they sat wild haired self conscious jingling creaking and rattling subdued by the majesty of the council hall the bill was introduced went to the second reading and then senator mullens spoke for it dryly tediously and at length senator kinney then arose and the welkin seized the bellrope preparatory to ringing oratory was at that time a living thing the world had not quite time to measure its questions by geometry and the multiplication table it was the day of the silver tongue the sweeping gesture the decorative apostrophe the moving peroration the senator spoke the san saba contingent sat breathing hard in the gallery its disordered hair hanging down to its eyes its sixteen ounce hats shifted restlessly from knee to knee below the distinguished senators either lounged at their desks with the abandon of proven statesmanship or maintained correct attitudes indicative of a first term senator kinney spoke for an hour history was his theme history mitigated by patriotism and sentiment he referred casually to the picture in the outer hall it was unnecessary he said to dilate upon its merits the senators had seen for themselves the painter of the picture was the grandson of lucien briscoe then came the word pictures of briscoe s life set forth in thrilling colours his rude and venturesome life his simple minded love for the commonwealth he helped to upbuild his contempt for rewards and praise his extreme and sturdy independence and the great services he had rendered the state the subject of the oration was lucien briscoe the painting stood in the background serving simply as a means now happily brought forward through which the state might bestow a tardy recompense upon the descendent of its favourite son frequent enthusiastic applause from the senators testified to the well reception of the sentiment the bill passed without an opening vote to morrow it would be taken up by the house already was it fixed to glide through that body on rubber tires blandford grayson and plummer all wheel horses and orators and provided with plentiful memoranda concerning the deeds of pioneer briscoe had agreed to furnish the motive power the san saba lobby and its protege stumbled awkwardly down the stairs and out into the capitol yard then they herded closely and gave one yell of triumph but one of them buck kneed simmers it was hit the key with the thoughtful remark she cut the mustard he said all right i reckon they re goin to buy lon s steer i ain t right much on the parlyment ry but i gather that s what the signs added up but she seems to me lonny the argyment ran principal to grandfather instead of paint it s reasonable calculatin that you want to be glad you got the briscoe brand on you my son that remarked clinched in lonny s mind an unpleasant vague suspicion to the same effect his reticence increased and he gathered grass from the ground chewing it pensively the picture as a picture had been humiliatingly absent from the senator s arguments the painter had been held up as a grandson pure and simple while this was gratifying on certain lines it made art look little and slab sided the boy artist was thinking the hotel lonny stopped at was near the capitol it was near to the one o clock dinner hour when the appropriation had been passed by the senate the hotel clerk told lonny that a famous artist from new york had arrived in town that day and was in the hotel he was on his way westward to new mexico to study the effect of sunlight upon the ancient walls of the zunis modern stones reflect light those ancient building materials absorb it the artist wanted this effect in a picture he was painting and was traveling two thousand miles to get it lonny sought this man out after dinner and told his story the artist was an unhealthy man kept alive by genius and indifference to life he went with lonny to the capitol and stood there before the picture the artist pulled his beard and looked unhappy should like to have your sentiments said lonny just as they run out of the pen it s the way they ll come said the painter man i took three different kinds of medicine before dinner by the tablespoonful the taste still lingers i am primed for telling the truth you want to know if the picture is or if it isn t right said lonny is it wool or cotton should i paint some more or cut it out and ride herd a plenty i heard a rumour during pie said the artist that the state is about to pay you two thousand dollars for this picture it s passed the senate said lonny and the house rounds it up to morrow that s lucky said the pale man do you carry a rabbit s foot no said lonny but it seems i had a grandfather he s considerable mixed up in the colour scheme it took me a year to paint that picture is she entirely awful or not some says now that the steer s tail ain t badly drawed they think it s proportioned nice tell me the artist glanced at lonny s wiry figure and nut brown skin something stirred him to a passing irritation for art s sake son he said fractiously don t spend any more money for paint it isn t a picture at all it s a gun you hold up the state with it if you like and get your two thousand but don t get in front of any more canvas live under it buy a couple of hundred ponies with the money i m told they re that cheap and ride ride ride fill your lungs and eat and sleep and be happy no more pictures you look healthy that s genius cultivate it he looked at his watch twenty minutes to three four capsules and one tablet at three that s all you wanted to know isn t it at three o clock the cowpunchers rode up for lonny bringing hot tamales saddled traditions must be observed to celebrate the passage of the bill by the senate the gang must ride wildly through the town creating uproar and excitement liquor must be partaken of the suburbs shot up and the glory of the san saba country vociferously proclaimed a part of the programme had been carried out in the saloons on the way up lonny mounted hot tamales the accomplished little beast prancing with fire and intelligence he was glad to feel lonny s bowlegged grip against his ribs again lonny was his friend and he was willing to do things for him come on boys said lonny urging hot tomales into a gallop with his knees with a whoop the inspired lobby tore after him through the dust lonny led his cohorts straight for the capitol with a wild yell the gang endorsed his now evident intention of riding into it hooray for san saba up the six broad limestone steps clattered the broncos of the cowpunchers into the resounding hallway they pattered scattering in dismay those passing on foot lonny in the lead shoved hot tamales direct for the great picture at that hour a downpouring soft light from the second story windows bathed the big canvas against the darker background of the hall the painting stood out with valuable effect in spite of the defects of the art you could almost fancy that you gazed out upon a landscape you might well flinch a step from the convincing figure of the life size steer stampeding across the grass perhaps it seemed thus to hot tamales the scene was in his line perhaps he only obeyed the will of his rider his ears pricked up he snorted lonny leaned forward in the saddle and elevated his elbows wing like thus signals the cowpuncher to his steed to launch himself full speed ahead did hot tamales fancy he saw a steer red and cavorting that should be headed off and driven back to the herd there was a fierce clatter of hoofs a rush a gathering of steely flank muscles a leap to the jerk of the bridle rein and hot tamales with lonny bending low in the saddle to dodge the top of the frame ripped through the great canvas like a shell from a mortar leaving the cloth hanging in ragged sheds about a monstrous hole quickly lonny pulled up his pony and rounded the pillars spectators came running too astounded to add speech to the commotion the sergeant at arms of the house came forth frowned looked ominous and then grinned many of the legislators crowded out to observe the tumult lonny s cowpunchers were stricken to silent horror by his mad deed senator kinney happened to be among the earliest to emerge before he could speak lonny leaned in his saddle as hot tamales pranced pointed his quirt at the senator and said calmly that was a fine speech you made to day mister but you might as well let up on that propriation business i ain t askin the state to give me nothin i thought i had a picture to sell to it but it wasn t one you said a heap of things about grandfather briscoe that makes me kind of proud i m his grandson well the briscoes ain t takin presents from the state yet anybody can have the frame that wants it hit her up boys away scuttled the san saba delegation out of the hall down the steps along the dusty street halfway to the san saba country they camped that night at bedtime lonny stole away from the campfire and sought hot tamales placidly eating grass at the end of his stake rope lonny hung upon his neck and his art aspirations went forth forever in one long regretful sigh but as he thus made renunciation his breath formed a word or two you was the only one tamales what seen anything in it it did look like a steer didn t it old hoss phoebe you are a man of many novel adventures and varied enterprises i said to captain patricio malone do you believe that the possible element of good luck or bad luck if there is such a thing as luck has influenced your career or persisted for or against you to such an extent that you were forced to attribute results to the operation of the aforesaid good luck or bad luck this question of almost the dull insolence of legal phraseology was put while we sat in rousselin s little red tiled cafe near congo square in new orleans brown faced white hatted finger ringed captains of adventure came often to rousselin s for the cognac they came from sea and land and were chary of relating the things they had seen not because they were more wonderful than the fantasies of the ananiases of print but because they were so different and i was a perpetual wedding guest always striving to cast my buttonhole over the finger of one of these mariners of fortune this captain malone was a hiberno iberian creole who had gone to and fro in the earth and walked up and down in it he looked like any other well dressed man of thirty five whom you might meet except that he was hopelessly weather tanned and wore on his chain an ancient ivory and gold peruvian charm against evil which has nothing at all to do with this story my answer to your question said the captain smiling will be to tell you the story of bad luck kearny that is if you don t mind hearing it my reply was to pound on the table for rousselin strolling along tchoupitoulas street one night began captain malone i noticed without especially taxing my interest a small man walking rapidly toward me he stepped upon a wooden cellar door crashed through it and disappeared i rescued him from a heap of soft coal below he dusted himself briskly swearing fluently in a mechanical tone as an underpaid actor recites the gypsy s curse gratitude and the dust in his throat seemed to call for fluids to clear them away his desire for liquidation was expressed so heartily that i went with him to a cafe down the street where we had some vile vermouth and bitters looking across that little table i had my first clear sight of francis kearny he was about five feet seven but as tough as a cypress knee his hair was darkest red his mouth such a mere slit that you wondered how the flood of his words came rushing from it his eyes were the brightest and lightest blue and the hopefulest that i ever saw he gave the double impression that he was at bay and that you had better not crowd him further just in from a gold hunting expedition on the coast of costa rica he explained second mate of a banana steamer told me the natives were panning out enough from the beach sands to buy all the rum red calico and parlour melodeons in the world the day i got there a syndicate named incorporated jones gets a government concession to all minerals from a given point for a next choice i take coast fever and count green and blue lizards for six weeks in a grass hut i had to be notified when i was well for the reptiles were actually there then i shipped back as third cook on a norwegian tramp that blew up her boiler two miles below quarantine i was due to bust through that cellar door here to night so i hurried the rest of the way up the river roustabouting on a lower coast packet that made up a landing for every fisherman that wanted a plug of tobacco and now i m here for what comes next and it ll be along it ll be along said this queer mr kearny it ll be along on the beams of my bright but not very particular star from the first the personality of kearny charmed me i saw in him the bold heart the restless nature and the valiant front against the buffets of fate that make his countrymen such valuable comrades in risk and adventure and just then i was wanting such men moored at a fruit company s pier i had a ton steamer ready to sail the next day with a cargo of sugar lumber and corrugated iron for a port in well let us call the country esperando it has not been long ago and the name of patricio malone is still spoken there when its unsettled politics are discussed beneath the sugar and iron were packed a thousand winchester rifles in aguas frias the capital don rafael valdevia minister of war esperando s greatest hearted and most able patriot awaited my coming no doubt you have heard with a smile of the insignificant wars and uprisings in those little tropic republics they make but a faint clamour against the din of great nations battles but down there under all the ridiculous uniforms and petty diplomacy and senseless countermarching and intrigue are to be found statesmen and patriots don rafael valdevia was one his great ambition was to raise esperando into peace and honest prosperity and the respect of the serious nations so he waited for my rifles in aguas frias but one would think i am trying to win a recruit in you no it was francis kearny i wanted and so i told him speaking long over our execrable vermouth breathing the stifling odour from garlic and tarpaulins which as you know is the distinctive flavour of cafes in the lower slant of our city i spoke of the tyrant president cruz and the burdens that his green and insolent cruelty laid upon the people and at that kearny s tears flowed and then i dried them with a picture of the fat rewards that would be ours when the oppressor should be overthrown and the wise and generous valdevia in his seat then kearny leaped to his feet and wrung my hand with the strength of a roustabout he was mine he said till the last minion of the hated despot was hurled from the highest peaks of the cordilleras into the sea i paid the score and we went out near the door kearny s elbow overturned an upright glass showcase smashing it into little bits i paid the storekeeper the price he asked come to my hotel for the night i said to kearny we sail to morrow at noon he agreed but on the sidewalk he fell to cursing again in the dull monotonous way that he had done when i pulled him out of the coal cellar captain said he before we go any further it s no more than fair to tell you that i m known from baffin s bay to terra del fuego as bad

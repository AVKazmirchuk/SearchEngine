patter of restless little feet had never consecrated the one rugged highway between the two rows of tents and rough buildings later they would come but now yellowhammer was but a mountain camp and nowhere in it were the roguish expectant eyes opening wide at dawn of the enchanting day the eager small hands to reach for santa s bewildering hoard the elated childish voicings of the season s joy such as the coming good things of the warm hearted cherokee deserved of women there were five in yellowhammer the assayer s wife the proprietress of the lucky strike hotel and a laundress whose washtub panned out an ounce of dust a day these were the permanent feminines the remaining two were the spangler sisters misses fanchon and erma of the transcontinental comedy company then playing in repertoire at the improvised empire theatre but of children there were none sometimes miss fanchon enacted with spirit and address the part of robustious childhood but between her delineation and the visions of adolescence that the fancy offered as eligible recipients of cherokee s holiday stores there seemed to be fixed a gulf christmas would come on thursday on tuesday morning trinidad instead of going to work sought the judge at the lucky strike hotel it ll be a disgrace to yellowhammer said trinidad if it throws cherokee down on his christmas tree blowout you might say that that man made this town for one i m goin to see what can be done to give santa claus a square deal my co operation said the judge would be gladly forthcoming i am indebted to cherokee for past favours but i do not see i have heretofore regarded the absence of children rather as a luxury but in this instance still i do not see look at me said trinidad and you ll see old ways and means with the fur on i m goin to hitch up a team and rustle a load of kids for cherokee s santa claus act if i have to rob an orphan asylum eureka cried the judge enthusiastically no you didn t said trinidad decidedly i found it myself i learned about that latin word at school i will accompany you declared the judge waving his cane perhaps such eloquence and gift of language as i possess will be of benefit in persuading our young friends to lend themselves to our project within an hour yellowhammer was acquainted with the scheme of trinidad and the judge and approved it citizens who knew of families with offspring within a forty mile radius of yellowhammer came forward and contributed their information trinidad made careful notes of all such and then hastened to secure a vehicle and team the first stop scheduled was at a double log house fifteen miles out from yellowhammer a man opened the door at trinidad s hail and then came down and leaned upon the rickety gate the doorway was filled with a close mass of youngsters some ragged all full of curiosity and health it s this way explained trinidad we re from yellowhammer and we come kidnappin in a gentle kind of a way one of our leading citizens is stung with the santa claus affliction and he s due in town to morrow with half the folderols that s painted red and made in germany the youngest kid we got in yellowhammer packs a forty five and a safety razor consequently we re mighty shy on anybody to say oh and ah when we light the candles on the christmas tree now partner if you ll loan us a few kids we guarantee to return em safe and sound on christmas day and they ll come back loaded down with a good time and swiss family robinsons and cornucopias and red drums and similar testimonials what do you say in other words said the judge we have discovered for the first time in our embryonic but progressive little city the inconveniences of the absence of adolescence the season of the year having approximately arrived during which it is a custom to bestow frivolous but often appreciated gifts upon the young and tender i understand said the parent packing his pipe with a forefinger i guess i needn t detain you gentlemen me and the old woman have got seven kids so to speak and runnin my mind over the bunch i don t appear to hit upon none that we could spare for you to take over to your doin s the old woman has got some popcorn candy and rag dolls hid in the clothes chest and we allow to give christmas a little whirl of our own in a insignificant sort of style no i couldn t with any degree of avidity seem to fall in with the idea of lettin none of em go thank you kindly gentlemen down the slope they drove and up another foothill to the ranch house of wiley wilson trinidad recited his appeal and the judge boomed out his ponderous antiphony mrs wiley gathered her two rosy cheeked youngsters close to her skirts and did not smile until she had seen wiley laugh and shake his head again a refusal trinidad and the judge vainly exhausted more than half their list before twilight set in among the hills they spent the night at a stage road hostelry and set out again early the next morning the wagon had not acquired a single passenger it s creepin upon my faculties remarked trinidad that borrowin kids at christmas is somethin like tryin to steal butter from a man that s got hot pancakes a comin it is undoubtedly an indisputable fact said the judge that the ah family ties seem to be more coherent and assertive at that period of the year on the day before christmas they drove thirty miles making four fruitless halts and appeals everywhere they found kids at a premium the sun was low when the wife of a section boss on a lonely railroad huddled her unavailable progeny behind her and said there s a woman that s just took charge of the railroad eatin house down at granite junction i hear she s got a little boy maybe she might let him go trinidad pulled up his mules at granite junction at five o clock in the afternoon the train had just departed with its load of fed and appeased passengers on the steps of the eating house they found a thin and glowering boy of ten smoking a cigarette the dining room had been left in chaos by the peripatetic appetites a youngish woman reclined exhausted in a chair her face wore sharp lines of worry she had once possessed a certain style of beauty that would never wholly leave her and would never wholly return trinidad set forth his mission i d count it a mercy if you d take bobby for a while she said wearily i m on the go from morning till night and i don t have time to tend to him he s learning bad habits from the men it ll be the only chance he ll have to get any christmas the men went outside and conferred with bobby trinidad pictured the glories of the christmas tree and presents in lively colours and moreover my young friend added the judge santa claus himself will personally distribute the offerings that will typify the gifts conveyed by the shepherds of bethlehem to aw come off said the boy squinting his small eyes i ain t no kid there ain t any santa claus it s your folks that buys toys and sneaks em in when you re asleep and they make marks in the soot in the chimney with the tongs to look like santa s sleigh tracks that might be so argued trinidad but christmas trees ain t no fairy tale this one s goin to look like the ten cent store in albuquerque all strung up in a redwood there s tops and drums and noah s arks and oh rats said bobby wearily i cut them out long ago i d like to have a rifle not a target one a real one to shoot wildcats with but i guess you won t have any of them on your old tree well i can t say for sure said trinidad diplomatically it might be you go along with us and see the hope thus held out though faint won the boy s hesitating consent to go with this solitary beneficiary for cherokee s holiday bounty the canvassers spun along the homeward road in yellowhammer the empty storeroom had been transformed into what might have passed as the bower of an arizona fairy the ladies had done their work well a tall christmas tree covered to the topmost branch with candles spangles and toys sufficient for more than a score of children stood in the centre of the floor near sunset anxious eyes had begun to scan the street for the returning team of the child providers at noon that day cherokee had dashed into town with his new sleigh piled high with bundles and boxes and bales of all sizes and shapes so intent was he upon the arrangements for his altruistic plans that the dearth of children did not receive his notice no one gave away the humiliating state of yellowhammer for the efforts of trinidad and the judge were expected to supply the deficiency when the sun went down cherokee with many wings and arch grins on his seasoned face went into retirement with the bundle containing the santa claus raiment and a pack containing special and undisclosed gifts when the kids are rounded up he instructed the volunteer arrangement committee light up the candles on the tree and set em to playin pussy wants a corner and king william when they get good and at it why old santa ll slide in the door i reckon there ll be plenty of gifts to go round the ladies were flitting about the tree giving it final touches that were never final the spangled sisters were there in costume as lady violet de vere and marie the maid in their new drama the miner s bride the theatre did not open until nine and they were welcome assistants of the christmas tree committee every minute heads would pop out the door to look and listen for the approach of trinidad s team and now this became an anxious function for night had fallen and it would soon be necessary to light the candles on the tree and cherokee was apt to make an irruption at any time in his kriss kringle garb at length the wagon of the child rustlers rattled down the street to the door the ladies with little screams of excitement flew to the lighting of the candles the men of yellowhammer passed in and out restlessly or stood about the room in embarrassed groups trinidad and the judge bearing the marks of protracted travel entered conducting between them a single impish boy who stared with sullen pessimistic eyes at the gaudy tree where are the other children asked the assayer s wife the acknowledged leader of all social functions ma am said trinidad with a sigh prospectin for kids at christmas time is like huntin in a limestone for silver this parental business is one that i haven t no chance to comprehend it seems that fathers and mothers are willin for their offsprings to be drownded stole fed on poison oak and et by catamounts days in the year but on christmas day they insists on enjoyin the exclusive mortification of their company this here young biped ma am is all that washes out of our two days manoeuvres oh the sweet little boy cooed miss erma trailing her de vere robes to centre of stage aw shut up said bobby with a scowl who s a kid you ain t you bet fresh brat breathed miss erma beneath her enamelled smile we done the best we could said trinidad it s tough on cherokee but it can t be helped then the door opened and cherokee entered in the conventional dress of saint nick a white rippling beard and flowing hair covered his face almost to his dark and shining eyes over his shoulder he carried a pack no one stirred as he came in even the spangler sisters ceased their coquettish poses and stared curiously at the tall figure bobby stood with his hands in his pockets gazing gloomily at the effeminate and childish tree cherokee put down his pack and looked wonderingly about the room perhaps he fancied that a bevy of eager children were being herded somewhere to be loosed upon his entrance he went up to bobby and extended his red mittened hand merry christmas little boy said cherokee anything on the tree you want they ll get it down for you won t you shake hands with santa claus there ain t any santa claus whined the boy you ve got old false billy goat s whiskers on your face i ain t no kid what do i want with dolls and tin horses the driver said you d have a rifle and you haven t i want to go home trinidad stepped into the breach he shook cherokee s hand in warm greeting i m sorry cherokee he explained there never was a kid in yellowhammer we tried to rustle a bunch of em for your swaree but this sardine was all we could catch he s a atheist and he don t believe in santa claus it s a shame for you to be out all this truck but me and the judge was sure we could round up a wagonful of candidates for your gimcracks that s all right said cherokee gravely the expense don t amount to nothin worth mentionin we can dump the stuff down a shaft or throw it away i don t know what i was thinkin about but it never occurred to my cogitations that there wasn t any kids in yellowhammer meanwhile the company had relaxed into a hollow but praiseworthy imitation of a pleasure gathering bobby had retreated to a distant chair and was coldly regarding the scene with ennui plastered thick upon him cherokee lingering with his original idea went over and sat beside him where do you live little boy he asked respectfully granite junction said bobby without emphasis the room was warm cherokee took off his cap and then removed his beard and wig say exclaimed bobby with a show of interest i know your mug all right did you ever see me before asked cherokee i don t know but i ve seen your picture lots of times where the boy hesitated on the bureau at home he answered let s have your name if you please buddy robert lumsden the picture belongs to my mother she puts it under her pillow of nights and once i saw her kiss it i wouldn t but women are that way cherokee rose and beckoned to trinidad keep this boy by you till i come back he said i m goin to shed these christmas duds and hitch up my sleigh i m goin to take this kid home well infidel said trinidad taking cherokee s vacant chair and so you are too superannuated and effete to yearn for such mockeries as candy and toys it seems i don t like you said bobby with acrimony you said there would be a rifle a fellow can t even smoke i wish i was at home cherokee drove his sleigh to the door and they lifted bobby in beside him the team of fine horses sprang away prancingly over the hard snow cherokee had on his overcoat of baby sealskin the laprobe that he drew about them was as warm as velvet bobby slipped a cigarette from his pocket and was trying to snap a match throw that cigarette away said cherokee in a quiet but new voice bobby hesitated and then dropped the cylinder overboard throw the box too commanded the new voice more reluctantly the boy obeyed say said bobby presently i like you i don t know why nobody never made me do anything i didn t want to do before tell me kid said cherokee not using his new voice are you sure your mother kissed that picture that looks like me dead sure i seen her do it didn t you remark somethin a while ago about wanting a rifle you bet i did will you get me one to morrow silver mounted cherokee took out his watch half past nine we ll hit the junction plumb on time with christmas day are you cold sit closer son a chaparral prince nine o clock at last and the drudging toil of the day was ended lena climbed to her room in the third half story of the quarrymen s hotel since daylight she had slaved doing the work of a full grown woman scrubbing the floors washing the heavy ironstone plates and cups making the beds and supplying the insatiate demands for wood and water in that turbulent and depressing hostelry the din of the day s quarrying was over the blasting and drilling the creaking of the great cranes the shouts of the foremen the backing and shifting of the flat cars hauling the heavy blocks of limestone down in the hotel office three or four of the labourers were growling and swearing over a belated game of checkers heavy odours of stewed meat hot grease and cheap coffee hung like a depressing fog about the house lena lit the stump of a candle and sat limply upon her wooden chair she was eleven years old thin and ill nourished her back and limbs were sore and aching but the ache in her heart made the biggest trouble the last straw had been added to the burden upon her small shoulders they had taken away grimm always at night however tired she might be she had turned to grimm for comfort and hope each time had grimm whispered to her that the prince or the fairy would come and deliver her out of the wicked enchantment every night she had taken fresh courage and strength from grimm to whatever tale she read she found an analogy in her own condition the woodcutter s lost child the unhappy goose girl the persecuted stepdaughter the little maiden imprisoned in the witch s hut all these were but transparent disguises for lena the overworked kitchenmaid in the quarrymen s hotel and always when the extremity was direst came the good fairy or the gallant prince to the rescue so here in the ogre s castle enslaved by a wicked spell lena had leaned upon grimm and waited longing for the powers of goodness to prevail but on the day before mrs maloney had found the book in her room and had carried it away declaring sharply that it would not do for servants to read at night they lost sleep and did not work briskly the next day can one only eleven years old living away from one s mamma and never having any time to play live entirely deprived of grimm just try it once and you will see what a difficult thing it is lena s home was in texas away up among the little mountains on the pedernales river in a little town called fredericksburg they are all german people who live in fredericksburg of evenings they sit at little tables along the sidewalk and drink beer and play pinochle and scat they are very thrifty people thriftiest among them was peter hildesmuller lena s father and that is why lena was sent to work in the hotel at the quarries thirty miles away she earned three dollars every week there and peter added her wages to his well guarded store peter had an ambition to become as rich as his neighbour hugo heffelbauer who smoked a meerschaum pipe three feet long and had wiener schnitzel and hassenpfeffer for dinner every day in the week and now lena was quite old enough to work and assist in the accumulation of riches but conjecture if you can what it means to be sentenced at eleven years of age from a home in the pleasant little rhine village to hard labour in the ogre s castle where you must fly to serve the ogres while they devour cattle and sheep growling fiercely as they stamp white limestone dust from their great shoes for you to sweep and scour with your weak aching fingers and then to have grimm taken away from you lena raised the lid of an old empty case that had once contained canned corn and got out a sheet of paper and a piece of pencil she was going to write a letter to her mamma tommy ryan was going to post it for her at ballinger s tommy was seventeen worked in the quarries went home to ballinger s every night and was now waiting in the shadows under lena s window for her to throw the letter out to him that was the only way she could send a letter to fredericksburg mrs maloney did not like for her to write letters the stump of the candle was burning low so lena hastily bit the wood from around the lead of her pencil and began this is the letter she wrote dearest mamma i want so much to see you and gretel and claus and heinrich and little adolf i am so tired i want to see you to day i was slapped by mrs maloney and had no supper i could not bring in enough wood for my hand hurt she took my book yesterday i mean grimm s fairy tales which uncle leo gave me it did not hurt any one for me to read the book i try to work as well as i can but there is so much to do i read only a little bit every night dear mamma i shall tell you what i am going to do unless you send for me to morrow to bring me home i shall go to a deep place i know in the river and drown it is wicked to drown i suppose but i wanted to see you and there is no one else i am very tired and tommy is waiting for the letter you will excuse me mamma if i do it your respectful and loving daughter lena tommy was still waiting faithfully when the letter was concluded and when lena dropped it out she saw him pick it up and start up the steep hillside without undressing she blew out the candle and curled herself upon the mattress on the floor at o clock old man ballinger came out of his house in his stocking feet and leaned over the gate smoking his pipe he looked down the big road white in the moonshine and rubbed one ankle with the toe of his other foot it was time for the fredericksburg mail to come pattering up the road old man ballinger had waited only a few minutes when he heard the lively hoofbeats of fritz s team of little black mules and very soon afterward his covered spring wagon stood in front of the gate fritz s big spectacles flashed in the moonlight and his tremendous voice shouted a greeting to the postmaster of ballinger s the mail carrier jumped out and took the bridles from the mules for he always fed them oats at ballinger s while the mules were eating from their feed bags old man ballinger brought out the mail sack and threw it into the wagon fritz bergmann was a man of three sentiments or to be more accurate four the pair of mules deserving to be reckoned individually those mules were the chief interest and joy of his existence next came the emperor of germany and lena hildesmuller tell me said fritz when he was ready to start contains the sack a letter to frau hildesmuller from the little lena at the quarries one came in the last mail to say that she is a little sick already her mamma is very anxious to hear again yes said old man ballinger thar s a letter for mrs helterskelter or some sich name tommy ryan brung it over when he come her little gal workin over thar you say in the hotel shouted fritz as he gathered up the lines eleven years old and not bigger as a frankfurter the close fist of a peter hildesmuller some day i shall with a big club pound that man s dummkopf all in and out the town perhaps in this letter lena will say that she is yet feeling better so her mamma will be glad auf wiedersehen herr ballinger your feets will take cold out in the night air so long fritzy said old man ballinger you got a nice cool night for your drive up the road went the little black mules at their steady trot while fritz thundered at them occasional words of endearment and cheer these fancies occupied the mind of the mail carrier until he reached the big post oak forest eight miles from ballinger s here his ruminations were scattered by the sudden flash and report of pistols and a whooping as if from a whole tribe of indians a band of galloping centaurs closed in around the mail wagon one of them leaned over the front wheel covered the driver with his revolver and ordered him to stop others caught at the bridles of donder and blitzen donnerwetter shouted fritz with all his tremendous voice wass ist release your hands from dose mules ve vas der united states mail hurry up dutch drawled a melancholy voice don t you know when you re in a stick up reverse your mules and climb out of the cart it is due to the breadth of hondo bill s demerit and the largeness of his achievements to state that the holding up of the fredericksburg mail was not perpetrated by way of an exploit as the lion while in the pursuit of prey commensurate to his prowess might set a frivolous foot upon a casual rabbit in his path so hondo bill and his gang had swooped sportively upon the pacific transport of meinherr fritz the real work of their sinister night ride was over fritz and his mail bag and his mules came as gentle relaxation grateful after the arduous duties of their profession twenty miles to the southeast stood a train with a killed engine hysterical passengers and a looted express and mail car that represented the serious occupation of hondo bill and his gang with a fairly rich prize of currency and silver the robbers were making a wide detour to the west through the less populous country intending to seek safety in mexico by means of some fordable spot on the rio grande the booty from the train had melted the desperate bushrangers to jovial and happy skylarkers trembling with outraged dignity and no little personal apprehension fritz climbed out to the road after replacing his suddenly removed spectacles the band had dismounted and were singing capering and whooping thus expressing their satisfied delight in the life of a jolly outlaw rattlesnake rogers who stood at the heads of the mules jerked a little too vigorously at the rein of the tender mouthed donder who reared and emitted a loud protesting snort of pain instantly fritz with a scream of anger flew at the bulky rogers and began to assiduously pummel that surprised freebooter with his fists villain shouted fritz dog bigstiff dot mule he has a soreness by his mouth i vill knock off your shoulders mit your head robbermans yi yi howled rattlesnake roaring with laughter and ducking his head somebody git this here sour krout off n me one of the band yanked fritz back by the coat tail and the woods rang with rattlesnake s vociferous comments the dog goned little wienerwurst he yelled amiably he s not so much of a skunk for a dutchman took up for his animile plum quick didn t he i like to see a man like his hoss even if it is a mule the dad blamed little limburger he went for me didn t he whoa now muley i ain t a goin to hurt your mouth agin any more perhaps the mail would not have been tampered with had not ben moody the lieutenant possessed certain wisdom that seemed to promise more spoils say cap he said addressing hondo bill there s likely to be good pickings in these mail sacks i ve done some hoss tradin with these dutchmen around fredericksburg and i know the style of the varmints there s big money goes through the mails to that town them dutch risk a thousand dollars sent wrapped in a piece of paper before they d pay the banks to handle the money hondo bill six feet two gentle of voice and impulsive in action was dragging the sacks from the rear of the wagon before moody had finished his speech a knife shone in his hand and they heard the ripping sound as it bit through the tough canvas the outlaws crowded around and began tearing open letters and packages enlivening their labours by swearing affably at the writers who seemed to have conspired to confute the prediction of ben moody not a dollar was found in the fredericksburg mail you ought to be ashamed of yourself said hondo bill to the mail carrier in solemn tones to be packing around such a lot of old trashy paper as this what d you mean by it anyhow where do you dutchers keep your money at the ballinger mail sack opened like a cocoon under hondo s knife it contained but a handful of mail fritz had been fuming with terror and excitement until this sack was reached he now remembered lena s letter he addressed the leader of the band asking that that particular missive be spared much obliged dutch he said to the disturbed carrier i guess that s the letter we want got spondulicks in it ain t it here she is make a light boys hondo found and tore open the letter to mrs hildesmuller the others stood about lighting twisted up letters one from another hondo gazed with mute disapproval at the single sheet of paper covered with the angular german script whatever is this you ve humbugged us with dutchy you call this here a valuable letter that s a mighty low down trick to play on your friends what come along to help you distribute your mail that s chiny writin said sandy grundy peering over hondo s shoulder you re off your kazip declared another of the gang an effective youth covered with silk handkerchiefs and nickel plating that s shorthand i see em do it once in court ach no no no dot is german said fritz it is no more as a little girl writing a letter to her mamma one poor little girl sick and vorking hard avay from home ach it is a shame good mr robberman you vill please let me have dot letter what the devil do you take us for old pretzels said hondo with sudden and surprising severity you ain t presumin to insinuate that we gents ain t possessed of sufficient politeness for to take an interest in the miss s health are you now you go on and you read that scratchin out loud and in plain united states language to this here company of educated society hondo twirled his six shooter by its trigger guard and stood towering above the little german who at once began to read the letter translating the simple words into english the gang of rovers stood in absolute silence listening intently how old is that kid asked hondo when the letter was done eleven said fritz and where is she at at dose rock quarries working ach mein gott little lena she speak of drowning i do not know if she vill do it but if she shall i schwear i vill dot peter hildesmuller shoot mit a gun you dutchers said hondo bill his voice swelling with fine contempt make me plenty tired hirin out your kids to work when they ought to be playin dolls in the sand you re a hell of a sect of people i reckon we ll fix your clock for a while just to show what we think of your old cheesy nation here boys hondo bill parleyed aside briefly with his band and then they seized fritz and conveyed him off the road to one side here they bound him fast to a tree with a couple of lariats his team they tied to another tree near by we ain t going to hurt you bad said hondo reassuringly twon t hurt you to be tied up for a while we will now pass you the time of day as it is up to us to depart ausgespielt nixcumrous dutchy don t get any more impatience fritz heard a great squeaking of saddles as the men mounted their horses then a loud yell and a great clatter of hoofs as they galloped pell mell back along the fredericksburg road for more than two hours fritz sat against his tree tightly but not painfully bound then from the reaction after his exciting adventure he sank into slumber how long he slept he knew not but he was at last awakened by a rough shake hands were untying his ropes he was lifted to his feet dazed confused in mind and weary of body rubbing his eyes he looked and saw that he was again in the midst of the same band of terrible bandits they shoved him up to the seat of his wagon and placed the lines in his hands hit it out for home dutch said hondo bill s voice commandingly you ve given us lots of trouble and we re pleased to see the back of your neck spiel zwei bier vamoose hondo reached out and gave blitzen a smart cut with his quirt the little mules sprang ahead glad to be moving again fritz urged them along himself dizzy and muddled over his fearful adventure according to schedule time he should have reached fredericksburg at daylight as it was he drove down the long street of the town at eleven o clock a m he had to pass peter hildesmuller s house on his way to the post office he stopped his team at the gate and called but frau hildesmuller was watching for him out rushed the whole family of hildesmullers frau hildesmuller fat and flushed inquired if he had a letter from lena and then fritz raised his voice and told the tale of his adventure he told the contents of that letter that the robber had made him read and then frau hildesmuller broke into wild weeping her little lena drown herself why had they sent her from home what could be done perhaps it would be too late by the time they could send for her now peter hildesmuller dropped his meerschaum on the walk and it shivered into pieces woman he roared at his wife why did you let that child go away it is your fault if she comes home to us no more every one knew that it was peter hildesmuller s fault so they paid no attention to his words a moment afterward a strange faint voice was heard to call mamma frau hildesmuller at first thought it was lena s spirit calling and then she rushed to the rear of fritz s covered wagon and with a loud shriek of joy caught up lena herself covering her pale little face with kisses and smothering her with hugs lena s eyes were heavy with the deep slumber of exhaustion but she smiled and lay close to the one she had longed to see there among the mail sacks covered in a nest of strange blankets and comforters she had lain asleep until wakened by the voices around her fritz stared at her with eyes that bulged behind his spectacles gott in himmel he shouted how did you get in that wagon am i going crazy as well as to be murdered and hanged by robbers this day you brought her to us fritz cried frau hildesmuller how can we ever thank you enough tell mamma how you came in fritz s wagon said frau hildesmuller i don t know said lena but i know how i got away from the hotel the prince brought me by the emperor s crown shouted fritz we are all going crazy i always knew he would come said lena sitting down on her bundle of bedclothes on the sidewalk last night he came with his armed knights and captured the ogre s castle they broke the dishes and kicked down the doors they pitched mr maloney into a barrel of rain water and threw flour all over mrs maloney the workmen in the hotel jumped out of the windows and ran into the woods when the knights began firing their guns they wakened me up and i peeped down the stair and then the prince came up and wrapped me in the bedclothes and carried me out he was so tall and strong and fine his face was as rough as a scrubbing brush and he talked soft and kind and smelled of schnapps he took me on his horse before him and we rode away among the knights he held me close and i went to sleep that way and didn t wake up till i got home rubbish cried fritz bergmann fairy tales how did you come from the quarries to my wagon the prince brought me said lena confidently and to this day the good people of fredericksburg haven t been able to make her give any other explanation the reformation of calliope calliope catesby was in his humours again ennui was upon him this goodly promontory the earth particularly that portion of it known as quicksand was to him no more than a pestilent congregation of vapours overtaken by the megrims the philosopher may seek relief in soliloquy my lady find solace in tears the flaccid easterner scold at the millinery bills of his women folk such recourse was insufficient to the denizens of quicksand calliope especially was wont to express his ennui according to his lights over night calliope had hung out signals of approaching low spirits he had kicked his own dog on the porch of the occidental hotel and refused to apologise he had become capricious and fault finding in conversation while strolling about he reached often for twigs of mesquite and chewed the leaves fiercely that was always an ominous act another symptom alarming to those who were familiar with the different stages of his doldrums was his increasing politeness and a tendency to use formal phrases a husky softness succeeded the usual penetrating drawl in his tones a dangerous courtesy marked his manners later his smile became crooked the left side of his mouth slanting upward and quicksand got ready to stand from under at this stage calliope generally began to drink finally about midnight he was seen going homeward saluting those whom he met with exaggerated but inoffensive courtesy not yet was calliope s melancholy at the danger point he would seat himself at the window of the room he occupied over silvester s tonsorial parlours and there chant lugubrious and tuneless ballads until morning accompanying the noises by appropriate maltreatment of a jangling guitar more magnanimous than nero he would thus give musical warning of the forthcoming municipal upheaval that quicksand was scheduled to endure a quiet amiable man was calliope catesby at other times quiet to indolence and amiable to worthlessness at best he was a loafer and a nuisance at worst he was the terror of quicksand his ostensible occupation was something subordinate in the real estate line he drove the beguiled easterner in buckboards out to look over lots and ranch property originally he came from one of the gulf states his lank six feet slurring rhythm of speech and sectional idioms giving evidence of his birthplace and yet after taking on western adjustments this languid pine box whittler cracker barrel hugger shady corner lounger of the cotton fields and sumac hills of the south became famed as a bad man among men who had made a life long study of the art of truculence at nine the next morning calliope was fit inspired by his own barbarous melodies and the contents of his jug he was ready primed to gather fresh laurels from the diffident brow of quicksand encircled and criss crossed with cartridge belts abundantly garnished with revolvers and copiously drunk he poured forth into quicksand s main street too chivalrous to surprise and capture a town by silent sortie he paused at the nearest corner and emitted his slogan that fearful brassy yell so reminiscent of the steam piano that had gained for him the classic appellation that had superseded his own baptismal name following close upon his vociferation came three shots from his forty five by way of limbering up the guns and testing his aim a yellow dog the personal property of colonel swazey the proprietor of the occidental fell feet upward in the dust with one farewell yelp a mexican who was crossing the street from the blue front grocery carrying in his hand a bottle of kerosene was stimulated to a sudden and admirable burst of speed still grasping the neck of the shattered bottle the new gilt weather cock on judge riley s lemon and ultramarine two story residence shivered flapped and hung by a splinter the sport of the wanton breezes the artillery was in trim calliope s hand was steady the high calm ecstasy of habitual battle was upon him though slightly embittered by the sadness of alexander in that his conquests were limited to the small world of quicksand down the street went calliope shooting right and left glass fell like hail dogs vamosed chickens flew squawking feminine voices shrieked concernedly to youngsters at large the din was perforated at intervals by the staccato of the terror s guns and was drowned periodically by the brazen screech that quicksand knew so well the occasions of calliope s low spirits were legal holidays in quicksand all along the main street in advance of his coming clerks were putting up shutters and closing doors business would languish for a space the right of way was calliope s and as he advanced observing the dearth of opposition and the few opportunities for distraction his ennui perceptibly increased but some four squares farther down lively preparations were being made to minister to mr catesby s love for interchange of compliments and repartee on the previous night numerous messengers had hastened to advise buck patterson the city marshal of calliope s impending eruption the patience of that official often strained in extending leniency toward the disturber s misdeeds had been overtaxed in quicksand some indulgence was accorded the natural ebullition of human nature providing that the lives of the more useful citizens were not recklessly squandered or too much property needlessly laid waste the community sentiment was against a too strict enforcement of the law but calliope had raised the limit his outbursts had been too frequent and too violent to come within the classification of a normal and sanitary relaxation of spirit buck patterson had been expecting and awaiting in his little ten by twelve frame office that preliminary yell announcing that calliope was feeling blue when the signal came the city marshal rose to his feet and buckled on his guns two deputy sheriffs and three citizens who had proven the edible qualities of fire also stood up ready to bandy with calliope s leaden jocularities gather that fellow in said buck patterson setting forth the lines of the campaign don t have no talk but shoot as soon as you can get a show keep behind cover and bring him down he s a nogood un it s up to calliope to turn up his toes this time i reckon go to him all spraddled out boys and don t git too reckless for what calliope shoots at he hits buck patterson tall muscular and solemn faced with his bright city marshal badge shining on the breast of his blue flannel shirt gave his posse directions for the onslaught upon calliope the plan was to accomplish the downfall of the quicksand terror without loss to the attacking party if possible the splenetic calliope unconscious of retributive plots was steaming down the channel cannonading on either side when he suddenly became aware of breakers ahead the city marshal and one of the deputies rose up behind some dry goods boxes half a square to the front and opened fire at the same time the rest of the posse divided shelled him from two side streets up which they were cautiously manoeuvring from a well executed detour the first volley broke the lock of one of calliope s guns cut a neat underbit in his right ear and exploded a cartridge in his crossbelt scorching his ribs as it burst feeling braced up by this unexpected tonic to his spiritual depression calliope executed a fortissimo note from his upper register and returned the fire like an echo the upholders of the law dodged at his flash but a trifle too late to save one of the deputies a bullet just above the elbow and the marshal a bleeding cheek from a splinter that a ball tore from the box he had ducked behind and now calliope met the enemy s tactics in kind choosing with a rapid eye the street from which the weakest and least accurate fire had come he invaded it at a double quick abandoning the unprotected middle of the street with rare cunning the opposing force in that direction one of the deputies and two of the valorous volunteers waited concealed by beer barrels until calliope had passed their retreat and then peppered him from the rear in another moment they were reinforced by the marshal and his other men and then calliope felt that in order to successfully prolong the delights of the controversy he must find some means of reducing the great odds against him his eye fell upon a structure that seemed to hold out this promise providing he could reach it not far away was the little railroad station its building a strong box house ten by twenty feet resting upon a platform four feet above ground windows were in each of its walls something like a fort it might become to a man thus sorely pressed by superior numbers calliope made a bold and rapid spurt for it the marshal s crowd smoking him as he ran he reached the haven in safety the station agent leaving the building by a window like a flying squirrel as the garrison entered the door patterson and his supporters halted under protection of a pile of lumber and held consultations in the station was an unterrified desperado who was an excellent shot and carried an abundance of ammunition for thirty yards on either side of the besieged was a stretch of bare open ground it was a sure thing that the man who attempted to enter that unprotected area would be stopped by one of calliope s bullets the city marshal was resolved he had decided that calliope catesby should no more wake the echoes of quicksand with his strident whoop he had so announced officially and personally he felt imperatively bound to put the soft pedal on that instrument of discord it played bad tunes standing near was a hand truck used in the manipulation of small freight it stood by a shed full of sacked wool a consignment from one of the sheep ranches on this truck the marshal and his men piled three heavy sacks of wool stooping low buck patterson started for calliope s fort slowly pushing this loaded truck before him for protection the posse scattering broadly stood ready to nip the besieged in case he should show himself in an effort to repel the juggernaut of justice that was creeping upon him only once did calliope make demonstration he fired from a window and some tufts of wool spurted from the marshal s trustworthy bulwark the return shots from the posse pattered against the window frame of the fort no loss resulted on either side the marshal was too deeply engrossed in steering his protected battleship to be aware of the approach of the morning train until he was within a few feet of the platform the train was coming up on the other side of it it stopped only one minute at quicksand what an opportunity it would offer to calliope he had only to step out the other door mount the train and away abandoning his breastwork buck with his gun ready dashed up the steps and into the room driving upon the closed door with one heave of his weighty shoulder the members of the posse heard one shot fired inside and then there was silence at length the wounded man opened his eyes after a blank space he again could see and hear and feel and think turning his eyes about he found himself lying on a wooden bench a tall man with a perplexed countenance wearing a big badge with city marshal engraved upon it stood over him a little old woman in black with a wrinkled face and sparkling black eyes was holding a wet handkerchief against one of his temples he was trying to get these facts fixed in his mind and connected with past events when the old woman began to talk there now great big strong man that bullet never tetched ye jest skeeted along the side of your head and sort of paralysed ye for a spell i ve heerd of sech things afore cun cussion is

veined and calloused hand and took one of her son s then smiling cheerily down at the prostrate man she continued to dip the handkerchief in the waiting room tin washbasin and gently apply it to his temple she had the benevolent garrulity of old age i ain t seen my son before she continued in eight years one of my nephews elkanah price he s a conductor on one of them railroads and he got me a

his eyes steady and keen seemed to linger upon the face of the man standing so still above him his look wandered often from the face he studied to the marshal s badge upon the other s breast yes yes you ll be all right said the old woman patting his arm if you don t get to cuttin up agin and havin folks shooting at you son told me about you sir while you was layin senseless on the floor don t you

you let me advise you sir not to do so no more be a good man and leave liquor alone and live peaceably and goodly keep away from bad company and work honest and sleep sweet the black mitted hand of the old pleader gently touched the breast of the man she addressed very earnest and candid her old worn face looked in her rusty black dress and antique bonnet she sat near the close of a long life and epitomised the experience of the world still the man to whom she spoke gazed above her head contemplating the silent son of the old mother what does the marshal say he asked does he believe the advice is good suppose the marshal speaks up and says if the talk s all right the tall man moved uneasily he fingered the badge on his breast for a moment and then he put an arm around the old woman and drew her close to him she smiled the unchanging mother smile of three score years and patted his big brown hand with her crooked mittened fingers while her son spake i says this he said looking squarely into the eyes of the other man that if i was in your place i d follow it if i was a drunken desp rate character without shame or hope i d follow it if i was in your place and you was in mine i d say marshal i m willin to swear if you ll give me the chance i ll quit the racket i ll drop the tanglefoot and the gun play and won t play hoss no more i ll be a good citizen and go to work and

comin in she never had heard a word bout my tough ways i didn t have the nerve to let her know i was a worthless cuss bein hunted down by the community there you was lyin where my shot laid you like

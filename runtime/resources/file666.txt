artist once discovered a valuable possibility in this street suppose a collector with a bill for paints paper and canvas should in traversing this route suddenly meet himself coming back without a cent having been paid on account so to quaint old greenwich village the art people soon came prowling hunting for north windows and eighteenth century gables and dutch attics and low rents then they imported some pewter mugs and a chafing dish or two from sixth avenue and became a colony at the top of a squatty three story brick sue and johnsy had their studio johnsy was familiar for joanna one was from maine the other from california they had met at the table d hote of an eighth street delmonico s and found their tastes in art chicory salad and bishop sleeves so congenial that the joint studio resulted that was in may in november a cold unseen stranger whom the doctors called pneumonia stalked about the colony touching one here and there with his icy fingers over on the east side this ravager strode boldly smiting his victims by scores but his feet trod slowly through the maze of the narrow and moss grown places mr pneumonia was not what you would call a chivalric old gentleman a mite of a little woman with blood thinned by california zephyrs was hardly fair game for the red fisted short breathed old duffer but johnsy he smote and she lay scarcely moving on her painted iron bedstead looking through the small dutch window panes at the blank side of the next brick house one morning the busy doctor invited sue into the hallway with a shaggy gray eyebrow she has one chance in let us say ten he said as he shook down the mercury in his clinical thermometer and that chance is for her to want to live this way people have of lining up on the side of the undertaker makes the entire pharmacopeia look silly your little lady has made up her mind that she s not going to get well has she anything on her mind she she wanted to paint the bay of naples some day said sue paint bosh has she anything on her mind worth thinking about twice a man for instance a man said sue with a jew s harp twang in her voice is a man worth but no doctor there is nothing of the kind well it is the weakness then said the doctor i will do all that science so far as it may filter through my efforts can accomplish but whenever my patient begins to count the carriages in her funeral procession i subtract per cent from the curative power of medicines if you will get her to ask one question about the new winter styles in cloak sleeves i will promise you a one in five chance for her instead of one in ten after the doctor had gone sue went into the workroom and cried a japanese napkin to a pulp then she swaggered into johnsy s room with her drawing board whistling ragtime johnsy lay scarcely making a ripple under the bedclothes with her face toward the window sue stopped whistling thinking she was asleep she arranged her board and began a pen and ink drawing to illustrate a magazine story young artists must pave their way to art by drawing pictures for magazine stories that young authors write to pave their way to literature as sue was sketching a pair of elegant horseshow riding trousers and a monocle on the figure of the hero an idaho cowboy she heard a low sound several times repeated she went quickly to the bedside johnsy s eyes were open wide she was looking out the window and counting counting backward twelve she said and a little later eleven and then ten and nine and then eight and seven almost together sue looked solicitously out the window what was there to count there was only a bare dreary yard to be seen and the blank side of the brick house twenty feet away an old old ivy vine gnarled and decayed at the roots climbed half way up the brick wall the cold breath of autumn had stricken its leaves from the vine until its skeleton branches clung almost bare to the crumbling bricks what is it dear asked sue six said johnsy in almost a whisper they re falling faster now three days ago there were almost a hundred it made my head ache to count them but now it s easy there goes another one there are only five left now five what dear tell your sudie leaves on the ivy vine when the last one falls i must go too i ve known that for three days didn t the doctor tell you oh i never heard of such nonsense complained sue with magnificent scorn what have old ivy leaves to do with your getting well and you used to love that vine so you naughty girl don t be a goosey why the doctor told me this morning that your chances for getting well real soon were let s see exactly what he said he said the chances were ten to one why that s almost as good a chance as we have in new york when we ride on the street cars or walk past a new building try to take some broth now and let sudie go back to her drawing so she can sell the editor man with it and buy port wine for her sick child and pork chops for her greedy self you needn t get any more wine said johnsy keeping her eyes fixed out the window there goes another no i don t want any broth that leaves just four i want to see the last one fall before it gets dark then i ll go too johnsy dear said sue bending over her

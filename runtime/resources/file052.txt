rest and let me water your horse and stake him with the long rope there is cool water in the jar for you the kid kissed her affectionately not if the court knows itself do i let a lady stake my horse for me said he but if you ll run in chica and throw a pot of coffee together while i attend to the caballo i ll be a good deal obliged besides his marksmanship the kid had another attribute for which he admired himself greatly he was muy caballero as the mexicans express it where the ladies were concerned for them he had always gentle words and consideration he could not have spoken a harsh word to a woman he might ruthlessly slay their husbands and brothers but he could not have laid the weight of a finger in anger upon a woman wherefore many of that interesting division of humanity who had come under the spell of his politeness declared their disbelief in the stories circulated about mr kid one shouldn t believe everything one heard they said when confronted by their indignant men folk with proof of the caballero s deeds of infamy they said maybe he had been driven to it and that he knew how to treat a lady anyhow considering this extremely courteous idiosyncrasy of the kid and the pride he took in it one can perceive that the solution of the problem that was presented to him by what he saw and heard from his hiding place in the pear that afternoon at least as to one of the actors must have been obscured by difficulties and yet one could not think of the kid overlooking little matters of that kind at the end of the short twilight they gathered around a supper of frijoles goat steaks canned peaches and coffee by the light of a lantern in the jacal afterward the ancestor his flock corralled smoked a cigarette and became a mummy in a grey blanket tonia washed the few dishes while the kid dried them with the flour sacking towel her eyes shone she chatted volubly of the inconsequent happenings of her small world since the kid s last visit it was as all his other home comings had been then outside tonia swung in a grass hammock with her guitar and sang sad canciones de amor do you love me just the same old girl asked the kid hunting for his cigarette papers always the same little one said tonia her dark eyes lingering upon him i must go over to fink s said the kid rising for some tobacco i thought i had another sack in my coat i ll be back in a quarter of an hour hasten said tonia and tell me how long shall i call you my own this time will you be gone again to morrow leaving me to grieve or will you be longer with your tonia oh i might stay two or three days this trip said the kid yawning i ve been on the dodge for a month and i d like to rest up he was gone half an hour for his tobacco when he returned tonia was still lying in the hammock it s funny said the kid how i feel i feel like there was somebody lying behind every bush and tree waiting to shoot me i never had mullygrubs like them before maybe it s one of them presumptions i ve got half a notion to light out in the morning before day the guadalupe country is burning up about that old dutchman i plugged down there you are not afraid no one could make my brave little one fear well i haven t been usually regarded as a jack rabbit when it comes to scrapping but i don t want a posse smoking me out when i m in your jacal somebody might get hurt that oughtn t to remain with your tonia no one will find you here the kid looked keenly into the shadows up and down the arroyo and toward the dim lights of the mexican village i ll see how it looks later on was his decision at midnight a horseman rode into the rangers camp blazing his way by noisy halloes to indicate a pacific mission sandridge and one or two others turned out to investigate the row the rider announced himself to be domingo sales from the lone wolf crossing he bore a letter for senor sandridge old luisa the lavendera had persuaded him to bring it he said her son gregorio being too ill of a fever to ride sandridge lighted the camp lantern and read the letter these were its words dear one he has come hardly had you ridden away when he came out of the pear when he first talked he said he would stay three days or more then as it grew later he was like a wolf or a fox and walked about without rest looking and listening soon he said he must leave before daylight when it is dark and stillest and then he seemed to suspect that i be not true to him he looked at me so strange that i am frightened i swear to him that i love him his own tonia last of all he said i must prove to him i am true he thinks that even now men are waiting to kill him as he rides from my house to escape he says he will dress in my clothes my red skirt and the blue waist i wear and the brown mantilla over the head and thus ride away but before that he says that i must put on his clothes his pantalones and camisa and hat and ride away on his horse from the jacal as far as the big road beyond the crossing and back again this before he goes so he can tell

way back into the banking room the examiner astounded perplexed nettled at sea followed he felt that he had been made the victim of something that was not exactly a hoax but that left him in the shoes of one who had been played upon used and then discarded without even an inkling of the game perhaps also his official position had been irreverently juggled with but there was nothing he could take hold of an official report of the matter would be an absurdity and somehow he felt that he would never know anything more about the matter than he did then frigidly mechanically nettlewick examined the securities found them to tally with the notes gathered his black wallet and rose to depart i will say he protested turning the indignant glare of his glasses upon major kingman that your statements your misleading statements which you have not condescended to explain do not appear to be quite the thing regarded either as business or humour i do not understand such motives or actions major tom looked down at him serenely and not unkindly son he said there are plenty of things in the chaparral and on the prairies and up the canyons that you don t understand but i want to thank you for listening to a garrulous old man s prosy story we old texans love to talk about our adventures and our old comrades and the home folks have long ago learned to run when we begin with once upon a time so we have to spin our yarns to the stranger within our gates the major smiled but the examiner only bowed coldly and abruptly quitted the bank they saw him travel diagonally across the street in

like a twinkle in his eyes he read it again these were the words he read dear tom i hear there s one of uncle sam s grayhounds going through you and that means that we ll catch him inside of a couple of hours maybe now i want you to do something for me we ve got just in the bank and the law requires that we have i let ross and fisher have late yesterday afternoon to buy up that gibson bunch of cattle they ll realise in less than thirty days on the transaction but that won t make my cash on hand look any prettier to that bank examiner now i can t show him those notes for they re just plain notes of hand without any security in sight but you know very well that pink ross and jim fisher are two of the finest white men god ever made and they ll do the square thing you remember jim fisher he was the one who shot that faro dealer in el paso i wired sam bradshaw s bank to send me and it will get in on the narrow gauge at you can t let a bank examiner in to count and close your doors tom you hold that examiner hold him hold him if you have to rope him and sit on his head watch our front window after the narrow gauge gets in and when we ve got the cash inside we ll pull down the shade for a signal don t turn him loose till then i m counting on you tom your old pard bob buckly prest stockmen s national the major began to tear the note into small pieces and throw them into his waste

comes from going to and fro upon the earth and walking up and down in it to morrow morning while you are cracking your breakfast egg he may be off with his little alligator grip to boom a town site in the middle of lake okeechobee or to trade horses with the patagonians we sat at a little round table and between us were glasses holding big lumps of ice and above us leaned an artificial palm and because our scene was set with the properties of the one they recalled to his mind billy was stirred to narrative it reminds me said he of a fourth i helped to celebrate down in salvador twas while i was running an ice factory down there after i unloaded that silver mine i had in colorado i had what they called a conditional concession they made me put up a thousand dollars cash forfeit that i would make ice continuously for six months if i did that i could draw down my ante if i failed to do so the government took the pot so the inspectors kept dropping in trying to catch me without the goods one day when the thermometer was at the clock at half past one and the calendar at july third two of the little brown oily nosers in red trousers slid in to make an inspection now the factory hadn t turned out a pound of ice in three weeks for a couple of reasons the salvador heathen wouldn t buy it they said it make things cold they put it in and i couldn t make any more because i was

at their stores on canal chartres st charles and royal streets a quiet young man with a little bald spot on the top of his head distinguished manners and the eye of a connoisseur who explained what he wanted to hire the complete and elegant equipment of a dining room hall reception room and cloak rooms the goods were to be packed and sent by boat to the charleroi landing and would be returned within three or four days all damage or loss to be promptly paid for many of those old merchants knew grandemont by sight and the charleses of old by association some of them were of creole stock and felt a thrill of responsive sympathy with the magnificently indiscreet design of this impoverished clerk who would revive but for a moment the ancient flame of glory with the fuel of his savings

forced to pass with his six hundred he stood before them as a child with a penny stands before a french doll but he bought with taste and discretion of other wines chablis moselle chateau d or

wide his laughter as ready as ever grandemont told him of his plan and the old chef swayed with pride and delight with a sigh of relief knowing that he need have no further concern until the serving of that dinner was announced he placed in andre s hands a liberal sum for the cost of it giving carte blanche for its creation among the blacks were also a number of the old house servants absalom the former major domo and a half dozen of the younger men once waiters and attaches of the kitchen pantry and other domestic departments crowded around to greet m shi grande absalom guaranteed to marshal

shapeless bundles and bales and packets swathed in cloth and bound with ropes tubs and urns of palms evergreens and tropical flowers tables mirrors chairs couches carpets and pictures all carefully bound and padded against the dangers of transit grandemont was among them the busiest there to the safe conveyance of certain large hampers eloquent with printed cautions to delicate handling he gave his superintendence for they contained the fragile china and glassware the dropping of one of those hampers would have cost him more than he could have saved in a year the last article unloaded the

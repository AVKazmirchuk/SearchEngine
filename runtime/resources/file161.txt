the word that went round among the paper box girls pipe mag s floor walker thus the give and takes expressed their indifferent contempt usually at the weekly hops maggie kept a spot on the wall warm with her back she felt and showed so much gratitude whenever a self sacrificing partner invited her to dance that his pleasure was cheapened and diminished she had even grown used to noticing anna joggle the reluctant jimmy with her elbow as a signal for him to invite her chum to walk over his feet through a two step but to night the pumpkin had turned to a coach and six terry o sullivan was a victorious prince charming and maggie toole winged her first butterfly flight and though our tropes of fairyland be mixed with those of entomology they shall not spill one drop of ambrosia from the rose crowned melody of maggie s one perfect night the girls besieged her for introductions to her fellow the clover leaf young men after two years of blindness suddenly perceived charms in miss toole they flexed their compelling muscles before her and bespoke her for the dance thus she scored but to terry o sullivan the honours of the evening fell thick and fast he shook his curls he smiled and went easily through the seven motions for acquiring grace in your own room before an open window ten minutes each day he danced like a faun he introduced manner and style and atmosphere his words came trippingly upon his tongue and he waltzed twice in succession with the paper box girl that dempsey donovan brought dempsey was the leader of the association he wore a dress suit and could chin the bar twice with one hand he was one of big mike o sullivan s lieutenants and was never troubled by trouble no cop dared to arrest him whenever be broke a pushcart man s head or shot a member of the heinrick b sweeney outing and literary association in the kneecap an officer would drop around and say the cap n d like to see ye a few minutes round to the office whin ye have time dempsey me boy but

big mike o sullivan shone at the door for five minutes upon the scene he always looked in for five minutes smiled at the girls and handed out real perfectos to the delighted boys dempsey donovan was at his elbow instantly talking rapidly big mike looked carefully at the dancers smiled shook his head and departed the music stopped the dancers scattered to the chairs along the walls terry o sullivan with his entrancing bow relinquished a pretty girl in blue to her partner and started back to find maggie dempsey intercepted him in the middle of the floor some fine instinct that rome must have bequeathed to us caused nearly every one to turn and look at them there was a subtle feeling that two gladiators had met in the arena two or three give and takes with tight coat sleeves drew nearer one moment mr o sullivan said dempsey i hope you re enjoying yourself where did you say you live the two gladiators were well matched dempsey had perhaps ten pounds of weight to give away the o sullivan had breadth with quickness dempsey had a glacial eye a dominating slit of a mouth an indestructible jaw a complexion like a belle s and the coolness of a champion the visitor showed more fire in his contempt and less control over his conspicuous sneer they were enemies by the law written when the rocks were molten they were each too splendid too mighty too incomparable to divide pre eminence one only must survive i live on grand said o sullivan insolently and no trouble to find me at home where do you live dempsey ignored the question you say your name s o sullivan he went on well big mike says he never saw you before lots of things he never saw said the favourite of the hop as a rule went on dempsey huskily sweet o sullivans in this district know one another you escorted one of our lady members here and we want chance to make good if you ve got a family tree let s see a few historical o sullivan buds come out on it or do you want us to dig it out of you by the roots suppose you mind your own business suggested o sullivan blandly dempsey s eye brightened he held up an inspired forefinger as though a brilliant idea had struck him i ve got it now he said cordially it was just a little mistake you ain t no o sullivan you are a ring tailed monkey excuse us for not recognising you at first o sullivan s eye flashed he made a quick movement but andy geoghan was

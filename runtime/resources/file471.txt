of sudden rain in every little cry of bird i hear a tracking shout from every sodden leaf that s stirred i see a face frown out my soul shakes when the water rat cowed by the blue snake flies black knots from tree holes glimmer at me with accusive eyes through all the murky silence rings a cry not born of earth an endless deep unechoing thing that owns not human birth i see no colors in the sky save red as blood is red i pray to god to still that cry from pallid lips and dead one spot in all that stagnant waste i shun as moles shun light and turn my prow to make all haste to fly before the night a poisonous mound hid from the sun where crabs hold revelry where eels and fishes feed upon the thing that once was he at night i steal along the shore within my hut i creep but awful stars blink through the door to hold me from my sleep the river gurgles like his throat in little choking coves and loudly dins that phantom note from out the awful groves i shout with laughter through the night i rage in greatest glee my fears all vanish with the light oh splendid nights they be i see her weep she calls his name he answers not nor will my soul with joy is all aflame i laugh and laugh and thrill i count her teardrops as they fall i flout my daytime fears i mumble thanks to god for all these gibes and happy jeers but when the warning dawn awakes begins my wandering with stealthy strokes through tangled brakes a wasted frightened thing two portraits wild hair flying in a matted maze hand firm as iron eyes all ablaze bystanders timidly breathlessly gaze as o er the keno board boldly he plays that s texas bill wild hair flying in a matted maze hand firm as iron eyes all ablaze bystanders timidly breathlessly gaze as o er the keyboard boldly he plays that s paderewski a contribution there came unto ye editor a poet pale and wan and at the table sate him down a roll within his hand ye editor accepted it and thanked his lucky fates ye poet had to yield it up to a king full on eights the old farm just now when the whitening blossoms flare on the apple trees and the growing grass creeps forth and a balm is in the air with my lighted pipe and well filled glass of the old farm i am dreaming and softly smiling seeming to see the bright sun beaming upon the old home farm and when i think how we milked the cows and hauled the hay from the meadows low and walked the furrows behind the plows and chopped the cotton to make it grow i d much rather be here dreaming and smiling only seeming to see the hot sun gleaming upon the old home farm vanity a poet sang so wondrous sweet that toiling thousands paused and listened long so lofty strong and noble were his themes it seemed that strength supernal swayed his song he god like chided poor weak weeping man and bade him dry his foolish shameful tears taught that each soul on its proud self should lean and from that rampart scorn all earth born fears the poet grovelled on a fresh heaped mound raised o er the clay of one he d fondly loved and cursed the world and drenched the sod with tears and all the flimsy mockery of his precepts proved the lullaby boy the lullaby boy to the same old tune who abandons his drum and toys for the purpose of dying in early june is the kind the public enjoys but just for a change please sing us a song of the sore toed boy that s fly and freckled and mean and ugly and bad and positively will not die chanson de boheme lives of great men all remind us rose is red and violet s blue johnny s got his gun behind us cause the lamb loved mary too robert burns hocht time in the aud town i d rather write this as bad as it is than be will shakespeare s shade i d rather be known as an f f v than in mount vernon laid i d rather count ties from denver to troy than to head booth s old programme i d rather be special for the new york world than to lie with abraham for there s stuff in the can there s dolly and fan and a hundred things to choose there s a kiss in the ring and every old thing that a real live man can use i d rather fight flies in a boarding house than fill napoleon s grave and snuggle up warm in my three slat bed than be andre the brave i d rather distribute a coat of red on the town with a wad of dough just now than to have my cognomen spelled michael angelo for a small live man if he s prompt on hand when the good things pass around while the world s on tap has a better snap than a big man under ground hard to forget i m thinking to night of the old farm ned and my heart is heavy and sad as i think of the days that by have fled since i was a little lad there rises before me each spot i know of the old home in the dell the fields and woods and meadows below that memory holds so well the city is pleasant and lively ned but what to us is its charm to night all my thoughts are fixed instead on our childhood s old home farm i know you are thinking the same dear ned with your head bowed on

out praise the saints this noight is and oh yer reverence the swate beautiful drame of a dress she had this toime white satin and silk and ribbons and lace about the neck and arrums twas a sin yer reverence the gold was spint upon it the priest heard lorison catch his breath painfully and a faint smile flickered across his own clean cut mouth well then mistress geehan said he i ll just step upstairs and see the bit boy for a minute and i ll take this gentleman up with me he s awake thin said the woman i ve just come down from sitting wid him the last hour tilling him fine shtories of ould county tyrone tis a greedy gos soon it is yer riverence for me shtories small the doubt said father rogan there s no rocking would put him to slape the quicker i m thinking amid the woman s shrill protest against the retort the two men ascended the steep stairway the priest pushed open the door of a room near its top is that you already sister drawled a sweet childish voice from the darkness it s only ould father denny come to see ye darlin and a foine gentleman i ve brought to make ye a gr r and call and ye resaves us fast aslape in bed shame on yez manners oh father denny is that you i m glad and will you light the lamp please it s on the table by the door and quit talking like mother geehan father denny the priest lit the lamp and lorison saw a tiny towsled haired boy with a thin delicate face sitting up in a small bed in a corner quickly also his rapid glance con sidered the room and its contents it was furnished with more than comfort and its adornments plainly indicated a woman s discerning taste an open door beyond revealed the blackness of an adjoining room s interior the boy clutched both of father rogan s hands i m so glad you came he said but why did you come in the night did sister send you off wid ye am i to be sint about at me age as was terence mcshane of ballymahone i come on me own r r responsibility lorison had also advanced to the boy s bedside he was fond of children and the wee fellow laving himself down to sleep alone ill that dark room stirred his heart aren t you afraid little man he asked stooping down beside him sometimes answered the boy with a shy smile when the rats make too much noise but nearly every night when sister goes out molt her geehan stays a while with me and tells me funny stories i m not often afraid sir this brave little gentleman said father rogan is a scholar of mine every day from half past six to half past eight when sister comes for him he stops in my study and we find out what s in the inside of books he knows multiplication division and fractions and he s troubling me to begin wid the chronicles of ciaran of clonmaciioise corurac mccullenan and cuan o loc hain the gr r reat irish histhorians the boy was evidently accustomed to the priest s celtic pleasantries a little appreciative grin was all the attention the insin nation of pedantry received lorison to have saved his life could not have put to the child one of those vital questions that were wildly beating about unanswered in his own brain the little fellow was very like norah he had the same shining hair and candid eyes oh father denny cried the boy suddenly i forgot to tell you sister is not going away at night any more she told me so when she kissed me good night as she was leaving and she said she was so

again wait till i get the sassenach into the annals of tageruach the hagiographer i ll give him enough of the irish idiom to make him more respectful the light was out and the small brave voice bidding them good night from the dark room they groped downstairs and tore away from the garrulity of mother geehan again the priest steered them through the dim ways but this time in another direction his conductor was serenely silent and lorison followed his example to the extent of seldom speaking serene he could not be his heart beat suffocatingly in his breast the following of this blind menacing trail was pregnant with he knew not what humiliating revelation to be delivered at its end they came into a more pretentious street where trade it could be surmised flourished by day and again the priest paused this time before a lofty building whose great doors and windows in the lowest floor were carefully shuttered and barred its higher apertures were dark save in the third story the windows of which were bril liantly lighted lorison s ear caught a distant regular pleasing thrumming as of music above they stood at an angle of the building up along the side nearest them mounted an iron stairway at its top was an upright illuminated parallelogram father rogan had stopped and stood musing i will say this much he remarked thoughtfully i believe you to be a better man than you think yourself to be and a better man than i thought some hours ago but do not take this he added with a smile as much praise i promised you a possible deliverance from an unhappy perplexity

the other would be crazy for balls and theatres and late suppers no my dear friend while it isn t exactly january and may it s a clear case of october and pretty early in june i d always do what you wanted me to do theo if you wanted to no you wouldn t you think now that you would but you wouldn t please don t ask me any more the captain had lost his battle but he was a gallant warrior and when he rose to make his final adieu his mouth was grimly set and his shoulders were squared he took the train for the north that night on the next evening he was back in his room where his sword was hanging against the wall he was dressing for dinner tying his white tie into a very careful bow and at the same time he was indulging in a pensive soliloquy pon my honour i believe theo was right after all nobody can deny that she s a peach but she must be twenty eight at the very kindest calculation for you see the captain was only nineteen and his sword had never been drawn except on the parade ground at chattanooga which was as near as he ever got to the spanish american war the church with an overshot wheel lakelands is not to be found in the catalogues of fashionable summer resorts it lies on a low spur of the cumberland range of mountains on a little tributary of the clinch river lakelands proper is a contented village of two dozen houses situated on a forlorn narrow gauge railroad line you wonder whether the railroad lost itself in the pine woods and ran into lakelands from fright and loneliness or whether lakelands got lost and huddled itself along the railroad to wait for the ears to carry it home you wonder again why it was named lakelands there are no lakes and the lands about are too poor to be worth mentioning half a mile from the village stands the eagle house a big roomy old mansion run by josiah rankin for the accommodation of visitors who desire the mountain air at inexpensive rates the eagle house is delightfully mismanaged it is full of ancient instead of modern improvements and it is altogether as comfortably neglected and pleasingly disarranged as your own home but you are furnished with clean rooms and good and abundant fare yourself and the piny woods must do the rest nature has provided a mineral spring grape vine swings and croquet even the wickets are wooden you have art to thank only for the fiddle and guitar music twice a week at the hop in the rustic pavilion the patrons of the eagle house are those who seek recreation as a necessity as well as a pleasure they are busy people who may be likened to clocks that need a fortnight s winding to insure a year s running of their wheels you will find students there from the lower towns now and then an artist or a geologist absorbed in construing the ancient strata of the hills a few quiet families spend the summers there and often one or two tired members of that patient sisterhood known to lakelands as schoolmarms a quarter of a mile from the eagle house was what would have been described to its guests as an object of interest in the catalogue had the eagle house issued a catalogue this was an old old mill that was no longer a mill in the words of josiah rankin it was the only church in the united states sah with an overshot wheel and the only mill in the world sah with pews and a pipe organ the guests of the eagle house attended the old mill church each sabbath and heard the preacher liken the purified christian to bolted flour ground to usefulness between the millstones of experience and suffering every year about the beginning of autumn there came to the eagle house one abram strong who remained for a time an honoured and beloved guest in lakelands he was called father abram because his hair was so white his face so strong and kind and florid his laugh so merry and his black clothes and broad hat so priestly in appearance even new guests after three or four days acquaintance gave him this familiar title father abram came a long way to lakelands he lived in a big roaring town in the northwest where he owned mills not little mills with pews and an organ in them but great ugly mountain like mills that the freight trains crawled around all day like ants around an ant heap and now you must be told about father abram and the mill that was a church for their stories run together in the days when the church was a mill mr strong was the miller there was no jollier dustier busier happier miller in all the land than he he lived in a little cottage across the road from the mill his hand was heavy but his toll was light and the mountaineers brought their grain to him across many weary miles of rocky roads the delight of the miller s life was his little daughter aglaia that was a brave name truly for a flaxen haired toddler but the mountaineers love sonorous and stately names the mother had encountered it somewhere in a book and the deed was done in her babyhood aglaia herself repudiated the name as far as common use went and persisted in calling herself dums the miller and his wife often tried to coax from aglaia the source of this mysterious name but without results at last they arrived at a theory in the little garden behind the cottage was a bed of rhododendrons in which the child took a peculiar delight and interest it may have been that she perceived

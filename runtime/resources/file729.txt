board fence surrounded by cats the other a wash of clothes was suspended high upon a line stretched from diagonal corners those were property clothes and were never taken in by tonio they were there that wits with defective pronuncia tion might make puns in connection with the ragout a dozen and a half little tables set upon the bare ground were crowded with bohemia hunters who flocked there because tonio pretended not to want them and pretended to give them a good dinner there was a sprinkling of real bohemians present who came for a change because they were tired of the real bohemia and a smart shower of the men who originate the bright sayings of congressmen and the little nephew of the well known general passen ger agent of the evansville and terre haute rail road company here is a bon mot that was manufactured at tonio s a dinner at tonio s said a bohemian always amounts to twice the price that is asked for it let us assume that an accommodating voice in quires how so the dinner costs you cents you give cents to the waiter and it makes you feel like cents most of the diners were confirmed table d hoters gastronomic adventuress forever seeking the el do rado of a good claret and consistently coming to grief in california mr brunelli escorted katy to a little table em bowered with shrubbery in tubs and asked her to excuse him for a while katy sat enchanted by a scene so brilliant to her the grand ladies in splendid dresses and plumes and sparkling rings the fine gentlemen who laughed so loudly the cries of garsong and we mon seer and hello mame that distinguish bo hemia the lively chatter the cigarette smoke the interchange of bright smiles and eye glances all this display and magnificence overpowered the daugh ter of mrs dempsey and held her motionless mr brunelli stepped into the yard and seemed to spread his smile and bow over the entire company and everywhere there was a great clapping of bands and a few cries of bravo and tonio tonio whatever those words might mean ladies waved their napkins at him gentlemen almost twisted their necks off trying to catch his nod when the ovation was concluded mr brunelli with a final bow stepped

irish stew on the dempsey table had been particu larly weak that day delicious odors from unknown dishes tantalized her and flaherty began to bring to her table course after course of ambrosial food that the gods might have pronounced excellent but even in the midst of her lucullian repast katy laid down her knife and fork her heart sank as lead and a tear fell upon her filet mignon her haunting suspicions of the star lodger arose again fourfold thus courted and admired and smiled upon by that fashionable and gracious assembly what else could mr brunelli be but one of those dazzling titled

tonio came to test it to prove the sauce and add the needful dash of seasoning that gave it perfection from table to table moved tonio like a prince in his palace greeting his guests white jewelled bands signalled him from every side a glass of wine with this one and that smiles for all a jest and repartee for any that might challenge truly few princes could be so agreeable a host and what artist could ask for further appreciation of his handiwork katy did not know that the proudest consummation of a new yorker s ambition is to shake bands with a spaghetti chef or to receive a nod from a broadway head waiter at last the company thinned leaving but a few couples and quartettes lingering over new wine and old stories and then came mr brunelli to katy s secluded table and drew a chair close to hers katy smiled at him dreamily she was eating the last spoonful of a raspberry roll with burgundy sauce you have seen said mr brunelli laying one hand upon his collar bone i am antonio brunelli yes i am the great tonio you have not suspect that i loave you katy and you shall marry with me is it not so call me antonio and say that you will be mine katy s head drooped to the shoulder

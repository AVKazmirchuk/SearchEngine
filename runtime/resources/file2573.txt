treading man finely dressed who pauses a second before the curtains and then passes on presently comes the waiter with a message mr rolfe says tell rolfe i m engaged i don t know why it is says goodall of memphis but i don t feel as bad as i did an hour ago i wanted to die but since i ve met you miss rosa i d like so much to live the young woman whirls around the table lays an arm behind his neck and kisses him on the cheek you must dear boy she says i know what was the matter it was the miserable foggy weather that has lowered your spirit and mine too a little but look now with a little spring she has drawn back the curtains a window is in the wall opposite and lo the mist is cleared away the indulgent moon is out again revoyaging the plumbless sky roof and parapet and spire are softly pearl enamelled twice thrice the retrieved river flashes back between the houses the light of the firmament a tonic day will dawn sweet and prosperous talk of death when the world is so beautiful says miss rosa laying her hand on his shoulder do something to please me walter go home to your rest and say i mean to get better and do it if you ask it says the boy with a smile i will the waiter brings full glasses did they ring no but it is well he may leave them a farewell glass miss rosa says to your better health walter he says to our next meeting his eyes look no longer into the void but gaze upon the antithesis of death his foot is set in an undiscovered country to night he is obedient ready to go good night she says i never kissed a girl before he confesses except my sisters you didn t this time she laughs i kissed you good night when shall i see you again he persists you promised me to go home she frowns and get well perhaps we shall meet again soon good night he hesitates his hat in hand she smiles broadly and kisses him once more upon the forehead she watches him far down the aisle then sits again at the table the shadow falls once more against the wall this time the big softly stepping man parts the curtains and looks in miss rosa s eyes meet his and for half a minute they remain thus silent fighting a battle with that king of weapons presently the big man drops the curtains and passes on the orchestra ceases playing suddenly and an important voice can be heard loudly talking in one of the boxes farther down the aisle no doubt some citizen entertains there some visitor to the town and miss rosa leans back in her chair and smiles at some of the words she catches purest atmosphere in the world litmus paper all long nothing hurtful our city nothing but pure ozone the waiter returns for the tray and glasses as he enters the girl crushes a little empty pasteboard box in her hand and throws it in a corner she is stirring something in her glass with her hatpin why miss rosa says the waiter with the civil familiarity he uses putting salt in your beer this early in the night the friendly call published in monthly magazine section july when i used to sell hardware in the west i often made a little town called saltillo in colorado i was always certain of securing a small or a large order from simon bell who kept a general store there bell was one of those six foot low voiced products formed from a union of the west and the south i liked him to look at him you would think he should be robbing stage coaches or juggling gold mines with both hands but he would sell you a paper of tacks or a spool of thread with ten times more patience and courtesy than any saleslady in a city department store i had a twofold object in my last visit to saltillo one was to sell a bill of goods the other to advise bell of a chance that i knew of by which i was certain he could make a small fortune in mountain city a town on the union pacific five times larger than saltillo a mercantile firm was about to go to the wall it had a lively and growing custom but was on the edge of dissolution and ruin mismanagement and the gambling habits of one of the partners explained it the condition of the firm was not yet public property i had my knowledge of it from a private source i knew that if the ready cash were offered the stock and good will could be bought for about one fourth their value on arriving in saltillo i went to bell s store he nodded to me smiled his broad lingering smile went on leisurely selling some candy to a little girl then came around the counter and shook hands well he said his invariably preliminary jocosity fit every call i made i suppose you are out here making kodak pictures of the mountains it s the wrong time of the year to buy any hardware of course i told bell about the bargain in mountain city if he wanted to take advantage of it i would rather have missed a sale than have him overstocked in saltillo it sounds good he said with enthusiasm i d like to branch out and do a bigger business and i m obliged to you for mentioning it but well you come and stay at my house to night and i ll think about it it was then after sundown and time for the larger stores in saltillo to close the clerks in bell s put away their books whirled the combination of the safe put on their coats and hats and left for their homes bell padlocked the big double wooden front doors and we stood for a moment breathing the keen fresh mountain air coming across the foothills a big man walked down the street and stopped in front of the high porch of the store his long black moustache black eyebrows and curly black hair contrasted queerly with his light pink complexion which belonged by rights to a blonde he was about forty and wore a white vest a white hat a watch chain made of five dollar gold pieces linked together and a rather well fitting two piece gray suit of the cut that college boys of eighteen are wont to affect he glanced at me distrustfully and then at bell with coldness and i thought something of enmity in his expression well asked bell as if he were addressing a stranger did you fix up that matter did i the man answered in a resentful tone what do you suppose i ve been here two weeks for the business is to be settled to night does that suit you or have you got something to kick about it s all right said bell i knew you d do it of course you did said the magnificent stranger haven t i done it before you have admitted bell and so have i how do you find it at the hotel rocky grub but i ain t kicking say can you give me any pointers about managing that affair it s my first deal in that line of business you know no i can t answered bell after some thought i ve tried all kinds of ways you ll have to try some of your own tried soft soap barrels of it tried a saddle girth with a buckle on the end of it never none started to once and here s what i got bill held out his right hand even in the deepening twilight i could see on the back of it a long white scar that might have been made by a claw or a knife or some sharp edged tool oh well said the florid man carelessly i ll know what to do later on he walked away without another word when he had gone ten steps he turned and called to bell you keep well out of the way when the goods are delivered so there won t be any hitch in the business all right answered bell i ll attend to my end of the line this talk was scarcely clear in its meaning to me but as it did not concern me i did not let it weigh upon my mind but the singularity of the other man s appearance lingered with me for a while and as we walked toward bell s house i remarked to him your customer seems to be a surly kind of fellow not one that you d like to be snowed in with in a camp on a hunting trip he is that assented bell heartily he reminds me of a rattlesnake that s been poisoned by the bite of a tarantula he doesn t look like a citizen of saltillo i went on no said bell he lives in sacramento he s down here on a little business trip his name is george ringo and he s been my best friend in fact the only friend i ever had for twenty years i was too surprised to make any further comment bell lived in a comfortable plain square two story white house on the edge of the little town i waited in the parlor a room depressingly genteel furnished with red plush straw matting looped up lace curtains and a glass case large enough to contain a mummy full of mineral specimens while i waited i heard upstairs that unmistakable sound instantly recognized the world over a bickering woman s voice rising as her anger and fury grew i could hear between the gusts the temperate rumble of bell s tones striving to oil the troubled waters the storm subsided soon but not before i had heard the woman say in a lower concentrated tone rather more carrying than her high pitched railings this is the last time i tell you the last time oh you will understand the household seemed to consist of only bell and his wife and a servant or two i was introduced to mrs bell at supper at first sight she seemed to be a handsome woman but i soon perceived that her charm had been spoiled an uncontrolled petulance i thought and emotional egotism an absence of poise and a habitual dissatisfaction had marred her womanhood during the meal she showed that false gayety spurious kindliness and reactionary softness that mark the woman addicted to tantrums withal she was a woman who might be attractive to many men after supper bell and i took our chairs outside set them on the grass in the moonlight and smoked the full moon is a witch in her light truthful men dig up for you nuggets of purer gold while liars squeeze out brighter colors from the tubes of their invention i saw bell s broad slow smile come out upon his face and linger there i reckon you think george and me are a funny kind of friends he said the fact is we never did take much interest in each other s company but his idea and mine of what a friend should be was always synonymous and we lived up to it strict all these years now i ll give you an idea of what our idea is a man don t need but one friend the fellow who drinks your liquor and hangs around you slapping you on the back and taking up your time telling you how much he likes you ain t a friend even if you did play marbles at school and fish in the same creek with him as long as you don t need a friend one of that kind may answer but a friend to my mind is one you can deal with on a strict reciprocity basis like me and george have always done a good many years ago him and me was connected in a number of ways we put our capital together and run a line of freight wagons in new mexico and we mined some and gambled a few and then we got into trouble of one or two kinds and i reckon that got us on a better understandable basis than anything else did unless it was the fact that we never had much personal use for each other s ways george is the vainest man i ever see and the biggest brag he could blow the biggest geyser in the yosemite valley back into its hole with one whisper i am a quiet man and fond of studiousness and thought the more we used to see each other personally the less we seemed to like to be together if he ever had slapped me on the back and snivelled over me like i ve seen men do to what they called their friends i know i d have had a rough and tumble with him on the spot same way with george he hated my ways as bad as i did his when we were mining we lived in separate tents so as not to intrude our obnoxiousness on each other but after a long time we begun to know each of us could depend on the other when we were in a pinch up to his last dollar word of honor or perjury bullet or drop of blood we had in the world we never even spoke of it to each other because that would have spoiled it but we tried it out time after time until we came to know i ve grabbed my hat and jumped a freight and rode miles to identify him when he was about to be hung by mistake in idaho for a train robber once i laid sick of typhoid in a tent in texas without a dollar or a change of clothes and sent for george in boise city he came on the next train the first thing he did before speaking to me was to hang up a little looking glass on the side of the tent and curl his moustache and rub some hair dye on his head his hair is naturally a light reddish then he gave me the most scientific cussing i ever had and took off his coat if you wasn t a moses meek little mary s lamb you wouldn t have been took down this way says he haven t you got gumption enough not to drink swamp water or fall down and scream whenever you have a little colic or feel a mosquito bite you he made me a little mad you ve got the bedside manners of a piute medicine man says i and i wish you d go away and let me die a natural death i m sorry i sent for you i ve a mind to says george for nobody cares whether you live or die but now i ve been tricked into coming i might as well stay until this little attack of indigestion or nettle rash or whatever it is passes away two weeks afterward when i was beginning to get around again the doctor laughed and said he was sure that my friend s keeping me mad all the time did more than his drugs to cure me so that s the way george and me was friends there wasn t any sentiment about it it was just give and take and each of us knew that the other was ready for the call at any time i remember once i played a sort of joke on george just to try him i felt a little mean about it afterward because i never ought to have doubted he d do it we was both living in a little town in the san luis valley running some flocks of sheep and a few cattle we were partners but as usual we didn t live together i had an old aunt out from the east visiting for the summer so i rented a little cottage she soon had a couple of cows and some pigs and chickens to make the place look like home george lived alone in a little cabin half a mile out of town one day a calf that we had died that night i broke its bones dumped it into a coarse sack and tied it up with wire i put on an old shirt tore a sleeve most out of it and the collar half off tangled up my hair put some red ink on my hands and spashed some of it over my shirt and face i must have looked like i d been having the fight of my life i put the sack in a wagon and drove out to george s cabin when i halloed he came out in a yellow dressing gown a turkish cap and patent leather shoes george always was a great dresser i dumped the bundle to the ground sh sh says i kind of wild in my way take that and bury it george out somewhere behind your house bury it just like it is and don don t get excited says george and for the lord s sake go and wash your hands and face and put on a clean shirt and he lights his pipe while i drive away at a gallop the next morning he drops around to our cottage where my aunt was fiddling with her flowers and truck in the front yard he bends himself and bows and makes compliments as be could do when so disposed and begs a rose bush from her saying he had turned up a little land back of his cabin and wanted to plant something on it by way of usefulness and ornament so my aunt flattered pulls up one of her biggest by the roots and gives it to him afterward i see it growing where he planted it in a place where the grass had been cleared off and the dirt levelled but neither george nor me ever spoke of it to each other again the moon rose higher possibly drawing water from the sea pixies from their dells and certainly more confidences from simms bell the friend of a friend there come a time not long afterward he went on when i was able to do a good turn for george ringo george had made a little pile of money in beeves and he was up in denver and he showed up when i saw him wearing deer skin vests yellow shoes clothes like the awnings in front of drug stores and his hair dyed so blue that it looked black in the dark he wrote me to come up there quick that he needed me and to bring the best outfit of clothes i had i had em on when i got the letter so i left on the next train george was bell stopped for half a minute listening intently i thought i heard a team coming down the road he explained george was at a summer resort on a lake near denver and was putting on as many airs as he knew how he had rented a little two room cottage and had a chihauhau dog and a hammock and eight different kinds of walking sticks simms he says to me there s a widow woman here that s pestering the soul out of me with her intentions i can t get out of her way it ain t that she ain t handsome and agreeable in a sort of style but her attentions is serious and i ain t ready for to marry nobody and settle down i can t go to no festivity nor sit on the hotel piazza or mix in any of the society round ups but what she cuts me out of the herd and puts her daily brand on me i like this here place goes on george and i m making a hit here in the most censorious circles so i don t want to have to run away from it so i sent for you what do you want me to do i asks george why says he i want you to head her off i want you to cut me out i want you to come to the rescue suppose you seen a wildcat about for to eat me what would you do go for it says i correct says george then go for this mrs de clinton the same how am i to do it i asks by force and awfulness or in some gentler and less lurid manner court her george says get her off my trail feed her take her out in boats hang around her and stick to her get her mashed on you if you can some women are pretty big fools who knows but what she might take a fancy to you had you ever thought i asks of repressing your fatal fascinations in her presence of squeezing a harsh note in the melody of your siren voice of veiling your beauty in other words of giving her the bounce yourself george sees no essence of sarcasm in my remark he twists his moustache and looks at the points of his shoes well simms he said you know how i am about the ladies i can t hurt none of their feelings i m by nature polite and esteemful of their intents and purposes this mrs de clinton don t appear to be the suitable sort for me besides i ain t a marrying man by all means all right said i i ll do the best i can in the case so i bought a new outfit of clothes and a book on etiquette and made a dead set for mrs de clinton she was a fine looking woman cheerful and gay at first i almost had to hobble her to keep her from loping around at george s heels but finally i got her so she seemed glad to go riding with me and sailing on the lake and she seemed real hurt on the mornings when i forgot to send her a bunch of flowers still i didn t like the way she looked at george sometimes out of the corner of her eye george was having a fine time now going with the whole bunch just as he pleased yes m continued bell she certainly was a fine looking woman at that time she s changed some since as you might have noticed at the supper table what i exclaimed i married mrs de clinton went on bell one evening while we were up at the lake when i told george about it he opened his mouth and i thought be was going to break our traditions and say something grateful but he swallowed it back all right says he playing with his dog i hope you won t have too much trouble myself i m not never going to marry that was three years ago said bell we came here to live for a year we got along medium fine and then everything changed for two years i ve been having something that rhymes first class with my name you heard the row upstairs this evening that was a merry welcome compared to the usual average she s tired of me and of this little town life and she rages all day like a panther in a cage i stood it until two weeks ago and then i had to send out the call i located george in sacramento he started the day he got my wire mrs bell came out of the house swiftly toward us some strong excitement or anxiety seemed to possess her but she smiled a faint hostess smile and tried to keep her voice calm the dew is falling she said and it s growing rather late wouldn t you gentlemen rather come into the house bell took some cigars from his pocket and answered it s most too fine a night to turn in yet i think mr ames and i will walk out along the road a mile or so and have another smoke i want to talk with him about some goods that i want to buy up the road or down the road asked mrs bell down said bell i thought she breathed a sigh of relief when we had gone a hundred yards and the house became concealed by trees bell guided me into the thick grove that lined the road and back through them toward the house again we stopped within twenty yards of the house concealed by the dark shadows i wondered at this maneuver and then i heard in the distance coming down the road beyond the house the regular hoofbeats of a team of horses bell held his watch in a ray of moonlight on time within a minute he said that s george s way the team slowed up as it drew near the house and stopped in a patch of black shadows we saw the figure of a woman carrying a heavy valise move swiftly from the other side of the house and hurry to the waiting vehicle then it rolled away briskly in the direction from which it had come i looked at bell inquiringly i suppose i certainly asked him no question she s running away with george said bell simply he s kept me posted about the progress of the scheme all along she ll get a divorce in six months and then george will marry her he never helps anybody halfway it s all arranged between them i began to wonder what friendship was after all when we went into the house bell began to talk easily on other subjects and i took his cue by and by the big chance to buy out the business in mountain city came back to my mind and i began to urge it upon him now that he was free it would be easier for him to make the move and he was sure of a splendid bargain bell was silent for some minutes but when i looked at him i fancied that he was thinking of something else that he was not considering the project why no mr ames he said after a while i can t make that deal i m awful thankful to you though for telling me about it but i ve got to stay here i can t go to mountain city why i asked missis bell he replied won t live in mountain city she hates the place and wouldn t go there i ve got to keep right on here in saltillo mrs bell i exclaimed too puzzled to conjecture what he meant i ought to explain said bell i know george and i know mrs bell he s impatient in his ways he can t stand things that fret him long like i can six months i give them six months of married life and there ll be another disunion mrs bell will come back to me there s no other place for her to go i ve got to stay here and wait at the end of six months i ll have to grab a satchel and catch the first train for george will be sending out the call a dinner at footnote see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers the story referred to in this skit appears in the trimmed lamp under the same title the badge of policeman o roon the adventures of an author with his own hero all that day in fact from the moment of his creation van sweller had conducted himself fairly well in my eyes of course i had had to make many concessions but in return he had been no less considerate once or twice we had had sharp brief contentions over certain points of behavior but prevailingly give and take had been our rule his morning toilet provoked our first tilt van sweller went about it confidently the usual thing i suppose old chap he said with a smile and a yawn i ring for a b and s and then i have my tub i splash a good deal in the water of course you are aware that there are two ways in which i can receive tommy carmichael when he looks in to have a chat about polo i can talk to him through the bathroom door or i can be picking at a grilled bone which my man has brought in which would you prefer i smiled with diabolic satisfaction at his coming discomfiture neither i said you will make your appearance on the scene when a gentleman should after you are fully dressed which indubitably private function shall take place behind closed doors and i will feel indebted to you if after you do appear your deportment and manners are such that it will not be necessary to inform the public in order to appease its apprehension that you have taken a bath van sweller slightly elevated his brows oh very well he said a trifle piqued i rather imagine it concerns you more than it does me cut the tub by all means if you think best but it has been the usual thing you know this was my victory but after van sweller emerged from his apartments in the beaujolie i was vanquished in a dozen small but well contested skirmishes i allowed him a cigar but routed him on the question of naming its brand but he worsted me when i objected to giving him a coat unmistakably english in its cut i allowed him to stroll down broadway and even permitted passers by god knows there s nowhere to pass but by to turn their heads and gaze with evident admiration at his erect figure i demeaned myself and as a barber gave him a smooth dark face with its keen frank eye and firm jaw later on he looked in at the club and saw freddy vavasour polo team captain dawdling over grilled bone no dear old boy began van sweller but in an instant i had seized him by the collar and dragged him aside with the scantiest courtesy for heaven s sake talk like a man i said sternly do you think it is manly to use those mushy and inane forms of address that man is neither dear nor old nor a boy to my surprise van sweller turned upon me a look of frank pleasure i am glad to hear you say that he said heartily i used those words because i have been forced to say them so often they really are contemptible thanks for correcting me dear old boy still i must admit that van sweller s conduct in the park that morning was almost without flaw the courage the dash the modesty the skill and fidelity that he displayed atoned for everything this is the way the story runs van sweller has been a gentleman member of the rugged riders the company that made a war with a foreign country famous among his comrades was lawrence o roon a man whom van sweller liked a strange thing and a hazardous one in fiction was that van sweller and o roon resembled each other mightily in face form and general appearance after the war van sweller pulled wires and o roon was made a mounted policeman now one night in new york there are commemorations and libations by old comrades and in the morning mounted policeman o roon unused to potent liquids another premise hazardous in fiction finds the earth bucking and bounding like a bronco with no stirrup into which he may insert foot and save his honor and his badge noblesse oblige surely so out along the driveways and bridle paths trots hudson van sweller in the uniform of his incapacitated comrade as like unto him as one french pea is unto a petit pois it is of course jolly larks for van sweller who has wealth and social position enough for him to masquerade safely even as a police commissioner doing his duty if he wished to do so but society not given to scanning the countenances of mounted policemen sees nothing unusual in the officer on the beat and then comes the runaway that is a fine scene the swaying victoria the impetuous daft horses plunging through the line of scattering vehicles the driver stupidly holding his broken reins and the ivory white face of amy ffolliott as she clings desperately with each slender hand fear has come and gone it has left her expression pensive and just a little pleading for life is not so bitter and then the clatter and swoop of mounted policeman van sweller oh it was but the story has not yet been printed when it is you shall learn bow he sent his bay like a bullet after the imperilled victoria a crichton a croesus and a centaur in one he hurls the invincible combination into the chase when the story is printed you will admire the breathless scene where van sweller checks the headlong team and then he looks into amy ffolliott s eyes and sees two things the possibilities of a happiness he has long sought and a nascent promise of it he is unknown to her but he stands in her sight illuminated by the hero s potent glory she his and he hers by all the golden fond unreasonable laws of love and light literature ay that is a rich moment and it will stir you to find van sweller in that fruitful nick of time thinking of his comrade o roon who is cursing his gyrating bed and incapable legs in an unsteady room in a west side hotel while van sweller holds his badge and his honor van sweller hears miss ffolliott s voice thrillingly asking the name of her preserver if hudson van sweller in policeman s uniform has saved the life of palpitating beauty in the park where is mounted policeman o roon in whose territory the deed is done how quickly by a word can the hero reveal himself thus discarding his masquerade of ineligibility and doubling the romance but there is his friend van sweller touches his cap it s nothing miss he says sturdily that s what we are paid for to do our duty and away he rides but the story does not end there as i have said van sweller carried off the park scene to my decided satisfaction even to me he was a hero when he foreswore for the sake of his friend the romantic promise of his adventure it was later in the day amongst the more exacting conventions that encompass the society hero when we had our liveliest disagreement at noon he went to o roon s room and found him far enough recovered to return to his post which he at once did at about six o clock in the afternoon van sweller fingered his watch and flashed at me a brief look full of such shrewd cunning that i suspected him at once time to dress for dinner old man he said with exaggerated carelessness very well i answered without giving him a clew to my suspicions i will go with you to your rooms and see that you do the thing properly i suppose that every author must be a valet to his own hero he affected cheerful acceptance of my somewhat officious proposal to accompany him i could see that he was annoyed by it and that fact fastened deeper in my mind the conviction that he was meditating some act of treachery when he had reached his apartments he said to me with a too patronizing air there are as you perhaps know quite a number of little distinguishing touches to be had out of the dressing process some writers rely almost wholly upon them i suppose that i am to ring for my man and that he is to enter noiselessly with an expressionless countenance he may enter i said with decision and only enter valets do not usually enter a room shouting college songs or with st vitus s dance in their faces so the contrary may be assumed without fatuous or gratuitous asseveration i must ask you to pardon me continued van sweller gracefully for annoying you with questions but some of your methods are a little new to me shall i don a full dress suit with an immaculate white tie or is there another tradition to be upset you will wear i replied evening dress such as a gentleman wears if it is full your tailor should be responsible for its bagginess and i will leave it to whatever erudition you are supposed to possess whether a white tie is rendered any whiter by being immaculate and i will leave it to the consciences of you and your man whether a tie that is not white and therefore not immaculate could possibly form any part of a gentleman s evening dress if not then the perfect tie is included and understood in the term dress and its expressed addition predicates either a redundancy of speech or the spectacle of a man wearing two ties at once with this mild but deserved rebuke i left van sweller in his dressing room and waited for him in his library about an hour later his valet came out and i heard him telephone for an electric cab then out came van sweller smiling but with that sly secretive design in his eye that was puzzling me i believe he said easily as he smoothed a glove that i will drop in at footnote see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers for dinner i sprang up angrily at his words this then was the paltry trick he had been scheming to play upon me i faced him with a look so grim that even his patrician poise was flustered you will never do so i exclaimed with my permission what kind of a return is this i continued hotly for the favors i have granted you i gave you a van to your name when i might have called you perkins or simpson i have humbled myself so far as to brag of your polo ponies your automobiles and the iron muscles that you acquired when you were stroke oar of your varsity eight or eleven whichever it is i created you for the hero of this story and i will not submit to having you queer it i have tried to make you a typical young new york gentleman of the highest social station and breeding you have no reason to complain of my treatment to you amy ffolliott the girl you are to win is a prize for any man to be thankful for and cannot be equalled for beauty provided the story is illustrated by the right artist i do not understand why you should try to spoil everything i had thought you were a gentleman what it is you are objecting to old man asked van sweller in a surprised tone to your dining at i answered see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers the pleasure would be yours no doubt but the responsibility would fall upon me you intend deliberately to make me out a tout for a restaurant where you dine tonight has not the slightest connection with the thread of our story you know very well that the plot requires that you be in front of the alhambra opera house at where you are to rescue miss ffolliott a second time as the fire engine crashes into her cab until that time your movements are immaterial to the reader why can t you dine out of sight somewhere as many a hero does instead of insisting upon an inapposite and vulgar exhibition of yourself my dear fellow said van sweller politely but with a stubborn tightening of his lips i m sorry it doesn t please you but there s no help for it even a character in a story has rights that an author cannot ignore the hero of a story of new york social life must dine at see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers at least once during its action must i echoed disdainfully why must who demands it the magazine editors answered van sweller giving me a glance of significant warning but why i persisted to please subscribers around kankakee ill said van sweller without hesitation how do you know these things i inquired with sudden suspicion you never came into existence until this morning you are only a character in fiction anyway i myself created you how is it possible for you to know anything pardon me for referring to it said van sweller with a sympathetic smile but i have been the hero of hundreds of stories of this kind i felt a slow flush creeping into my face i thought i stammered i was hoping that is oh well of course an absolutely original conception in fiction is impossible in these days metropolitan types continued van sweller kindly do not offer a hold for much originality i ve sauntered through every story in pretty much the same way now and then the women writers have made me cut some rather strange capers for a gentleman but the men generally pass me along from one to another without much change but never yet in any story have i failed to dine at see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers you will fail this time i said emphatically perhaps so admitted van sweller looking out of the window into the street below but if so it will be for the first time the authors all send me there i fancy that many of them would have liked to accompany me but for the little matter of the expense i say i will be touting for no restaurant i repeated loudly you are subject to my will and i declare that you shall not appear of record this evening until the time arrives for you to rescue miss ffolliott again if the reading public cannot conceive that you have dined during that interval at some one of the thousands of establishments provided for that purpose that do not receive literary advertisement it may suppose for aught i care that you have gone fasting thank you said van sweller rather coolly you are hardly courteous but take care it is at your own risk that you attempt to disregard a fundamental principle in metropolitan fiction one that is dear alike to author and reader i shall of course attend to my duty when it comes time to rescue your heroine but i warn you that it will be your loss if you fail to send me to night to dine at footnote see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers i will take the consequences if there are to be any i replied i am not yet come to be sandwich man for an eating house i walked over to a table where i had left my cane and gloves i heard the whirr of the alarm in the cab below and i turned quickly van sweller was gone i rushed down the stairs and out to the curb an empty hansom was just passing i hailed the driver excitedly see that auto cab halfway down the block i shouted follow it don t lose sight of it for an instant and i will give you two dollars if i only had been one of the characters in my story instead of myself i could easily have offered or or even but was all i felt justified in expending with fiction at its present rates the cab driver instead of lashing his animal into a foam proceeded at a deliberate trot that suggested a by the hour arrangement but i suspected van sweller s design and when we lost sight of his cab i ordered my driver to proceed at once to see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers i found van sweller at a table under a palm just glancing over the menu with a hopeful waiter hovering at his elbow come with me i said inexorably you will not give me the slip again under my eye you shall remain until van sweller countermanded the order for his dinner and arose to accompany me he could scarcely do less a fictitious character is but poorly equipped for resisting a hungry but live author who comes to drag him forth from a restaurant all he said was you were just in time but i think you are making a mistake you cannot afford to ignore the wishes of the great reading public i took van sweller to my own rooms to my room he had never seen anything like it before sit on that trunk i said to him while i observe whether the landlady is stalking us if she is not i will get things at a delicatessen store below and cook something for you in a pan over the gas jet it will not be so bad of course nothing of this will appear in the story jove old man said van sweller looking about him with interest this is a jolly little closet you live in where the devil do you sleep oh that pulls down and i say what is this under the corner of the carpet oh a frying pan i see clever idea fancy cooking over the gas what larks it will be think of anything you could eat i asked try a chop or what anything said van sweller enthusiastically except a grilled bone two weeks afterward the postman brought me a large fat envelope i opened it and took out something that i had seen before and this typewritten letter from a magazine that encourages society fiction your short story the badge of policeman o roon is herewith returned we are sorry that it has been unfavorably passed upon but it seems to lack in some of the essential requirements of our publication the story is splendidly constructed its style is strong and inimitable and its action and character drawing deserve the highest praise as a story per se it has merit beyond anything that we have read for some time but as we have said it fails to come up to some of the standards we have set could you not re write the story and inject into it the social atmosphere and return it to us for further consideration it is suggested to you that you have the hero van sweller drop in for luncheon or dinner once or twice at or at the see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers which will be in line with the changes desired

supreme and tender joy when kate scene that cortland never miss lore excuse me but wouldn t it be more grammatical to say when kate saw instead of seen mr penne the context will explain dictates when kate scene that cortland never forgot came tripping across the lawn it seemed to him the fairest sight that earth had ever offered to his gaze miss lore oh mr penne dictates kate had abandoned herself to the joy of her new found love so completely that no shadow of her former grief was cast upon it cortland with his arm firmly entwined about her waist knew nothing of her sighs miss lore goodness if he couldn t tell her size with his arm around mr penne frowning of her sighs and tears of the previous night miss lore oh mr penne dictates to cortland the chief charm of this girl was her look of innocence and unworldiness never had nun miss lore how about changing that to never had any mr penne emphatically never had nun in cloistered cell a face more sweet and pure miss lore oh mr penne dictates but now kate must hasten back to the house lest her absence be discovered after a fond farewell she turned and sped lightly away cortland s gaze followed her he watched her rise miss lore excuse me mr penne but how could he watch her eyes while her back was turned toward him mr penne with extreme politeness possibly you would gather my meaning more intelligently if you would wait for the conclusion of the sentence dictates watched her rise as gracefully as a fawn as she mounted the eastern terrace miss lore oh mr penne dictates and yet cortland s position was so far above that of this rustic maiden that he dreaded to consider the social upheaval that would ensue should he marry her in no uncertain tones the traditional voices of his caste and world cried out loudly to him to let her go what should follow miss lore looking up with a start i m sure i can t say mr penne unless with a giggle you would want to add gallegher mr penne coldly pardon me i was not seeking to impose upon you the task of a collaborator kindly consider the question a part of the text miss lore oh mr penne dictates on one side was love and kate on the other side his heritage of social position and family pride would love win love that the poets tell us will last forever perceives that miss lore looks fatigued and looks at his watch that s a good long stretch perhaps we d better knock off a bit miss lore does not reply mr penne i said miss lore we ve been at it quite a long time wouldn t you like to knock off for a while miss lore oh were you addressing me before i put what you said down i thought it belonged in the story it seemed to fit in all right oh no i m not tired mr penne very well then we will continue dictates in spite of these qualms and doubts cortland was a happy man that night at the club he silently toasted kate s bright eyes in a bumper of the rarest vintage afterward he set out for a stroll with as kate on miss lore excuse me mr penne for venturing a suggestion but don t you think you might state that in a less coarse manner mr penne astounded wh wh i m afraid i fail to understand you miss lore his condition why not say he was full or intoxicated it would sound much more elegant than the way you express it mr penne still darkly wandering will you kindly point out miss lore where i have intimated that cortland was full if you prefer that word miss lore calmly consulting her stenographic notes it is right here word for word reads afterward he set out for a stroll with a skate on mr penne with peculiar emphasis ah and now will you kindly take down the expurgated phrase dictates afterward he set out for a stroll with as kate on one occasion had fancifully told him her spirit leaning upon his arm miss lore oh mr penne dictates chapter thirty four heading what kate found in the garden that fragrant summer morning brought gracious tasks to all the bees were at the honeysuckle blossoms on the porch kate singing a little song was training the riotous branches of her favorite woodbine the sun himself had rows miss lore shall i say had risen mr penne very slowly and with desperate deliberation the sun himself had rows of blushing pinks and bollyhocks and hyacinths waiting that he might dry their dew drenched cups miss lore oh mr penne dictates the earliest trolley scattering the birds from its pathway like some marauding cat brought cortland over from oldport he had forgotten his fair miss lore hm wonder how he got the conductor to mr penne very loudly forgotten his fair and roseate visions of the night in the practical light of the sober morn miss lore oh mr penne dictates he greeted her with his usual smile and manner see the waves he cried pointing to the heaving waters of the sea ever wooing and returning to the rockbound shore ready to break kate said with miss lore my one evening he has his arm around her and the next morning he s ready to break her head just like a man mr penne with suspicious calmness there are times miss lore when a man becomes so far exasperated that even a woman but suppose we finish the sentence dictates ready to break kate said with the thrilling look of a soul awakened woman into foam and spray destroying themselves upon the shore they love so well miss lore oh mr penne dictates cortland in kate s presence heard faintly the voice of caution thirty years had not cooled his ardor it was in his power to bestow great gifts upon this girl he still retained the beliefs that he had at twenty to miss lore wearily i think that will be enough for the present miss lore wisely well if he had the twenty that he believed he had it might buy her a rather nice one mr penne faintly the last sentence was my own we will discontinue for the day miss lore miss lore shall i come again to morrow

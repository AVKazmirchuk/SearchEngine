i was frightened at first i m very very sorry i shot bill you don t know how ashamed i feel i wouldn t have done it for anything givens took the proffered hand he held it for a time while he allowed the generosity of his nature to overcome his grief at the loss of bill at last it was clear that he had forgiven her please don t speak of it any more miss josefa twas enough to frighten any young lady the way bill looked i ll explain it all right to the boys are you really sure you don t hate me josefa came closer to him impulsively her eyes were sweet oh sweet and pleading with gracious penitence i would hate anyone who would kill my kitten and how daring and kind of you to risk being shot when you tried to save him how very few men would have done that victory wrested from defeat vaudeville turned into drama bravo ripley givens it was now twilight of course miss josefa could not be allowed to ride on to the ranch house alone givens resaddled his pony in spite of that animal s reproachful glances and rode with her side by side they galloped across the smooth grass the princess and the man who was kind to animals the prairie odours of fruitful earth and delicate bloom were thick and sweet around them coyotes yelping over there on the hill no fear and yet josefa rode closer a little hand seemed to grope givens found it with his own the ponies kept an even gait the hands lingered together and the owner of one explained i never was frightened before but just think how terrible it would be to meet a really wild lion poor bill i m so glad you came with me o donnell was sitting on the ranch gallery hello rip he shouted that you he rode in with me said josefa i lost my way and was late much obliged called the cattle king stop over rip and ride to camp in the morning but givens would not he would push on to camp there was a bunch of steers to start off on the trail at daybreak he said good night and trotted away an hour later when the lights were out josefa in her night robe came to her door and called to the king in his own room across the brick paved hallway say pop you know that old mexican lion they call the gotch eared devil the one that killed gonzales mr

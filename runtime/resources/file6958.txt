part editor of everybody s kyntoekneeyough ranch november to mrs hall letter to mrs hall a friend back in north carolina this is one of the earliest letters found dear mrs hall as i have not heard from you since the shout you gave when you set out from the station on your way home i guess you have not received some seven or eight letters from me and hence your silence the mails are so unreliable that they may all have been lost if you don t get this you had better send to washington and get them to look over the dead letter office for the others i have nothing to tell you of any interest except that we all nearly froze to death last night thermometer away below degrees in the shade all night you ought by all means to come back to texas this winter you would love it more and more that same little breeze that you looked for so anxiously last summer is with us now as cold as callum bros suppose their soda water to be my sheep are doing finely they never were in better condition they give me very little trouble for i have never been able to see one of them yet i will proceed to give you all the news about this ranch dick has got his new house well under way the pet lamb is doing finely and i take the cake for cooking mutton steak and fine gravy the chickens are doing mighty well the garden produces magnificent prickly pears and grass onions are worth two for five cents and mr haynes has shot a mexican please send by express to this ranch cooks and washwomen blind or wooden legged ones perferred the climate has a tendency to make them walk off every two or three days which must be overcome ed brockman has quit the store and i think is going to work for lee among the cows wears a red sash and swears so fluently that he has been mistaken often for a member of the texas legislature if you see dr beall bow to him for me politely but distantly he refuses to waste a line upon me i suppose he is too much engaged in courting to write any letters give dr hall my profoundest regards i think about him invariably whenever he is occupying my thoughts influenced by the contents of the bugle there is an impression general at this ranch that you are president secretary and committee c of the various associations of fruit fairs sewing societies church fairs presbytery general assembly conference medical conventions and baby shows that go to make up the glory and renown of north carolina in general and while i heartily congratulate the aforesaid institutions on their having such a zealous and efficient officer i tremble lest their requirements leave you not time to favor me with a letter in reply to this and assure you that if you would so honor me i would highly appreciate the effort i would rather have a good long letter from you than many bugles in your letter be certain to refer as much as possible to the advantages of civilized life over the barbarous you might mention the theatres you see there the nice things you eat warm fires niggers to cook and bring in wood a special reference to nice beef steak would be advisable you know our being reminded of these luxuries makes us contented and happy when we hear of you people at home eating turkeys and mince pies and getting drunk christmas and having a fine time generally we become more and more reconciled to this country and would not leave it for anything i must close now as i must go and dress for the opera write soon yours very truly w s porter to dr w p beall dr beall of greensboro n c was one of young porter s dearest friends between them there was an almost regular correspondence during porter s first years in texas la salle county texas december dear doctor i send you a play a regular high art full orchestra gilt edged drama i send it to you because of old acquaintance and as a revival of old associations was i not ever ready in times gone by to generously furnish a spatula and other assistance when you did buy the succulent watermelon and was it not by my connivance and help that you did oft from the gentle oscar mayo skates entice but i digress i think that i have so concealed the identity of the characters introduced that no one will be able to place them as they all appear under fictitious names although i admit that many of the incidents and scenes were suggested by actual experiences of the author in your city you will of course introduce the play upon the stage if proper arrangements can be made i have not yet had an opportunity of ascertaining whether edwin booth john mccullough or henry irving can be secured however i will leave all such matters to your judgment and taste some few suggestions i will make with regard to the mounting of the piece which may be of value to you discrimination will be necessary in selecting a fit person to represent the character of bill slax the tramp the part is that of a youth of great beauty and noble manners temporarily under a cloud and is generally rather difficult to fill properly the other minor characters such as damfools citizens police customers countrymen c can be very easily supplied especially the first let it be announced in the patriot for several days that in front of benbow hall at a certain hour a man will walk a tight rope seventy feet from the ground who has never made the attempt before that the exhibition will be free and that the odds are to that the man will be killed a large crowd will gather then let the guilford grays charge one side the reidsville light infantry the other with fixed bayonets and a man with a hat commence taking up a collection in the rear by this means they can be readily driven into the hall and the door locked i have studied a long time about devising a plan for obtaining pay from the audience and have finally struck upon the only feasible one i think after the performance let some one come out on the stage and announce that james forbis will speak two hours the result easily explainable by philosophical and psychological reasons will be as follows the minds of the audience elated and inspired by the hope of immediate departure when confronted by such a terror inspiring and dismal prospect will collapse with the fearful reaction which will take place and for a space of time they will remain in a kind of comatose farewell vain world condition now as this is the time when the interest of the evening is at its highest pitch let the melodious strains of the orchestra steal forth as a committee appointed by the managers of lawyers druggists doctors and revenue officers go around and relieve the audience of the price of admission for each one where one person has no money let it be made up from another but on no account let the whole sum taken be more than the just amount at usual rates as i said before the characters in the play are purely imaginary and therefore not to be confounded with real persons but lest any one feeling some of the idiosyncrasies and characteristics apply too forcibly to his own high moral and irreproachable self should allow his warlike and combative spirits to arise you might as you go kind of casually like produce the impression that i rarely miss my aim with a colt s forty five but if that does not have the effect of quieting the splenetic individual and be still thirsts for bill slax s gore just inform him that if he comes out here he can t get any whiskey within two days journey of my present abode and water will have to be his only beverage while on the warpath this i am sure will avert the bloody and direful conflict accept my lasting regards and professions of respect ever yours bill slax to dr w p beall my dear doctor i wish you a happy c and all that sort of thing don t you know c c i send you a few little productions in the way of poetry c which of course were struck off in an idle moment some of the pictures are not good likenesses and so i have not labelled them which you may do as fast as you discover whom they represent as some of them resemble others more than themselves but the poems are good without exception and will compare favorably with baron alfred s latest on spring i have just come from a hunt in which i mortally wounded a wild hog and as my boots are full of thorns i can t write any longer than this paper will contain for it s all i ve got because i m too tired to write any more for the reason that i have no news to tell i see by the patriot that you are superintendent of public health and assure you that all such upward rise as you make like that will ever be witnessed with interest and pleasure by me c c give my regards to dr and mrs hall it would be uncomplimentary to your powers of perception as well as superfluous to say that i will now close and remain yours truly w s porter to dr w p beall la salle county texas february my dear doctor your appreciated epistle of the th received i was very glad to hear from you i hope to hear again if such irrelevant correspondence will not interfere with your duties as public health eradicator which i believe is the office you hold under county authority i supposed the very dramatic shakespearian comedy to be the last as i heard nothing from you previous before your letter and was about to write another of a more exciting character introducing several bloody single combats a dynamite explosion a ladies oyster supper for charitable purposes c also comprising some mysterious sub rosa transactions known only to myself and a select few new songs and dances and the greensboro poker club having picked up a few points myself relative to this latter amusement i feel competent to give a lucid glittering portrait of the scenes presented under its auspices but if the former drama has reached you safely i will refrain from burdening you any more with the labors of general stage manager c if long hair part of a sombrero mexican spurs c would make a fellow famous i already occupy a topmost niche in the temple frame if my wild untamed aspect had not been counteracted by my well known benevolent and amiable expression of countenance i would have been arrested long ago by the rangers on general suspicions of murder and horse stealing in fact i owe all my present means of lugubrious living to my desperate and bloodthirsty appearance combined with the confident and easy way in which i tackle a winchester rifle there is a gentleman who lives about fifteen miles from the ranch who for amusement and recreation and not altogether without an eye to the profit keeps a general merchandise store this gent for the first few months has been trying very earnestly to sell me a little paper which i would like much to have but am not anxious to purchase said paper is my account receipted occasionally he is absent and the welcome news coming to my ear i mount my fiery boss and gallop wildly up to the store enter with something of the sang froid grace abandon and recherche nonchalance with which charles yates ushers ladies and gentlemen to their seats in the opera house and nervously fingering my butcher knife fiercely demand goods and chattels of the clerk this plan always succeeds this is by way of explanation of this vast and unnecessary stationery of which this letter is composed i am always in too big a hurry to demur at kind and quality but when i get to town i will write you on small gilt edged paper that would suit even the fastidious and discriminating taste of a logan when i get to the city which will be shortly i will send you some account of this country and its inmates you are right i have almost forgotten what a regular old gum chewing ice cream destroying opera ticket vortex ivory clawing girl looks like last summer a very fair specimen of this kind ranged over about fort snell and i used to ride over twice a week on mail days and chew the end of my riding whip while she stood on the bridge and gathered up shells on the sea shore and wore the golden slippers but she has vamoosed and my ideas on the subject are again growing dim if you see anybody about to start to texas to live especially to this part if you will take your scalpyouler and sever the jugular vein cut the brachiopod artery and hamstring him after he knows what you have done for him he will rise and call you blessed this country is a silent but eloquent refutation of bob ingersoll s theory a man here gets prematurely insane melancholy and unreliable and finally dies of lead poisoning in his boots while in a good old land like greensboro a man can die as they do every day with all the benefits of the clergy w s porter austin texas april dear dave i take my pen in hand to let you know that i am well and hope these few lines will find you as well as can be expected i carried out your parting injunction of a floral nature with all the solemnity and sacredness that i would have bestowed upon a dying man s last request promptly at half past three i repaired to the robbers den commonly known as radams horticultural and vegetable emporium and secured the high priced offerings according to promise i asked if the bouquets were ready and the polite but piratical gentleman in charge pointed proudly to two objects on the counter reposing in a couple of vases and said they were i then told him i feared there was some mistake as no buttonhole bouquets had been ordered but he insisted on his former declaration and so i brought them away and sent them to their respective destinations i thought it a pity to spoil a good deck of cards by taking out only one so i bundled up the whole deck and inserted them in the bouquet but finally concluded it would not be right to violet joke my promise and i rose joke superior to such a mean trick and sent only one as directed i have a holiday to day as it is san jacinto day thermopylae had its messenger of defeat but the alamo had none mr president and fellow citizens those glorious heroes who fell for their country on the bloody field of san jacinto etc there is a bazaar to night in the representatives hall you people out in colorado don t know anything a bazaar is cedar and tacks and girls and raw cake and step ladders and austin grays

thing out west i hope we will see you soon yours as ever w s p austin texas april dear dave i received your letter in answer to mine which you never got till sometime after you had written i snatch a few moments from my arduous labors to reply the colorado has been on the biggest boom i have seen since in the pyrotechnical and not strictly grammatical language of the statesman the cruel devastating flood swept on a dreadful holocaust of swollen turbid waters surging and dashing in mad fury which have never been equalled in human history a pitiable sight was seen the morning after the flood six hundred men out of employment were seen standing on the banks of the river gazing at the rushing stream laden with debris of every description a wealthy new york banker who was present noticing the forlorn appearance of these men at once began to collect a subscription for them appealing in eloquent terms for help for these poor sufferers by the flood he collected one dollar and five horn buttons the dollar he had given himself he learned on inquiry that these men had not been at any employment in six years and all they had lost by the flood was a few fishing poles the banker put his dollar in his pocket and stepped up to the pearl saloon as you will see by this morning s paper there is to be a minstrel show next wednesday for benefit of austin grays i attended the rehearsal last night but am better this morning and the doctor thinks i will pull through with careful attention the jokes are mostly mildewed rockribbed and ancient as the sun i can give you no better idea of the tout ensemble and sine die of the affair than to state that scuddy is going to sing a song mrs harrell brought a lot of crystallized fruits from new orleans for you she wants to know if she shall send them around on bois d arc or keep them til you return answer write to your father he thinks you are leaving him out writing to everybody else first write we have the boss trick here now have sold about ten boxes of cigars betting on it in the store take four nickels and solder them together so the solder will not appear then cut out of three of them square hole like this illustration take about twelve other nickels and on top of them you lay a small die with the six up that will fit easily in the hole without being noticed you lay the four nickels over this and all presents the appearance of a stack of nickels you do all this privately so everybody will suppose it is nothing but a stack of five cent pieces you then lay another small die on top of the stack with the ace up you have a small tin cup shaped like this illustration made for the purpose you let everybody see the ace and then say you propose to turn the ace into a six you lay the tin cup carefully over the stack this way and feel around in your pocket for a pencil and not finding one the rest of this letter is lost austin texas may dear dave i received your two letters and have commenced two or three in reply but always failed to say what i wanted to and destroyed them all i heard from joe that you would probably remain in colorado i hope you will succeed in making a good thing out of it if you conclude to do so but would like to see you back again in austin if there is anything i can do for you here let me know town is fearfully dull except for the frequent raids of the servant girl annihilators who make things lively during the dead hours of the night if it were not for them items of interest would be very scarce as you may see by the statesman our serenading party has developed new and alarming modes of torture for our helpless and sleeping victims last thursday night we loaded up a small organ on a hack and with our other usual instruments made an assault upon the quiet air of midnight that made the atmosphere turn pale after going the rounds we were halted on the avenue by fritz hartkopf and ordered into his salon we went in carrying the organ etc a large crowd of bums immediately gathered prominent among which were to be seen percy james theodore hillyer randolph burmond charlie hicks and after partaking freely of lemonade we wended our way down and were duly halted and treated in the same manner by other hospitable gentlemen we were called in at several places while wit and champagne rhein wine etc flowed in a most joyous and hilarious manner it was one of the most recherche and per diem affairs ever known in the city nothing occurred to mar the pleasure of the hour except a trifling incident that might be construed as malapropos and post meridian by the hypercritical mr charles sims on attempting to introduce mr charles hicks and your humble servant to young ladies where we had been invited inside forgot our names and required to be informed on the subject before proceeding yours w s p austin texas december dear dave everything wept at your departure especially the clouds last night the clouds had a silver lining three dollars and a half s worth i fulfilled your engagement in grand tout ensemble style but there is a sad bon jour look about the thirty eight cents left in my vest pocket that would make a hired man weep all day long the heavens wept and the heavy sombre clouds went drifting about over head and the north wind howled in maniacal derision and the hack drivers danced on the pavements in wild fierce glee for they knew too well what the stormy day betokened the hack was to call for me at eight at five minutes to eight i went upstairs and dressed in my usual bijou and operatic style and rolled away to the opera emma sang finely i applauded at the wrong times and praised her rendering of the chromatic scale when she was performing on c flat andante pianissimo but otherwise the occasion passed off without anything to mar the joyousness of the hour everybody was there isidor moses and john ireland and fritz hartkopf and prof herzog and bill stacy and all the bong ton elight you will receive a draft to day through the first national bank of colorado for which you will please honor there is no news or there are no news either you like to tell lavaca street is very happy and quiet and enjoys life for jones was sat on by his uncle wash and feels humble and don t sing any more and the spirit of peace and repose broods over its halls martha rings the matin bell it seems to me before cock crow or ere the first faint streaks of dawn are limned in the eastern sky by the rosy fingers of aurora at noon the foul ogre cribbage stalks rampant and seven up for dim distant oysters that only the eye of faith can see the hour grows late the clock strikes another day has vanished gone into the dim recesses of the past leaving its record of misspent hours false hopes and disappointed expectations may a morrow dawn that will bring recompense and requital for the sorrows of the days gone by and a new order of things when there will be more starch in cuff and collar and less in handkerchiefs come with me out into the starlight night so calm so serene ye lights of heaven so high above earth so pure and majestic and mysterious looking down on the mad struggle of life here below is there no pity in your never closing eyes for us mortals on which you shine come with me on to the bridge ah see there far below the dark turbid stream rushing and whirling and eddying under the dark pillars with ghostly murmur and siren whisper what shall we find in your depths the stars do not reflect themselves in your waters they are too dark and troubled and swift what shall we find in your depths rest peace catfish who knows tis but a moment a leap a plunge and then oblivion or another world who can tell a man once dived into your depths and brought up a horse collar and a hoop skirt ah what do we know of the beyond we know that death comes and we return no more to our world of trouble and care but where do we go are there lands where no traveler has been a chaos perhaps where no human foot has trod perhaps bastrop perhaps new jersey who knows where do people go who are in mcdade do they go where they have to fare worse they cannot go where they have worse fare let us leave the river the night grows cold

of mine you have heard of a brook murmuring but you never knew a sewer sighed but we digress we will no longer pursue a side issue like this au reevoir i will see you later yours truly william shakespeare ingomar junius brutus calliope six handed euchre grover cleveland hill city quartette johnson an early parable in one of his early letters written from austin o henry wrote a long parable that was evidently to tell his correspondent some of the local gossip here it is once upon a time there was a maiden in a land not fax away a maiden of much beauty and rare accomplishments she was beloved by all on account of her goodness of heart and her many charms of disposition her father was a great lord rich and powerful and a mighty man and he loved his daughter with exceeding great love and he cared for her with jealous and loving watchfulness lest any harm should befall her or even the least discomfort should mar her happiness and cause any trouble in her smooth and peaceful life the cunningest masters were engaged to teach her from her youngest days she played upon the harpsichord the loveliest and sweetest music she wrought fancy work in divers strange and wonderful forms that might puzzle all beholders as to what manner of things they might be she sang and all listeners hearkened thereunto as to the voice of an angel she danced stately minuets with the gay knights as graceful as a queen and as light as the thistledown borne above the clover blossoms by the wind she could paint upon china rare and unknown flowers the like unto which man never saw in colors crimson and blue and yellow glorious to behold she conversed in unknown tongues whereof no man knew the meaning and sense and created wild admiration in all by the ease and grace with which she did play upon a new and strange instrument of wondrous sound and structure which she called a banjo she had gone into a strange land far away beyond the rivers that flowed through her father s dominion farther than one could see from the highest castle tower up into the land of ice and snow where wise men famous for learning and ancient lore had gathered together from many lands and countries the daughters of great men kings and powerful rulers railroad men bankers mighty men who wished to bring up their children to be wise and versed in all things old and new here the princess abode for many seasons and she sat at the feet of old wise men who could tell of the world s birth and the stars and read the meaning of the forms of the rocks that make the high mountains and knew the history of all created things that are and here she learned to speak strange tongues and studied the deep mysteries of the past the secrets of the ancients chaldic lore etruscan inscription hidden and mystic sciences and knew the names of all the flowers and things that grow in fields or wood even unto the tiniest weed by the brook in due time the princess came back to her father s castle the big bell boomed from the high tower the heavy iron gates were thrown open banners floated all along the battlemented walls and in the grand hall servants and retainers hurried to and fro bearing gold dishes and great bowls of flaming smoking punch while oxen were roasted whole and hogsheads of ale tapped on the common by the castle walls and thither hied them the villagers one and all to make merry at the corning of the dear princess again she will come back so wise and learned they said so far above us that she will not notice us as she did once but not so the princess with a red rose in her hair and dressed so plain and neat that she looked more like a farmer s daughter than a great king s came down among them from her father s side with nods of love and welcome on her lips and a smile upon her face and took them by the hands as in the old days and none among them so lowly or so poor but what received a kind word from the gracious princess and carried away in their hearts glad feelings that she was still the same noble and gracious lady she always was then night came and torches by thousands lit up the great forest and musicians played and bonfires glowed with sparks flying like myriads of stars among the gloomy trees in the great castle hall were gathered the brave knights and the fairest ladies in the kingdom the jolly old king surrounded by the wise men and officers of state moved about among his guests stately and courteous ravishing music burst forth from all sides and down the hall moved the fair princess in the mazy dance on the arm of a knight who gazed upon her face in rapt devotion and love who was he that dared to look thus upon the daughter of the king sovereign prince of the kingdom and the heiress of her father s wealth and lands he had no title no proud name to place beside a royal one beyond that of an honorable knight but who says that that is not a title that borne worthily makes a man the peer of any that wears a crown he had loved her long when a boy they had roamed together in the great forest about the castle and played among the fountains of the court like brother and sister the king saw them together often and smiled and went his way and said nothing the years went on and they were together as much as they could be the summer days when the court went forth into the forest mounted on prancing steeds to chase the stags with hounds all clad in green and gold with waving plumes and shining silver and ribbons of gay colors this knight was by the princess side to guide her through the pathless swamps where the hunt ranged and saw that no harm came to her and now that she had come back after years of absence he went to her with fear lest she should have changed for her old self and would not be to him as she was when they were boy and girl together but no there was the same old kindly welcome the same smiling greeting the warm pressure of the hand the glad look in the eyes as of yore the knight s heart beat wildly and a dim new awakened hope arose in him was she too far away after all he felt worthy of her and of any one in fact but he was without riches only a knight errant with his sword for his fortune and his great love his only title and he had always refrained from ever telling her anything of his love for his pride prevented him and you know a poor girl even though she be a princess cannot say to a man i am rich but let that be no bar between us i am yours and will let my wealth pass if you will give up your pride no princess can say this and the knight s pride would not let him say anything of the kind and so you see there was small chance of their ever coming to an understanding well the feasting and dancing went on and the knight and the princess danced and sang together and walked out where the moon was making a white wonder of the great fountain and wandered under the rows of great oaks but spoke no word of love though no mortal man knows what thoughts passed in their heads and she gave long accounts of the wonders she had seen in the far icy north in the great school of wise men and the knight talked of the wild and savage men he had seen in the far west where he had been in battles with the heathen in a wild and dreary land and she heard with pity his tales of suffering and trials in the desert among wild animals and fierce human kings and inside the castle the music died away and the lights grew dim and the villagers had long since gone to their homes and the knight and the princess still talked of old times and the moon climbed high in the eastern sky one day there came news from a country far to the west where lay the possessions of the knight the enemy had robbed him of his treasure driven away his cattle and he found it was best to hie him away and rescue his inheritance and goods he buckled on his sword and mounted his good war horse he rode to the postern gate of the castle to make his adieus to the princess when he told her he was going away to the wild western country to do battle with the heathen she grew pale and her eyes took on a look of such pain and fear that the knight s heart leaped and then sank in his bosom a his pride still kept him from speaking the words that might have made all well she bade him farewell in a low voice and tears even stood in leer eyes but what could she say or do the knight put spurs to his horse and dashed away over the hills without ever looking back and the princess stood looking over the gate at him till the last sight of his plume below the brow of the hill the knight was gone many suitors flocked about the princess mighty lords and barons of great wealth were at her feet and attended her every journey they came and offered themselves and their fortunes again and again but none of them found favor in her eyes will the princess listen to no one they began to say among themselves has she given her heart to some one who is not among us no one could say a great and mighty physician young and of wondrous power in his art telephoned to her every night if he might come down how his suit prospered no one could tell but he persevered with great and astonishing diligence a powerful baron who assisted in regulating the finances of the kingdom and who was a direct descendant of a great prince who was cast into a lion s den knelt at her feet a gay and lively lord who lived in a castle hung with ribbons and streamers and gay devices of all kinds with other nobles of like character prostrated themselves before her but she would listen to none of them the princess rode about in quiet ways in the cool evenings upon a gray palfrey alone and very quiet and she seemed to grow silent and thoughtful as time went on and no news came from the western wars and the knight came not back again to his daughter margaret toledo ohio oct dear margaret i got your very nice long letter a good many days ago it didn t come straight to me but went to a wrong address first i was very glad indeed to hear from you and very very sorry to learn of your getting your finger so badly hurt i don t think you were to blame at all as you couldn t know just how that villainous old hoss was going to bite i do hope that it will heal up nicely and leave your finger strong i am learning to play the mandolin and we must get you a guitar and we will learn a lot of duets together when i come home which will certainly not be later than next summer and maybe earlier i suppose you have started to school again some time ago i hope you like to go and don t have to study too hard when one grows up a thing they never regret is that they went to school long enough to learn all they could it makes everything easier for them and if they like books and study they can always content and amuse themselves that way even if other people are cross and tiresome and the world doesn t go to suit them you mustn t think that i ve forgotten somebody s birthday i couldn t find just the thing i wanted to send but i know where it can be had and it will reach you in a few days so when it comes you ll know it is for a birthday remembrance i think you write the prettiest hand of any little girl or big one either i ever knew the letters you make are as even and regular as printed ones the next time you write tell me how far you have to go to school and whether you go alone or not i am busy all the time writing for the papers and magazines all over the country so i don t have a chance to come home but i m going to try to come this winter if i don t i will by summer sure and then you ll have somebody to boss and make trot around with you write me a letter whenever you have some time to spare for i am always glad and anxious to hear from you be careful when you are on the streets not to feed shucks to strange dogs or pat snakes on the head or shake hands with cats you haven t been introduced to or stroke the noses of electric car horses hoping you are well and your finger is getting all right i am with much love as ever papa my dear margaret here it is summertime and the bees are blooming and the flowers are singing and the birds making honey and we haven t been fishing yet well there s only one more month till july and then we ll go and no mistake i thought you would write and tell me about the high water around pittsburg some time ago and whether it came up to where you live or not and i haven t heard a thing about easter and about the rabbit s eggs but i suppose you have learned by this time that eggs grow on egg plants and are not laid by rabbits i would like very much to hear from you oftener it has been more than a month now since you wrote write soon and tell me how you are and when school will be out for we want plenty of holidays in july so we can have a good time i am

ago i am told by the mistress of ceremonies that i am to furnish two bouquets one of lilies of the valley and one of pale pink roses get plenty of each say enough lilies to make a large bunch to be carried in the hand and say three or four dozen of the roses i note what you say about hard times and will take heed i m not going into any extravagances at all and i m going to pitch into hard work just as soon as i get the rice grains out of my ear i wired you to day ms mailed to day please rush one century by wire that will exhaust the reader check if it isn t too exhausted itself to come you of course will keep the check when it arrives i don t think they will fall down on it surely i wrote howland a pretty sharp letter and ordered him to send it at once care of everybody s when this story reaches you it will cut down the overdraft right smart but if the house is willing i d mighty well like to run it up to the limit again because cash is sure scarce and i ll have to have something like more to see me through the story i am sending is a new one i still have another partly written for you which i shall finish and turn in before i get back to new york and then we ll begin to clean up all debts just after the wedding we are going to hot spring n c only thirty five miles from asheville where there is a big winter resort hotel and stay there about a week or ten days then back to new york please look over the story and arrange for bringing me the when you come it will still keep me below the allowed limit and thereafter i will cut down instead of raising it just had a phone message from s l c saying how pleased she was with your letter to her i m right with you on the question of the home like system of having fun i think we ll all agree beautifully on that i ve had all the cheap bohemia that i want i can tell you none of the climbers and the cocktail crowd are going to bring their vaporings into my house it s for the clean merry life with your best friends in the game and a general concentration of energies and aims i am having a cedarwood club cut from the mountains with knots on it and i am going to stand in my hallway when i have one and edit with it the cards of all callers you and mrs will have latchkeys of course yes i think you d better stay at the hotel of course they d want you out at mrs c s but suppose we take mrs hall out there and you and i remain at the b p we ll be out at the cottage every day anyhow and it ll be scrumptious all round i m simply tickled to death that you all are coming the protoplasm is in heaven all s right with the world pippa passes yours as ever bill my dear col griffith friday keep your shirt on i found i had to re write the story when it came in i am sending you part of it just so you will have something tangible to remind you that you can t measure the water from the pierian spring in spoonfuls i ve got the story in much better form and i ll have the rest of it ready this evening i m sorry to have delayed it but it s best for both of us to have it a little late and a good deal better i ll send over the rest before closing time this afternoon or the first thing in the morning in its revised form i m much better pleased with it yours truly sydney porter to mr jennings mr al jennings of oklahoma city was an early friend of o henry s now in a prominent attorney mr jennings in his youth held up trains w n y sunday algie jennings esq the west dear bill glad you ve been sick too i m well again are you well as i had nothing to do i thought i would write you a letter and as i have nothing to say i will close how are ye bill how s old initiative and referendum when you cming back to manhattan you wouldn t know the old town now main street is building up and there is talk of an english firm putting up a new hotel i saw duffy a few days ago he looks kind of thoughtful as if he were trying to calculate how much he d have been ahead on gerald s board and clothes by now if you bad taken him with you mrs hale is up in maine for a weeks vacation say bill i m sending your ms back by mail to day i kept it a little longer after you sent for it because one of the mcclure phillips firm wanted to see it first everybody says it is full of good stuff but thinks it should be put in a more connected shape by some skilful writer who has been trained to that sort work it seems to me that you ought to do better with it out there than you could here if you can get somebody out there to publish it it ought to sell all right n y is a pretty cold proposition and it can t see as far as the oklahoma country when it is looking for sales how about trying indianapolis or chicago duffy told me about the other ms sent out by your friend abbott kind of a bum friendly trick wasn t it why don t you get arizona s hand done and send it on seems to me you could handle a short story all right my regards to mrs jennings and bro frank write some more still bill dear jennings n y may got your letter all right hope you ll follow it soon i d advise you not to build any high hopes on your book just consider that you re on a little pleasure trip and taking it along as a side line mighty few mss ever get to be books and mighty few books pay i have to go to pittsburg the first of next week to be gone about or days if you decide to come here any time after the latter part of next week i will be ready to meet you let me know in advance a day or two gallot is in grand rapids maybe he will run over for a day or two in haste and truly yours w s p it was hard to get o henry to take an interest in his books he was always eager to be at the undone work to be writing a new story instead of collecting old ones this letter came from north carolina it shows how much thought he gave always to titles land o the sky monday my dear colonel steger as i wired you to day i like man about town for a title but i am sending in a few others for you to look at and if any other suits you better i m agreeable here they are in preferred order the venturers transfers merry go rounds babylonica brickdust from babel babes in the jungle if none of these hit you right let me know and i ll get busy again but i think man about town is about the right thing it gives the city idea without using the old hackneyed words i am going to write you a letter in a day or so touchin on and appertainin to other matters and topics i am still improving and feeling pretty good colonel bingham has put in a new ash sifter and expects you to come down and see that it works all right all send regards to you you seem to have made quite a hit down here for a yankee salutations and good wishes yours s p this letter was found unfinished among his papers after his death his publishers had discussed many times his writing of a novel but the following letter constitutes the only record of his own opinions in the matter the date is surely or my dear mr steger my idea is to write the story of a man an individual not a type but a man who at the same time i want to represent a human nature type if such a person could exist the story will teach no lesson inculcate no moral advance no

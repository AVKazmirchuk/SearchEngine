room personal difficulties that arose on the ballroom floor were settled man to man with the weapons of nature under the supervision of the board no lady could say that she had witnessed a fight at a clover leaf hop in several years its gentlemen members guaranteed that so easily and smoothly had dempsey and the board done their preliminary work that many in the hall had not noticed the checking of the fascinating o sullivan s social triumph among these was maggie she looked about for her escort smoke up said rose cassidy wasn t you on demps donovan picked a scrap with your lizzie boy and they ve waltzed out to the slaughter room with him how s my hair look done up this way mag maggie laid a hand on the bosom of her cheesecloth waist gone to fight with dempsey she said breathlessly they ve got to be stopped dempsey donovan can t fight him why he ll he ll kill him ah what do you care said rosa don t some of em fight every hop but maggie was off darting her zig zag way through the maze of dancers she burst through the rear door into the dark hall and then threw her solid shoulder against the door of the room of single combat it gave way and in the instant that she entered her eye caught the scene the board standing about with open watches dempsey donovan in his shirt sleeves dancing light footed with the wary grace of the modern pugilist within easy reach of his adversary terry o sullivan standing with arms folded and a murderous look in his dark eyes and without slacking the speed of her entrance she leaped forward with a scream leaped in time to catch and hang upon the arm of o sullivan that was suddenly uplifted and to whisk from it the long bright stiletto that he had drawn from his bosom the knife fell and rang upon the floor cold steel drawn in the rooms of the give and take association such a thing had never happened before every one stood motionless for a minute andy geoghan kicked the stiletto with the toe of his shoe curiously like an antiquarian who has come upon some ancient weapon unknown to his learning and then o sullivan hissed something unintelligible between his teeth dempsey and the board exchanged looks and then dempsey looked at o sullivan without anger as one looks at a stray dog and nodded his head in the direction of the door the back stairs giuseppi he said briefly somebody pitch your hat down after you maggie walked up to dempsey donovan there was a brilliant spot of red in her cheeks down which slow tears were running but she looked him bravely in the eye i knew it dempsey she said as her eyes grew dull even in their tears i knew he was a guinea his name s tony spinelli i hurried in when they told me you and him was scrappin them guineas always carries knives but you don t understand dempsey i never had a fellow in my life i got tired of comin with anna and jimmy every night so i fixed it with him to call himself o sullivan and brought him along i knew there d be nothin doin for him if he came as a dago i guess i ll resign from the club now dempsey turned to andy geoghan chuck that cheese slicer out of the window he said and tell em inside that mr o sullivan has had a telephone message to go down to tammany hall and then he turned back to maggie say mag he said i ll see you home and how about next saturday night will you come to the hop with me if i call around for you it was remarkable how quickly maggie s eyes could change from dull to a shining brown with you dempsey she stammered say will a duck swim man about town there were two or three things that i wanted to know i do not care about a mystery so i began to inquire it took me two weeks to find out what women carry in dress suit cases and then i began to ask why a mattress is made in two pieces this serious query was at first received with suspicion because it sounded like a conundrum i was at last assured that its double form of construction was designed to make lighter the burden of woman who makes up beds i was so foolish as to persist begging to know why then they were not made in two equal pieces whereupon i was shunned the third draught that i craved from the fount of knowledge was enlightenment concerning the character known as a man about town he was more vague in my mind than a type should be we must have a concrete idea of anything even if it be an imaginary idea before we can comprehend it now i have a mental picture of john doe that is as clear as a steel engraving his eyes are weak blue he wears a brown vest and a shiny black serge coat he stands always in the sunshine chewing something and he keeps half shutting his pocket knife and opening it again with his thumb and if the man higher up is ever found take my assurance for it he will be a large pale man with blue wristlets showing

walls of his ante cave and wriggled his toes i know how you feel about it said binkley what else could she do there were her four sisters and her mother and old man carr you remember how he put all the money he had into dirigible balloons well everything was coming down and nothing going up with em as you might say well i know edith as well as you do although i married her i was worth a million then but i ve run it up since to between five and six it wasn t me she wanted as much as well it was about like this she had that bunch on her hands and they had to be taken care of edith married me two months after you did the ground squirrel act i thought she liked me too at the time and now inquired the recluse we re better friends than ever now she got a divorce from me two years ago just incompatibility i didn t put in any defence well well well hamp this is certainly a funny dugout you ve built here but you always were a hero of fiction seems like you d have been the very one to strike edith s fancy maybe you did but it s the bank roll that catches em my boy your caves and whiskers won t do it honestly hamp don t you think you ve been a darned fool the hermit smiled behind his tangled beard he was and always had been so superior to the crude and mercenary binkley that even his vulgarities could not anger him moreover his studies and meditations in his retreat had raised him far above the little vanities of the world his little mountain side had been almost an olympus over the edge of which he saw smiling the bolts hurled in the valleys of man below had his ten years of renunciation of thought of devotion to an ideal of living scorn of a sordid world been in vain up from the world had come to him the youngest and beautifulest fairer than edith one and three seventh times lovelier than the seven years served rachel so the hermit smiled in his beard when binkley had relieved the hermitage from the blot of his presence and the first faint star showed above the pines the hermit got the can of baking powder from his cupboard he still smiled behind his beard there was a slight rustle in the doorway there stood edith carr with all the added beauty and stateliness and noble bearing that ten years had brought her she was never one to chatter she looked at the hermit with her large thinking dark eyes the hermit stood still surprised into a pose as motionless as her own only his subconscious sense of the fitness of things caused him to turn the baking powder can slowly in his hands until its red label was hidden against his bosom i am stopping at the inn said edith in low but clear tones i heard of you there i told myself that i must see you i want to ask your forgiveness i sold my happiness for money there were others to be provided for but that does not excuse me i just wanted to see you and ask your forgiveness you have lived here ten years they tell me cherishing my memory i was blind hampton i could not see then that all the money in the world cannot weigh in the scales against a faithful heart if but it is too late now of course her assertion was a question clothed as best it could be in a loving woman s pride but through the thin disguise the hermit saw easily that his lady had come back to him if he chose he had won a golden crown if it pleased him to take it the reward of his decade of faithfulness was ready for his hand if he desired to stretch it forth for the space of one minute the old enchantment shone upon him with a reflected radiance and then by turns he felt the manly sensations of indignation at having been discarded and of repugnance at having been as it were sought again and last of all how strange that it should have come at last the pale blue vision of the beautifulest of the trenholme sisters illuminated his mind s eye and left him without a waver it is too late he said in deep tones pressing the baking powder can against his heart once she turned after she had gone slowly twenty yards down the path the hermit had begun to twist the lid off his can but he hid it again under his sacking robe he could see her great eyes shining sadly through the twilight but he stood inflexible in the doorway of his shack and made no sign just as the moon rose on thursday evening the hermit was seized by the world madness up from the inn fainter than the horns of elf land came now and then a few bars of music played by the casino band the hudson was broadened by the night into an illimitable sea those lights dimly seen on its opposite shore were not beacons for prosaic trolley lines but low set stars millions of miles away the waters in front of the inn were gay with fireflies or were they motor boats smelling of gasoline and oil once the hermit had known these things and had sported with amaryllis in the shade of the red and white striped awnings but for ten years he had turned a heedless ear to these far off echoes of a frivolous world but to night there was something wrong the casino band was playing a waltz a waltz what a fool he had been to tear deliberately ten years of his life from the calendar

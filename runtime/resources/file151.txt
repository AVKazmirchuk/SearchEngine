an ecstatic scream of joy and then alas a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat for there lay the combs the set of combs side and back that della had worshipped long in a broadway window beautiful combs pure tortoise shell with jewelled rims just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair they were expensive combs she knew and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession and now they were hers but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone but she hugged them to her bosom and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say my hair grows so fast jim and them della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried oh oh jim had not yet seen his beautiful present she held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm the dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit isn t it a dandy jim i hunted all over town to find it you ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now give me your watch i want to see how it looks on it instead of obeying jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled dell said he let s put our christmas presents away and keep em a while they re too nice to use just at present i sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs and now suppose you put the chops on the magi as you know were wise men wonderfully wise men who brought gifts to the babe in the manger they invented the art of giving christmas presents being wise their gifts were no doubt wise ones possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication and here i have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house but in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest of all who give and receive gifts such as they are wisest everywhere they are wisest they are the magi a cosmopolite in a cafe at midnight the cafe was crowded by some chance the little table at which i sat had escaped the eye of incomers and two vacant chairs at it extended their arms with venal hospitality to the influx of patrons and then a cosmopolite sat in one of them and i was glad for i held a theory that since adam no true citizen of the world has existed we hear of them and we see foreign labels on much luggage but we find travellers instead of cosmopolites i invoke your consideration of the scene the marble topped tables the range of leather upholstered wall seats the gay company the ladies dressed in demi state toilets speaking in an exquisite visible chorus of taste economy opulence or art the sedulous and largess loving garcons the music wisely catering to all with its raids upon the composers the melange of talk and laughter and if you will the wurzburger in the tall glass cones that bend to your lips as a ripe cherry sways on its branch to the beak of a robber jay i was told by a sculptor from mauch chunk that the scene was truly parisian my cosmopolite was named e rushmore coglan and he will be heard from next summer at coney island he is to establish a new attraction there he informed me offering kingly diversion and then his conversation rang along parallels of latitude and longitude he took the great round world in his hand so to speak familiarly contemptuously and it seemed no larger than the seed of a maraschino cherry in a table d hote grape fruit he spoke disrespectfully of the equator he skipped from continent to continent he derided the zones he mopped up the high seas with his napkin with a wave of his hand he would speak of a certain bazaar in hyderabad whiff he would have you on skis in lapland zip now you rode the breakers with the kanakas at kealaikahiki presto he dragged you through an arkansas post oak swamp let you dry for a moment on the alkali plains of his idaho ranch then whirled you into the society of viennese archdukes anon he would be telling you of a cold he acquired in a chicago lake breeze and how old escamila cured it in buenos ayres with a hot infusion of the chuchula weed you would have addressed a letter to e rushmore coglan esq the earth solar system the universe and have mailed it feeling confident that it would be delivered to him i was sure that i had found at last the one true cosmopolite since adam and i listened to his worldwide discourse fearful lest i should discover in it the local note of the mere globe trotter but his opinions never fluttered or drooped he was as impartial to cities countries and continents as the winds or gravitation and as e rushmore coglan prattled of this little planet i thought with glee of a great almost cosmopolite who wrote for the whole world and dedicated himself to bombay in a poem he has to say that there is pride and rivalry between the cities of the earth and that the men that breed from them they traffic up and down but cling to their cities hem as a child to the mother s gown and whenever they walk by roaring streets unknown they remember their native city

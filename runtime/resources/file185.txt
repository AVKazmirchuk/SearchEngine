beg of you to accept my advice or aid do not belie the intelligence i see in your face by judging from my appearance of my ability to defeat your troubles the young man glanced at the clock again and

the lights in many rooms shone dimly through them ten minutes to nine exclaimed the young man with an impatient gesture of despair he turned his back upon the house and took a rapid step or two in a contrary direction remain commanded prince michael in so potent a voice that the disturbed one wheeled around with a somewhat chagrined laugh i ll give her the ten minutes and then i m off he muttered and then aloud to the prince i ll join you in confounding all clocks my friend and throw in women too sit down said the prince calmly i do not accept your addition women are the natural enemies of clocks and therefore the allies of those who would seek liberation from these monsters that measure our follies and limit our pleasures if you will so far confide in me i would ask you to relate to me

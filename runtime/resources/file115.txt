winchester rifles so so says i to myself somebody s gettin a twist on the neutrality laws somebody s aidin with munitions of war i wonder where the popguns are goin i heard somebody cough and i turned around there stood a little round fat man with a brown face and white clothes a first class looking little man with a four karat diamond on his finger and his eye full of interrogations and respects i judged he was a kind of foreigner may be from russia or japan or the archipelagoes hist says the round man full of concealments and confidences will the senor respect the discoveryments he has made

bein a clancy in two minutes me and the foreigner man were seated at a table in the cabin of the steamer with a bottle between us i could hear the heavy boxes bein dumped into the hold i judged that

practically instigate secession i had heard a good deal about these revolutions in them tropical localities and i begun to want a hand in it you goin to stir things up in your country ain t you

thousands strong good mans to aid the general de vega that he shall to his country bring those success and glory it is hard oh so hard to find good mans to help in the work monseer says i leanin over the table and graspin his hand i don t know where your country is but me heart bleeds for it the heart of a clancy was never deaf to the sight of an oppressed people the family is filibusterers by birth and foreigners by trade if you can use james clancy s arms and his blood in denuding your shores of the tyrant s yoke they re yours to command general de vega was overcome with joy to confiscate my condolence of his conspiracies and predicaments he tried to embrace me across the table but his fatness and the wine that had been in the bottles prevented thus was i welcomed into the ranks of filibustery then the general man told me his country had the name of guatemala and was the greatest nation laved by any ocean whatever anywhere he looked at me with tears in his eyes and from time to time he would emit the remark ah big strong brave mans that is what my country need general de vega as was the name by which he denounced himself brought out a document for me to sign which i did

together i d need when i came aboard i showed the general with pride the outfit twas a fine chinchilla overcoat arctic overshoes fur cap and earmuffs with elegant fleece lined gloves and woollen muffler carrambos says the little general what clothes are these that shall go to the tropic and then the little spalpeen laughs and he calls the captain and the captain calls the purser and they pipe up the chief engineer and the whole gang leans against the cabin and laughs at clancy s wardrobe for guatemala i reflects a bit serious and asks the general again to denominate the terms by which his country is called he tells me and i see then that twas the t other one kamchatka i had in mind since then i ve had difficulty in separatin the two nations in name climate and geographic disposition i paid my passage

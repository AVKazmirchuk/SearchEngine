i will hold the fort and the dinner check long enough for you to get your hat and be off i thank you for an evening out of the ordinary mr ives and wish we might have others if my memory is not at fault said ives laughing the nearest police station is in macdougal street i have enjoyed the dinner too let me assure you forster crooked his finger for the waiter victor with a locomotive effort that seemed to owe more to pneumatics than to pedestrianism glided to the table and laid the card face downward by the loser s cup forster took it up and added the figures with deliberate care ives leaned back comfortably in his chair escuse me said forster but i though you were going to ring grimes about that theatre party for thursday night had you forgotten about it oh said ives settling himself more comfortably i can do that later on get me a glass of water waiter want to be in at the death do you asked forster i hope you don t object said ives pleadingly never in my life have i seen a gentleman arrested in a public restaurant for swindling it out of a dinner all right said forster calmly you are entitled to see a christian die in the arena as your pousse caf victor came with the glass of water and remained with the disengaged air of an inexorable collector forster hesitated for fifteen seconds and then took a pencil from his pocket and scribbled his name on the dinner check the waiter bowed and took it away the fact is said forster with a little embarrassed laugh i doubt whether i m what they call a game sport which means the same as a soldier of fortune i ll have to make a confession i ve been dining at this hotel two or three times a week for more than a year i always sign my checks and then with a note of appreciation in his voice it was first rate of you to stay to see me through with it when you knew i had no money and that you might be scooped in too i guess i ll confess too said ives with a grin i own the hotel i don t run it of course but i always keep a suite on the third floor for my use when i happen to stray into town he called a waiter and said i s mr gilmore still behind the desk all right tell him that mr ives is here and ask him to have my rooms made ready and aired another venture cut short by the inevitable said forster is there a conundrum without an answer in the next number but let s hold to our subject just for a minute or two if you will it isn t often that i meet a man who understands the flaws i pick in existence i am engaged to be married a month from to day i reserve comment said ives right i am going to add to the assertion i am devotedly fond of the lady but i can t decide whether to show up at the church or make a sneak for alaska it s the same idea you know that we were discussing it does for a fellow as far as possibilities are concerned everybody knows the routine you get a kiss flavored with ceylon tea after breakfast you go to the office you come back home and dress for dinner theatre twice a week bills moping around most evenings trying to make conversation a little quarrel occasionally maybe sometimes a big one and a separation or else a settling down into a middle aged contentment which is worst of all i know said ives nodding wisely it s the dead certainty of the thing went on forster that keeps me in doubt there ll nevermore be anything around the corner nothing after the little church said ives i know understand said forster that i am in no doubt as to my feelings toward the lady i may say that i love her truly and deeply but there is something in the current that runs through my veins that cries out against any form of the calculable i do not know what i want but i know that i want it i m talking like an idiot i suppose but i m sure of what i mean i understand you said ives with a slow smile well i think i will be going up to my rooms now if you would dine with me here one evening soon mr forster i d be glad thursday suggested forster at seven if it s convenient answered ives seven goes assented forster at halft past eight ives got into a cab and was driven to a number in one of the correct west seventies his card admitted him to the reception room of an old fashioned house into which the spirits of fortune chance and adventure had never dared to enter on the walls were the whistler etchings the steel engravings by oh what s his name the still life paintings of the grapes and garden truck with the watermelon seeds spilled on the table as natural as life and the greuze head it was a household there was even brass andirons on a table was an album half morocco with oxidized silver protections on the corners of the lids a clock on the mantel ticked loudly with a warning click at five minutes to nine ives looked at it curiously remembering a time piece in his grandmother s home that gave such a warning and then down the stairs and into the room came mary marsden she was twenty four and i leave her to your imagination but i must say this much youth and health and simplicity and courage and greenish violet eyes

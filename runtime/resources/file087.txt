roll with a sounding thwack the loungers on the beach about a third of the population of the town laughed and applauded delightedly every week they expected to see that roll of papers delivered and received in that same manner and they were never disappointed innovations did not flourish in coralio the consul re hoisted his umbrella and walked back to the consulate this home of a great nation s representative was a wooden structure of two rooms with a native built gallery of poles bamboo and nipa palm running on three sides of it one room was the official apartment furnished chastely with a flat top desk a hammock and three uncomfortable cane seated chairs engravings of the first and latest president of the country represented hung against the wall the other room was the consul s living apartment it was eleven o clock when he returned from the beach and therefore breakfast time chanca the carib woman who cooked for him was just serving the meal on the side of the gallery facing the sea a spot famous as the coolest in coralio the breakfast consisted of shark s fin soup stew of land crabs breadfruit a boiled iguana steak aquacates a freshly cut pineapple claret and coffee geddie took his seat and unrolled with luxurious laziness his bundle of newspapers here in coralio for two days or longer he would read the goings on in the world very much as we of the world read those whimsical contributions to inexact science that assume to portray the doings of the martians after he had finished with the papers they would be sent on the rounds of the other english speaking residents of the town the paper that came first to his hand was one of those bulky mattresses of printed stuff upon which the readers of certain new york journals are supposed to take their sabbath literary nap opening this the consul rested it upon the table supporting its weight with the aid of the back of a chair then he partook of his meal deliberately turning the leaves from time to time and glancing half idly at the contents presently he was struck by something familiar to him in a picture a half page badly printed reproduction of a photograph of a vessel languidly interested he leaned for a nearer scrutiny and a view of the florid headlines of the column next to the picture yes he was not mistaken the engraving was of the eight hundred ton yacht idalia belonging to that prince of good fellows midas of the money market and society s pink of perfection j ward tolliver slowly sipping his black coffee geddie read the column of print following a listed statement of mr tolliver s real estate and bonds came a description of the yacht s furnishings and then the grain of news no bigger than a mustard seed mr tolliver with a party of favored guests would sail the next day on a six weeks cruise along the central american and south american coasts and among the bahama islands among the guests were mrs cumberland payne and miss ida payne of norfolk the writer with the fatuous presumption that was demanded of him by his readers had concocted a romance suited to their palates he bracketed the names of miss payne and mr tolliver until he had well nigh read the marriage ceremony over them he played coyly and insinuatingly upon the strings of on dit and madame rumor and a little bird and no one would be surprised and ended with congratulations geddie having finished his breakfast took his papers to the edge of the gallery and sat there in his favorite steamer chair with his feet on the bamboo railing he lighted a cigar and looked out upon the sea he felt a glow of satisfaction at finding he was so little disturbed by what he had read he told himself that he had conquered the distress that had sent him a voluntary exile to this far land of the lotus he could never forget ida of course but there was no longer any pain in thinking about her when they had had that misunderstanding and quarrel he had impulsively sought this consulship with the desire to retaliate upon her by detaching himself from her world and presence he had succeeded thoroughly in that during the twelve months of his life in coralio no word had passed between them though he had sometimes heard of her through the dilatory correspondence with the few friends to whom he still wrote still he could not repress a little thrill of satisfaction at knowing that she had not yet married tolliver or any one else but evidently tolliver had not yet abandoned hope well it made no difference to him now he had eaten of the lotus he was happy and content in this land of perpetual afternoon those old days of life in the states seemed like an irritating dream he hoped ida would be as happy as he was the climate as balmy as that of distant avalon the fetterless idyllic round of enchanted days the life among this indolent romantic people a life full of music flowers and low laughter the influence of the imminent sea and mountains and the many shapes of love and magic and beauty that bloomed in the white tropic nights with all he was more than content also there was paula brannigan geddie intended to marry paula if of course she would consent but he felt rather sure that she would do that somehow he kept postponing his proposal several times he had been quite near to it but a mysterious something always held him back perhaps it was only the unconscious instinctive conviction that the act would sever the last tie that bound him to his old world he could be very happy with paula few of the native girls could be compared

oh canary bird seed exclaimed annette ain t it a corkin situation you a heiress and fallin in love with him on sight he s a sweet boy too and above his business but he ain t susceptible like the common run of grocer s assistants he never pays no attention to me he will to me said celia riches began annette unsheathing the not unjustifiable feminine sting oh you re not so beautiful said celia with her wide disarming smile neither am i but he sha n t know that there s any money mixed up with my looks such as they are that s fair now i want you to lend me one of your caps and an apron annette oh marshmallows cried annette i see ain t it lovely it s just like lurline the left handed or a buttonhole maker s wrongs i ll bet he ll turn out to be a count there was a long hallway or passageway as they call it in the land of the colonels with one side latticed running along the rear of the house the grocer s young man went through this to deliver his goods one morning he passed a girl in there with shining eyes sallow complexion and wide smiling mouth wearing a maid s cap and apron but as he was cumbered with a basket of early drumhead lettuce and trophy tomatoes and three bunches of asparagus and six bottles of the most expensive queen olives he saw no more than that she was one of the maids but on his way out he came up behind her and she was whistling fisher s

contain a description of certain stages of its progress without intruding upon the province of the x ray or of park policemen a day came when thomas mcleod and celia lingered at the end of the latticed passage sixteen a week isn t much said thomas letting his cap rest on his shoulder blades celia looked through the lattice work and whistled a dead march shopping with aunt henrietta the day before she had paid that much for a dozen handkerchiefs maybe i ll get a raise next month said thomas i ll be around to morrow at the same time with a bag of flour and the laundry soap all right said celia annette s married cousin pays only a month for a flat in the bronx never for a moment did she count on the spraggins money she knew aunt henrietta s invincible pride of caste and pa s mightiness

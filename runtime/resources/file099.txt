and presented him to the handful of americans and the smaller number of french and germans who made up the foreign contingent and then of course he had to be more formally introduced to the native officials and have his credentials transmitted through an interpreter there was something about the young southerner that the sophisticated keogh liked his manner was simple almost to boyishness but he possessed the cool carelessness of a man of far greater age and experience neither uniforms nor titles red tape nor foreign languages mountains nor sea weighed upon his spirits he was heir to all ages an atwood of dalesburg and you might know every thought conceived to his bosom geddie came down to the consulate to explain the duties and workings of the office he and keogh tried to interest the new consul in their description of the work that his government expected him to perform it s all right said johnnie from the hammock that he had set up as the official reclining place if anything turns up that has to be done i ll let you fellows do it you can t expect a democrat to work during his first term of holding office you might look over these headings suggested geddie of the different lines of exports you will have to keep account of the fruit is classified and there are the valuable woods coffee rubber that last account sounds all right interrupted mr atwood sounds as if it could be stretched i want to buy a new flag a monkey a guitar and a barrel of pineapples will the rubber account stretch over em that s merely statistics said geddie smiling the expense account is what you want it is supposed to have a slight elasticity the stationery items are sometimes carelessly audited by the state department we re wasting our time said keogh this man was born to hold office he penetrates to the root of the art at one step of his eagle eye the true genius of government shows its hand in every word of his speech i didn t take this job with any intention of working explained johnny lazily i wanted to go somewhere in the world where they didn t talk about farms there are none here are there not the kind you are acquainted with answered the ex consul there is no such art here as agriculture there never was a plow or a reaper within the boundaries of anchuria this is the country for me murmured the consul and immediately he fell asleep the cheerful tintypist pursued his intimacy with johnny in spite of open charges that he did so to obtain a preemption on a seat in that coveted spot the rear gallery of the consulate but whether his designs were selfish or purely friendly keogh achieved that desirable privilege few were the nights on which the two could not be found reposing there in the sea breeze with their heels on the railing and the cigars and brandy conveniently near one evening they sat thus mainly silent for their talk had dwindled before the stilling influence of an unusual night there was a great full moon and the sea mother of pearl almost every sound was hushed for the air was but faintly stirring and the town lay panting waiting for the night to cool offshore lay the fruit steamer andador of the vesuvius line full laden and scheduled to sail at six in the morning there were no loiterers on the beach so bright was the moonlight that the two men could see the small pebbles shining on the beach where the gentle surf wetted them then down the coast tacking close to shore slowly swam a little sloop white winged like some snowy sea fowl its course lay within twenty points of the wind s eye so it veered in and out again in long slow strokes like the movements of a graceful skater again the tactics of its crew brought it close in shore this time nearly opposite the consulate and then there blew from the sloop clear and surprising notes as if from a horn of elfland a fairy bugle it might have been sweet and silvery and unexpected playing with spirit the familiar air of home sweet home it was a scene set for the land of the lotus the authority of the sea and the tropics the mystery that attends unknown sails and the prestige of drifting music on moonlit waters gave it an anodynous charm johnny atwood felt it and thought of dalesburg but as soon as keogh s mind had arrived at a theory concerning the peripatetic solo he sprang to the railing and his ear rending yawp fractured the silence of coralio like a cannon shot mel lin ger a hoy the sloop was now on its outward tack but from it came a clear answering hail good bye billy go ing home bye the andador was the sloop s destination no doubt some passenger with a sailing permit from some up the coast point had come down in this sloop to catch the regular fruit steamer on its return trip like a coquettish pigeon the little boat tacked on its eccentric way until at last its white sail was lost to sight against the larger bulk of the fruiter s side that s old h p mellinger explained keogh dropping back into his chair he s going back to new york he was a private secretary of the late hot foot president of this grocery and fruit stand that they call a country his job s over now and i guess old mellinger is glad why does he disappear to music like zo zo the magic queen asked johnny just to show em that he doesn t care that noise you heard is a phonograph said keogh i sold him that mellinger had a graft in this country that was

know what i mean by any such sandblasted nonsense well old jalap and jerusalem oakseed says i i m no regular practitioner but i ll show you my authority anyway they fetched my coat and i gets out the handbook look on page says i at the remedy for suffocation by smoke or gas flaxseed in the outer corner of the eye it says i don t know whether it works as a smoke consumer or whether it hikes the compound gastro hippopotamus nerve into action but herkimer says it and he was called to the case first if you want to make it a consultation there s no objection old doc takes the book and looks at it by means of his specs and a fireman s lantern well mr pratt says he you evidently got on the wrong line in reading your diagnosis the recipe for suffocation says get the patient into fresh air as quickly as possible and place in a reclining position the flaxseed remedy is for dust and cinders in the eye on the line above but after all see here interrupts mrs sampson i reckon i ve got something to say in this consultation that flaxseed done me more good than anything i ever tried and then she raises up her head and lays it back on my arm again and says put some in the other eye sandy dear and so if you was to stop off at rosa to morrow or any other day you d see a fine new yellow house with mrs pratt that was mrs sampson embellishing and adorning it and if you was to step inside you d see on the marble top centre table in the parlour herkimer s handbook of indispensable information all rebound in red morocco and ready to be consulted on any subject pertaining to human happiness and wisdom the pimienta pancakes while we were rounding up a bunch of the triangle o cattle in the frio bottoms a projecting branch of a dead mesquite caught my wooden stirrup and gave my ankle a wrench that laid me up in camp for a week on the third day of my compulsory idleness i crawled out near the grub wagon and reclined helpless under the conversational fire of judson odom the camp cook jud was a monologist by nature whom destiny with customary blundering had set in a profession wherein he was bereaved for the greater portion of his time of an audience therefore i was manna in the desert of jud s obmutescence betimes i was stirred by invalid longings for something to eat that did not come under the caption of grub i had visions of the maternal pantry deep as first love and wild with all regret and then i asked jud can you make pancakes jud laid down his six shooter with which he was preparing to pound an antelope steak and stood over me in what i felt to be a menacing attitude he further endorsed my impression that his pose was resentful by fixing upon me with his light blue eyes a look of cold suspicion say you he said with candid though not excessive choler did you mean that straight or was you trying to throw the gaff into me some of the boys been telling you about me and that pancake racket no jud i said sincerely i meant it it seems to me i d swap my pony and saddle for a stack of buttered brown pancakes with some first crop open kettle new orleans sweetening was there a story about pancakes jud was mollified at once when he saw that i had not been dealing in allusions he brought some mysterious bags and tin boxes from the grub wagon and set them in the shade of the hackberry where i lay reclined i watched him as he began to arrange them leisurely and untie their many strings no not a story said jud as he worked but just the logical disclosures in the case of me and that pink eyed snoozer from mired mule canada and miss willella learight i don t mind telling you i was punching then for old bill toomey on the san miguel one day i gets all ensnared up in aspirations for to eat some canned grub that hasn t ever mooed or baaed or grunted or been in peck measures so i gets on my bronc and pushes the wind for uncle emsley telfair s store at the pimienta crossing on the nueces about three in the afternoon i throwed my bridle rein over a mesquite limb and walked the last twenty yards into uncle emsley s store i got up on the counter and told uncle emsley that the signs pointed to the devastation of the fruit crop of the world in a minute i had a bag of crackers and a long handled spoon with an open can each of apricots and pineapples and cherries and greengages beside of me with uncle emsley busy chopping away with the hatchet at the yellow clings i was feeling like adam before the apple stampede and was digging my spurs into the side of the counter and working with my twenty four inch spoon when i happened to look out of the window into the yard of uncle emsley s house which was next to the store there was a girl standing there an imported girl with fixings on philandering with a croquet maul and amusing herself by watching my style of encouraging the fruit canning industry i slid off the counter and delivered up my shovel to uncle emsley that s my niece says he miss willella learight down from palestine on a visit do you want that i should make you acquainted the holy land i says to myself my thoughts milling some as i tried to run em into the corral why not there was sure angels

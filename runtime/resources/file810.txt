the table s d bris and turned his face from the window his movement dislodged a heavy law book which crashed upon the floor opening his eyes he saw bending over him a man in a black frock coat looking higher he discovered a well worn silk hat and beneath it the kindly smooth face of colonel abner coltrane a little uncertain of the outcome the colonel waited for the other to make some sign of recognition not in twenty years had male members of these two families faced each other in peace goree s eyelids puckered as he strained his blurred sight toward this visitor and then he smiled serenely have you brought stella and lucy over to play he said calmly do you know me yancey asked coltrane of course i do you brought me a whip with a whistle in the end so he had twenty four years ago when yancey s father was his best friend goree s eyes wandered about the room the colonel understood lie still and i ll bring you some said he there was a pump in the yard at the rear and goree closed his eyes listening with rapture to the click of its handle and the bubbling of the falling stream col trane brought a pitcher of the cool water and held it for him to drink presently goree sat up a most forlorn object his summer suit of flax soiled and crumpled his discreditable head tousled and unsteady he tried to wave one of his hands toward the colonel ex excuse everything will you he said i must have drunk too much whiskey last night and gone to bed on the table his brows knitted into a puzzled frown out with the boys awhile asked coltrane kindly no i went nowhere i haven t had a dollar to spend in the last two months struck the demijohn too often i reckon as usual colonel coltrane touched him on the shoulder a little while ago yancey he began you asked me if i had brought stella and lucy over to play you weren t quite awake then and must have been dreaming you were a boy again you are awake now and i want you to listen to me i have come from stella and lucy to their old playmate and to my old friend s son they know that i am going to bring you home with me and you will find them as ready with a welcome as they were in the old days i want you to come to my house and stay until you are yourself aain and as much longer as you will we heard of your being down in the world and in the midst of temptation and we agreed that you should come over and play at our house once more will you come my boy will you drop our old family trouble and come with me trouble said goree opening his eyes wide there was never any trouble between us that i know of i m sure we ve always been the best friends but good lord colonel how could i go to your home as i am a drunken wretch a miserable degraded spendthrift and gambler he lurched from the table into his armchair and began to weep maudlin tears mingled with genuine drops of remorse and shame coltrane talked to him persist ently and reasonably reminding him of the simple moun tain pleasures of which he had once been so fond and insisting upon the genuineness of the invitation finally he landed goree by telling him he was counting upon his help in the engineering and transportation of a large amount of felled timber from a high mountain side to a waterway he knew that goree had once invented a device for this purpose a series of slides and chutes upon which he had justly prided himself in an instant the poor fellow delighted at the idea of his being of use to any one had paper spread upon the table and was drawing rapid but pitifully shaky lines in demonstration of what he could and would do the man was sickened of the husks his prodigal heart was turning again toward the mountains his mind was yet strangely clogged and his thoughts and memories were returning to his brain one by one like carrier pigeons over a stormy sea but coltrane was satisfied with the progress he had made bethel received the surprise of its existence that after noon when a coltrane and a goree rode amicably together through the town side by side they rode out from the dusty streets and gaping townspeople down across the creek bridge and up toward the mountain the prodigal had brushed and washed and combed himself to a more decent figure but he was unsteady in the saddle and he seemed to be deep in the contemplation of some vexing problem coltrane left him in his mood relying upon the influence of changed surroundings to restore his equilibrium once goree was seized with a shaking fit and almost came to a collapse he had to dismount and rest at the side of the road the colonel foreseeing such a con dition had provided a small flask of whisky for the journey but when it was offered to him goree refused it almost with violence declaring he would never touch it again by and by he was recovered and went quietly enough for a mile or two then he pulled up his horse suddenly and said i lost two hundred dollars last night playing poker now where did i get that money take it easy yancev the mountain air will soon clear it up we ll go fishing first thing at the pinnacle falls the trout are jumping there like bullfrogs we ll take stella and lucy along and have a picnic on eagle rock have you forgotten how a hickory cured ham

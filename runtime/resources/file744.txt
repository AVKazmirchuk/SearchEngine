gave the order and the boat received its ultimate two passengers for upon the arm of the tall elderly gentleman as he crossed the gangway was a little elderly lady with a gray curl depending quaintly

guests who were doubtless on a scenery viewing expedition he stepped forward with that translucent child candid smile upon his fresh pink countenance with that air of unaffected sincerity that was

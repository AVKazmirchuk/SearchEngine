up the imaginary history of redruth and the fair being to whom he gave his heart i must in the beginning raise my voice against the unworthy insinuation that the selfishness or perfidy or love of luxury of any woman drove him to renounce the world i have not found woman to be so unspiritual or venal we must seek elsewhere among man s baser nature and lower motives for the cause there was in all probability a lover s quarrel as they stood at the gate on that memorable day tormented by jealousy young redruth vanished from his native haunts but had he just cause to do so there is no evidence for or against but there is something higher than evidence there is the grand eternal belief in woman s goodness in her steadfastness against temptation in her loyalty even in the face of proffered riches i picture to myself the rash lover wandering self tortured about the world i picture his gradual descent and finally his complete despair when he realises that he has lost the most precious gift life had to offer him then his withdrawal from the world of sorrow and the subsequent derangement of his faculties becomes intelligible but what do i see on the other hand a lonely woman fading away as the years roll by still faithful still waiting still watching for a form and listening for a step that will come no more she is old now her hair is white and smoothly banded each day she sits at the door and gazes longingly down the dusty road in spirit she is waiting there at the gate just as he left her his forever but not here below yes my belief in woman paints that picture in my mind parted forever on earth but waiting she in anticipation of a meeting in elysium he in the slough of despond i thought he was in the bughouse said the passenger who was nobody in particular judge menefee stirred a little impatiently the men sat drooping in grotesque attitudes the wind had abated its violence coming now in fitful virulent puffs the fire had burned to a mass of red coals which shed but a dim light within the room the lady passenger in her cosey nook looked to be but a formless dark bulk crowned by a mass of coiled sleek hair and showing but a small space of snowy forehead above her clinging boa judge menefee got stiffly to his feet and now miss garland he announced we have concluded it is for you to award the prize to the one of us whose argument especially i may say in regard to his estimate of true womanhood approaches nearest to your own conception no answer came from the lady passenger judge menefee bent over solicitously the passenger who was nobody in particular laughed low and harshly the lady was sleeping sweetly the judge essayed to take her hand to awaken her in doing so he touched a small cold round irregular something in her lap she has eaten the apple announced judge menefee in awed tones as he held up the core for them to see the missing chord i stopped overnight at the sheep ranch of rush kinney on the sandy fork of the nueces mr kinney and i had been strangers up to the time when i called hallo at his hitching rack but from that moment until my departure on the next morning we were according to the texas code undeniable friends after supper the ranchman and i lugged our chairs outside the two room house to its floorless gallery roofed with chaparral and sacuista grass with the rear legs of our chairs sinking deep into the hardpacked loam each of us reposed against an elm pillar of the structure and smoked el toro tobacco while we wrangled amicably concerning the affairs of the rest of the world as for conveying adequate conception of the engaging charm of that prairie evening despair waits upon it it is a bold chronicler who will undertake the description of a texas night in the early spring an inventory must suffice the ranch rested upon the summit of a lenient slope the ambient prairie diversified by arroyos and murky patches of brush and pear lay around us like a darkened bowl at the bottom of which we reposed as dregs like a turquoise cover the sky pinned us there the miraculous air heady with ozone and made memorably sweet by leagues of wild flowerets gave tang and savour to the breath in the sky was a great round mellow searchlight which we knew to be no moon but the dark lantern of summer who came to hunt northward the cowering spring in the nearest corral a flock of sheep lay silent until a groundless panic would send a squad of them huddling together with a drumming rush for other sounds a shrill family of coyotes yapped beyond the shearing pen and whippoorwills twittered in the long grass but even these dissonances hardly rippled the clear torrent of the mocking birds notes that fell from a dozen neighbouring shrubs and trees it would not have been preposterous for one to tiptoe and essay to touch the stars they hung so bright and imminent mr kinney s wife a young and capable woman we had left in the house she remained to busy herself with the domestic round of duties in which i had observed that she seemed to take a buoyant and contented pride in one room we had supped presently from the other as kinney and i sat without there burst a volume of sudden and brilliant music if i could justly estimate the art of piano playing the construer of that rollicking fantasia had creditably mastered the secrets of the keyboard a piano and one so well played seemed to me to be an unusual thing to find in that small and unpromising ranch house i must have looked my surprise at rush kinney for he laughed in his soft southern way and nodded at me through the moonlit haze of our cigarettes you don t often hear as agreeable a noise as that on a sheep ranch he remarked but i never see any reason for not playing up to the arts and graces just because we happen to live out in the brush it s a lonesome life for a woman and if a little music can make it any better why not have it that s the way i look at it a wise and generous theory i assented and mrs kinney plays well i am not learned in the science of music but i should call her an uncommonly good performer she has technic and more than ordinary power the moon was very bright you will understand and i saw upon kinney s face a sort of amused and pregnant expression as though there were things behind it that might be expounded you came up the trail from the double elm fork he said promisingly as you crossed it you must have seen an old deserted jacal to your left under a comma mott i did said i there was a drove of javalis rooting around it i could see by the broken corrals that no one lived there that s where this music proposition started said kinney i don t mind telling you about it while we smoke that s where old cal adams lived he had about eight hundred graded merinos and a daughter that was solid silk and as handsome as a new stake rope on a thirty dollar pony and i don t mind telling you that i was guilty in the second degree of hanging around old cal s ranch all the time i could spare away from lambing and shearing miss marilla was her name and i had figured it out by the rule of two that she was destined to become the chatelaine and lady superior of rancho lomito belonging to r kinney esq where you are now a welcome and honoured guest i will say that old cal wasn t distinguished as a sheepman he was a little old stoop shouldered hombre about as big as a gun scabbard with scraggy white whiskers and condemned to the continuous use of language old cal was so obscure in his chosen profession that he wasn t even hated by the cowmen and when a sheepman don t get eminent enough to acquire the hostility of the cattlemen he is mighty apt to die unwept and considerably unsung but that marilla girl was a benefit to the eye and she was the most elegant kind of a housekeeper i was the nearest neighbour and i used to ride over to the double elm anywhere from nine to sixteen times a week with fresh butter or a quarter of venison or a sample of new sheep dip just as a frivolous excuse to see marilla marilla and me got to be extensively inveigled with each other and i was pretty sure i was going to get my rope around her neck and lead her over to the lomito only she was so everlastingly permeated with filial sentiments toward old cal that i never could get her to talk about serious matters you never saw anybody in your life that was as full of knowledge and had less sense than old cal he was advised about all the branches of information contained in learning and he was up to all the rudiments of doctrines and enlightenment you couldn t advance him any ideas on any of the parts of speech or lines of thought you would have thought he was a professor of the weather and politics and chemistry and natural history and the origin of derivations any subject you brought up old cal could give you an abundant synopsis of it from the greek root up to the time it was sacked and on the market one day just after the fall shearing i rides over to the double elm with a lady s magazine about fashions for marilla and a scientific paper for old cal while i was tying my pony to a mesquite out runs marilla tickled to death with some news that couldn t wait oh rush she says all flushed up with esteem and gratification what do you think dad s going to buy me a piano ain t it grand i never dreamed i d ever have one it s sure joyful says i i always admired the agreeable uproar of a piano it ll be lots of company for you that s mighty good of uncle cal to do that i m all undecided says marilla between a piano and an organ a parlour organ is nice either of em says i is first class for mitigating the lack of noise around a sheep ranch for my part i says i shouldn t like anything better than to ride home of an evening and listen to a few waltzes and jigs with somebody about your size sitting on the piano stool and rounding up the notes oh hush about that says marilla and go on in the house dad hasn t rode out to day he s not feeling well old cal was inside lying on a cot he had a pretty bad cold and cough i stayed to supper going to get marilla a piano i hear says i to him why yes something of the kind rush says he she s been hankering for music for a long spell and i allow to fix her up with something in that line right away the sheep sheared six pounds all round this fall and i m going to get marilla an instrument if it takes the price of the whole clip to do it star wayno says i the little girl deserves it i m going to san antone on the last load of wool says uncle cal and select an instrument for her myself wouldn t it be better i suggests to take marilla along and let her pick out one that she likes i might have known that would set uncle cal going of course a man like him that knew everything about everything would look at that as a reflection on his attainments no sir it wouldn t says he pulling at his white whiskers there ain t a better judge of musical instruments in the whole world than what i am i had an uncle says he that was a partner in a piano factory and i ve seen thousands of em put together i know all about musical instruments from a pipe organ to a corn stalk fiddle there ain t a man lives sir that can tell me any news about any instrument that has to be pounded blowed scraped grinded picked or wound with a key you get me what you like dad says marilla who couldn t keep her feet on the floor from joy of course you know what to select i d just as lief it was a piano or a organ or what i see in st louis once what they call a orchestrion says uncle cal that i judged was about the finest thing in the way of music ever invented but there ain t room in this house for one anyway i imagine they d cost a thousand dollars i reckon something in the piano line would suit marilla the best she took lessons in that respect for two years over at birdstail i wouldn t trust the buying of an instrument to anybody else but myself i reckon if i hadn t took up sheep raising i d have been one of the finest composers or piano and organ manufacturers in the world that was uncle cal s style but i never lost any patience with him on account of his thinking so much of marilla and she thought just as much of him he sent her to the academy over at birdstail for two years when it took nearly every pound of wool to pay the expenses along about tuesday uncle cal put out for san antone on the last wagonload of wool marilla s uncle ben who lived in birdstail come over and stayed at the ranch while uncle cal was gone it was ninety miles to san antone and forty to the nearest railroad station so uncle cal was gone about four days i was over at the double elm when he came rolling back one evening about sundown and up there in the wagon sure enough was a piano or a organ we couldn t tell which all wrapped up in woolsacks with a wagon sheet tied over it in case of rain and out skips marilla hollering oh oh with her eyes shining and her hair a flying dad dad she sings out have you brought it have you brought it and it right there before her eyes as women will do finest piano in san antone says uncle cal waving his hand proud genuine rosewood and the finest loudest tone you ever listened to i heard the storekeeper play it and i took it on the spot and paid cash down me and ben and uncle cal and a mexican lifted it out of the wagon and carried it in the house and set it in a corner it was one of them upright instruments and not very heavy or very big and then all of a sudden uncle cal flops over and says he s mighty sick he s got a high fever and he complains of his lungs he gets into bed while me and ben goes out to unhitch and put the horses in the pasture and marilla flies around to get uncle cal something hot to drink but first she puts both arms on that piano and hugs it with a soft kind of a smile like you see kids doing with their christmas toys when i came in from the pasture marilla was in the room where the piano was i could see by the strings and woolsacks on the floor that she had had it unwrapped but now she was tying the wagon sheet over it again and there was a kind of solemn whitish look on her face ain t wrapping up the music again are you marilla i asks what s the matter with just a couple of tunes for to see how she goes under the saddle not to night rush says she i don t want to play any to night dad s too sick just think rush he paid three hundred dollars for it nearly a third of what the wool clip brought well it ain t anyways in the neighbourhood of a third of what you are worth i told her and i don t think uncle cal is too sick to hear a little agitation of the piano keys just to christen the machine not to night rush says marilla in a way that she had when she wanted to settle things but it seems that uncle cal was plenty sick after all he got so bad that ben saddled up and rode over to birdstail for doc simpson i stayed around to see if i d be needed for anything when uncle cal s pain let up on him a little he called marilla and says to her did you look at your instrument honey and do you like it it s lovely dad says she leaning down by his pillow i never saw one so pretty how dear and good it was of you to buy it for me i haven t heard you play on it any yet says uncle cal and i ve been listening my side don t hurt quite so bad now won t you play a piece marilla but no she puts uncle cal off and soothes him down like you ve seen women do with a kid it seems she s made up her mind not to touch that piano at present when doc simpson comes over he tells us that uncle cal has pneumonia the worst kind and as the old man was past sixty and nearly on the lift anyhow the odds was against his walking on grass any more on the fourth day of his sickness he calls for marilla again and wants to talk piano doc simpson was there and so was ben and mrs ben trying to do all they could i d have made a wonderful success in anything connected with music says uncle cal i got the finest instrument for the money in san antone ain t that piano all right in every respect marilla it s just perfect dad says she it s got the finest tone i ever heard but don t you think you could sleep a little while now dad no i don t says uncle cal i want to hear that piano i don t believe you ve even tried it yet i went all the way to san antone and picked it out for you myself it took a third of the fall clip to buy it but i don t mind that if it makes my good girl happier won t you play a little bit for dad marilla doc simpson beckoned marilla to one side and recommended her to do what uncle cal wanted so it would get him quieted and her uncle ben and his wife asked her too why not hit out a tune or two with the soft pedal on i asks marilla uncle cal has begged you so often it would please him a good deal to hear you touch up the piano he s bought for you don t you think you might but marilla stands there with big tears rolling down from her eyes and says nothing and then she runs over and slips her arm under uncle cal s neck and hugs him tight why last night dad we heard her say i played it ever so much honest i have been playing it and it s such a splendid instrument you don t know how i love it last night i played bonnie dundee and the anvil polka and the blue danube and lots of pieces you must surely have heard me playing a little didn t you dad i didn t like to play loud when you was so sick well well says uncle cal maybe i did maybe i did and forgot about it my head is a little cranky at times i heard the man in the store play it fine i m mighty glad you like it marilla yes i believe i could go to sleep a while if you ll stay right beside me till i do there was where marilla had me guessing much as she thought of that old man she wouldn t strike a note on that piano that he d bought her i couldn t imagine why she told him she d been playing it for the wagon sheet hadn t ever been off of it since she put it back on the same day it come i knew she could play a little anyhow for i d once heard her snatch some pretty fair dance music out of an old piano at the charco largo ranch well in about a week the pneumonia got the best of uncle cal they had the funeral over at birdstail and all of us went over i brought marilla back home in my buckboard her uncle ben and his wife were going to stay there a few days with her that night marilla takes me in the room where the piano was while the others were out on the gallery come here rush says she i want you to see this now she unties the rope and drags off the wagon sheet if you ever rode a saddle without a horse or fired off a gun that wasn t loaded or took a drink out of an empty bottle why then you might have been able to scare an opera or two out of the instrument uncle cal had bought instead of a piano it was one of the machines they ve invented to play the piano with by itself it was about as musical as the holes of a flute without the flute and that was the piano that uncle cal had selected and standing by it was the good fine all wool girl that never let him know it and what you heard playing a while ago concluded mr kinney was that same deputy piano machine only just at present it s shoved up against a six hundred dollar piano that i bought for marilla as soon as we was married a call loan in those days the cattlemen were the anointed they were the grandees of the grass kings of the kine lords of the lea barons of beef and bone they might have ridden in golden chariots had their tastes so inclined the cattleman was caught in a stampede of dollars it seemed to him that he had more money than was decent but when he had bought a watch with precious stones set in the case so large that they hurt his ribs and a california saddle with silver nails and angora skin suaderos and ordered everybody up to the bar for whisky what else was there for him to spend money for not so circumscribed in expedient for the reduction of surplus wealth were those lairds of the lariat who had womenfolk to their name in the breast of the rib sprung sex the genius of purse lightening may slumber through years of inopportunity but never my brothers does it become extinct so out of the chaparral came long bill longley from the bar circle branch on the frio a wife driven man to taste the urban joys of success something like half a million dollars he had with an income steadily increasing long bill was a graduate of the camp and trail luck and thrift a cool head and a telescopic eye for mavericks had raised him from cowboy to be a cowman then came the boom in cattle and fortune stepping gingerly among the cactus thorns came and emptied her cornucopia at the doorstep of the ranch in the little frontier city of chaparosa longley built a costly residence here he became a captive bound to the chariot of social existence he was doomed to become a leading citizen he struggled for a time like a mustang in his first corral and then he hung up his quirt and spurs time hung heavily on his hands he organised the first national bank of chaparosa and was elected its president one day a dyspeptic man wearing double magnifying glasses inserted an official looking card between the bars of the cashier s window of the first national bank five minutes later the bank force was dancing at the beck and call of a national bank examiner this examiner mr j edgar todd proved to be a thorough one at the end of it all the examiner put on his hat and called the president mr william r longley into the private office well how do you find things asked longley in his slow deep tones any brands in the round up you didn t like the looks of the bank checks up all right mr longley said todd and i find your loans in very good shape with one exception you are carrying one very bad bit of paper one that is so bad that i have been thinking that you surely do not realise the serious position it places you in i refer to a call loan of made to thomas merwin not only is the amount in excess of the maximum sum the bank can loan any individual legally but it is absolutely without endorsement or security thus you have doubly violated the national banking laws and have laid yourself open to criminal prosecution by the government a report of the matter to the comptroller of the currency which i am bound to make would i am sure result in the matter being turned over to the department of justice for action you see what a serious thing it is bill longley was leaning his lengthy slowly moving frame back in his swivel chair his hands were clasped behind his head and he turned a little to look the examiner in the face the examiner was surprised to see a smile creep about the rugged mouth of the banker and a kindly twinkle in his light blue eyes if he saw the seriousness of the affair it did not show in his countenance of course you don t know tom merwin said longley almost genially yes i know about that loan it hasn t any security except tom merwin s word somehow i ve always found that when a man s word is good it s the best security there is oh yes i know the government doesn t think so i guess i ll see tom about that note mr todd s dyspepsia seemed to grow suddenly worse he looked at the chaparral banker through his double magnifying glasses in amazement you see said longley easily explaining the thing away tom heard of head of two year olds down near rocky ford on the rio grande that could be had for a head i reckon twas one of old leandro garcia s outfits that he had smuggled over and he wanted to make a quick turn on em those cattle are worth on the hoof in kansas city tom knew it and i knew it he had and i let him have the to make the deal with his brother ed took em on to market three weeks ago he ought to be back most any day now with the money when he comes tom ll pay that note the bank examiner was shocked it was perhaps his duty to step out to the telegraph office and wire the situation to the comptroller but he did not he talked pointedly and effectively to longley for three minutes he succeeded in making the banker understand that he stood upon the border of a catastrophe and then he offered a tiny loophole of escape i am going to hilldale s to night he told longley to examine a bank there i will pass through chaparosa on my way back at twelve o clock to morrow i shall call at this bank if this loan has been cleared out of the way by that time it will not be mentioned in my report if not i will have to do my duty with that the examiner bowed and departed the president of the first national lounged in his chair half an hour longer and then he lit a mild cigar and went over to tom merwin s house merwin a ranchman in brown duck with a contemplative eye sat with his feet upon a table plaiting a rawhide quirt tom said longley leaning against the table you heard anything from ed yet not yet said merwin continuing his plaiting i guess ed ll be along back now in a few days there was a bank examiner said longley nosing around our place to day and he bucked a sight about that note of yours you know i know it s all right but the thing is against the banking laws i was pretty sure you d have paid it off before the bank was examined again but the son of a gun slipped in on us tom now i m short of cash myself just now or i d let you have the money to take it up with i ve got till twelve o clock to morrow and then i ve got to show the cash in place of that note or or what bill asked merwin as longley hesitated well i suppose it means be jumped on with both of uncle sam s feet i ll try to raise the money for you on time said merwin interested in his plaiting all right tom concluded longley as he turned toward the door i knew you would if you could merwin threw down his whip and went to the only other bank in town a private one run by cooper craig cooper he said to the partner by that name i ve got to have to day or to morrow i ve got a house and lot there that s worth about and that s all the actual collateral but i ve got a cattle deal on that s sure to bring me in more than that much profit within a few days cooper began to cough now for god s sake don t say no said merwin i owe that much money on a call loan it s been called and the man that called it is a man i ve laid on the same blanket with in cow camps and ranger camps for ten years he can call anything i ve got he can call the blood out of my veins and it ll come he s got to have the money he s in a devil of a well he needs the money and i ve got to get it for him you know my word s good cooper no doubt of it assented cooper urbanely but i ve a partner you know i m not free in making loans and even if you had the best security in your hands merwin we couldn t accommodate you in less than a week we re just making a shipment of to myer brothers in rockdell to buy cotton with it goes down on the narrow gauge to night that leaves our cash quite short at present sorry we can t arrange it for you merwin went back to his little bare office and plaited at his quirt again about four o clock in the afternoon he went to the first national bank and leaned over the railing of longley s desk i ll try to get that money for you to night i mean to morrow bill all right tom said longley quietly at nine o clock that night tom merwin stepped cautiously out of the small frame house in which he lived it was near the edge of the little town and few citizens were in the neighbourhood at that hour merwin wore two six shooters in a belt and a slouch hat he moved swiftly down a lonely street and then followed the sandy road that ran parallel to the narrow gauge track until he reached the water tank two miles below the town there tom merwin stopped tied a black silk handkerchief about the lower part of his face and pulled his hat down low in ten minutes the night train for rockdell pulled up at the tank having come from chaparosa with a gun in each hand merwin raised himself from behind a clump of chaparral and started for the engine but before he had taken three steps two long strong arms clasped him from behind and he was lifted from his feet and thrown face downward upon the grass there was a heavy knee pressing against his back and an iron hand grasping each of his wrists he was held thus like a child until the engine had taken water and until the train had moved with accelerating speed out of sight then he was released and rose to his feet to face bill longley the case never needed to be fixed up this way tom said longley i saw cooper this evening and he told me what you and him talked about then i went down to your house to night and saw you come out with your guns on and i followed you let s go back tom they walked away together side by side twas the only chance i saw said merwin presently you called your loan and i tried to answer you now what ll you do bill if they sock it to you what would you have done if they d socked it to you was the answer longley made i never thought i d lay in a bush to stick up a train remarked merwin but a call loan s different a call s a call with me we ve got twelve hours yet bill before this spy jumps onto you we ve got to raise them spondulicks somehow maybe we can great sam houston do you hear that merwin broke into a run and longley kept with him hearing only a rather pleasing whistle somewhere in the night rendering the lugubrious air of the cowboy s lament it s the only tune he knows shouted merwin as he ran i ll bet they were at the door of merwin s house he kicked it open and fell over an old valise lying in the middle of the floor a sunburned firm jawed youth stained by travel lay upon the bed puffing at a brown cigarette what s the word ed gasped merwin so so drawled that capable youngster just got in on the sold the bunch for fifteen straight now buddy you want to quit kickin a valise around that s got in greenbacks in its in ards the princess and the puma there had to be a king and queen of course the king was a terrible old man who wore six shooters and spurs and shouted in such a tremendous voice that the rattlers on the prairie would run into their holes under the prickly pear before there was a royal family they called the man whispering ben when he came to own acres of land and more cattle than he could count they called him o donnell the cattle king the queen had been a mexican girl from laredo she made a good mild colorado claro wife and even succeeded in teaching ben to modify his voice sufficiently while in the house to keep the dishes from being broken when ben got to be king she would sit on the gallery of espinosa ranch and weave rush mats when wealth became so irresistible and oppressive that upholstered chairs and a centre table were brought down from san antone in the wagons she bowed her smooth dark head and shared the fate of the danae to avoid lese majeste you have been presented first to the king and queen they do not enter the story which might be called the chronicle of the princess the happy thought and the lion that bungled his job josefa o donnell was the surviving daughter the princess from her mother she inherited warmth of nature and a dusky semi tropic beauty from ben o donnell the royal she acquired a store of intrepidity common sense and the faculty of ruling the combination was one worth going miles to see josefa while riding her pony at a gallop could put five out of six bullets through a tomato can swinging at the end of a string she could play for hours with a white kitten she owned dressing it in all manner of absurd clothes scorning a pencil she could tell you out of her head what two year olds would bring on the hoof at per head roughly speaking the espinosa ranch is forty miles long and thirty broad but mostly leased land josefa on her pony had prospected over every mile of it every cow puncher on the range knew her by sight and was a loyal vassal ripley givens foreman of one of the espinosa outfits saw her one day and made up his mind to form a royal matrimonial alliance presumptuous no in those days in the nueces country a man was a man and after all the title of cattle king does not presuppose blood royalty often it only signifies that its owner wears the crown in token of his magnificent qualities in the art of cattle stealing one day ripley givens rode over to the double elm ranch to inquire about a bunch of strayed yearlings he was late in setting out on his return trip and it was sundown when he struck the white horse crossing of the nueces from there to his own camp it was sixteen miles to the espinosa ranch it was twelve givens was tired he decided to pass the night at the crossing there was a fine water hole in the river bed the banks were thickly covered with great trees undergrown with brush back from the water hole fifty yards was a stretch of curly mesquite grass supper for his horse and bed for himself givens staked his horse and spread out his saddle blankets to dry he sat down with his back against a tree and rolled a cigarette from somewhere in the dense timber along the river came a sudden rageful shivering wail the pony danced at the end of his rope and blew a whistling snort of comprehending fear givens puffed at his cigarette but he reached leisurely for his pistol belt which lay on the grass and twirled the cylinder of his weapon tentatively a great gar plunged with a loud splash into the water hole a little brown rabbit skipped around a bunch of catclaw and sat twitching his whiskers and looking humorously at givens the pony went on eating grass it is well to be reasonably watchful when a mexican lion sings soprano along the arroyos at sundown the burden of his song may be that young calves and fat lambs are scarce and that he has a carnivorous desire for your acquaintance in the grass lay an empty fruit can cast there by some former sojourner givens caught sight of it with a grunt of satisfaction in his coat pocket tied behind his saddle was a handful or two of ground coffee black coffee and cigarettes what ranchero could desire more in two minutes he had a little fire going clearly he started with his can for the water hole when within fifteen yards of its edge he saw between the bushes a side saddled pony with down dropped reins cropping grass a little distance to his left just rising from her hands and knees on the brink of the water hole was josefa o donnell she had been drinking water and she brushed the sand from the palms of her hands ten yards away to her right half concealed by a clump of sacuista givens saw the crouching form of the mexican lion his amber eyeballs glared hungrily six feet from them was the tip of the tail stretched straight like a pointer s his hind quarters rocked with the motion of the cat tribe preliminary to leaping givens did what he could his six shooter was thirty five yards away lying on the grass he gave a loud yell and dashed between the lion and the princess the rucus as givens called it afterward was brief and somewhat confused when he arrived on the line of attack he saw a dim streak in the air and heard a couple of faint cracks then a hundred pounds of mexican lion plumped down upon his head and flattened him with a heavy jar to the ground he remembered calling out let up now no fair gouging and then he crawled from under the lion like a worm with his mouth full of grass and dirt and a big lump on the back of his head where it had struck the root of a water elm the lion lay motionless givens feeling aggrieved and suspicious of fouls shook his fist at the lion and shouted i ll rastle you again for twenty and then he got back to himself josefa was standing in her tracks quietly reloading her silver mounted it had not been a difficult shot the lion s head made an easier mark than a tomato can swinging at the end of a string there was a provoking teasing maddening smile upon her mouth and in her dark eyes the would be rescuing knight felt the fire of his fiasco burn down to his soul here had been his chance the chance that he had dreamed of and momus and not cupid had presided over it the satyrs in the wood were no doubt holding their sides in hilarious silent laughter there had been something like vaudeville say signor givens and his funny knockabout act with the stuffed lion is that you mr givens said josefa in her deliberate saccharine contralto you nearly spoilt my shot when you yelled did you hurt your head when you fell oh no said givens quietly that didn t hurt he stooped ignominiously and dragged his best stetson hat from under the beast it was crushed and wrinkled to a fine comedy effect then he knelt down and softly stroked the fierce open jawed head of the dead lion poor old bill he exclaimed mournfully what s that asked josefa sharply of course you didn t know miss josefa said givens with an air of one allowing magnanimity to triumph over grief nobody can blame you i tried to save him but i couldn t let you know in time save who why bill i ve been looking for him all day you see he s been our camp pet for two years poor old fellow he wouldn t have hurt a cottontail rabbit it ll break the boys all up when they hear about it but you couldn t tell of course that bill was just trying to play with you josefa s black eyes burned steadily upon him ripley givens met the test successfully he stood rumpling the yellow brown curls on his head pensively in his eye was regret not unmingled with a gentle reproach his smooth features were set to a pattern of indisputable sorrow josefa wavered what was your pet doing here she asked making a last stand there s no camp near the white horse crossing the old rascal ran away from camp yesterday answered givens readily it s a wonder the coyotes didn t scare him to death you see jim webster our horse wrangler brought a little terrier pup into camp last week the pup made life miserable for bill he used to chase him around and chew his hind legs for hours at a time every night when bedtime came bill would sneak under one of the boy s blankets and sleep to keep the pup from finding him i reckon he must have been worried pretty desperate or he wouldn t have run away he was always afraid to get out of sight of camp josefa looked at the body of the fierce animal givens gently patted one of the formidable paws that could have killed a yearling calf with one blow slowly a red flush widened upon the dark olive face of the girl was it the signal of shame of the true sportsman who has brought down ignoble quarry her eyes grew softer and the lowered lids drove away all their bright mockery i m very sorry she said humbly but he looked so big and jumped so high that poor old bill was hungry interrupted givens in quick defence of the deceased we always made him jump for his supper in camp he would lie down and roll over for a piece of meat when he saw you he thought he was going to get something to eat from you suddenly josefa s eyes opened wide i might have shot you she exclaimed you ran right in between you risked your life to save your pet that was fine mr givens i like a man who is kind to animals yes there was even admiration in her gaze now after all there was a hero rising out of the ruins of the anti climax the look on givens s face would have secured him a high position in the s p c a i always loved em said he horses dogs mexican lions cows alligators i hate alligators instantly demurred josefa crawly muddy things did i say alligators said givens i meant antelopes of course josefa s conscience drove her to make further amends she held out her hand penitently there was a bright unshed drop in each of her eyes please forgive me mr givens won t you i m only a girl you know and i was frightened at first i m very very sorry i shot bill you don t know how ashamed i feel i wouldn t have done it for anything givens took the proffered hand he held it for a time while he allowed the generosity of his nature to overcome his grief at the loss of bill at last it was clear that he had forgiven her please don t speak of it any more miss josefa twas enough to frighten any young lady the way bill looked i ll explain it all right to the boys are you really sure you don t hate me josefa came closer to him impulsively her eyes were sweet oh sweet and pleading with gracious penitence i would hate anyone who would kill my kitten and how daring and kind of you to risk being shot when you tried to save him how very few men would have done that victory wrested from defeat vaudeville turned into drama bravo ripley givens it was now twilight of course miss josefa could not be allowed to ride on to the ranch house alone givens resaddled his pony in spite of that animal s reproachful glances and rode with her side by side they galloped across the smooth grass the princess and the man who was kind to animals the prairie odours of fruitful earth and delicate bloom were thick and sweet around them coyotes yelping over there on the hill no fear and yet josefa rode closer a little hand seemed to grope givens found it with his own the ponies kept an even gait the hands lingered together and the owner of one explained i never was frightened before but just think how terrible it would be to meet a really wild lion poor bill i m so glad you came with me o donnell was sitting on the ranch gallery hello rip he shouted that you he rode in with me said josefa i lost my way and was late much obliged called the cattle king stop over rip and ride to camp in the morning but givens would not he would push on to camp there was a bunch of steers to start off on the trail at daybreak he said good night and trotted away an hour later when the lights were out josefa in her night robe came to her door and called to the king in his own room across the brick paved hallway say pop you know that old mexican lion they call the gotch eared devil the one that killed gonzales mr martin s sheep herder and about fifty calves on the salado range well i settled his hash this afternoon over at the white horse crossing put two balls in his head with my while he was on the jump i knew him by the slice gone from his left ear that old gonzales cut off with his machete you couldn t have made a better shot yourself daddy bully for you thundered whispering ben from the darkness of the royal chamber the indian summer of dry valley johnson dry valley johnson shook the bottle you have to shake the bottle before using for sulphur will not dissolve then dry valley saturated a small sponge with the liquid and rubbed it carefully into the roots of his hair besides sulphur there was sugar of lead in it and tincture of nux vomica and bay rum dry valley found the recipe in a sunday newspaper you must next be told why a strong man came to fall a victim to a beauty hint dry valley had been a sheepman his real name was hector but he had been rechristened after his range to distinguish him from elm creek johnson who ran sheep further down the frio many years of living face to face with sheep on their own terms wearied dry valley johnson so he sold his ranch for eighteen thousand dollars and moved to santa rosa to live a life of gentlemanly ease being a silent and melancholy person of thirty five or perhaps thirty eight he soon became that cursed and earth cumbering thing an elderlyish bachelor with a hobby some one gave him his first strawberry to eat and he was done for dry valley bought a four room cottage in the village and a library on strawberry culture behind the cottage was a garden of which he made a strawberry patch in his old grey woolen shirt his brown duck trousers and high heeled boots he sprawled all day on a canvas cot under a live oak tree at his back door studying the history of the seductive scarlet berry the school teacher miss de witt spoke of him as a fine presentable man for all his middle age but the focus of dry valley s eyes embraced no women they were merely beings who flew skirts as a signal for him to lift awkwardly his heavy round crowned broad brimmed felt stetson whenever he met them and then hurry past to get back to his beloved berries and all this recitative by the chorus is only to bring us to the point where you may be told why dry valley shook up the insoluble sulphur in the bottle so long drawn and inconsequential a thing is history the anamorphous shadow of a milestone reaching down the road between us and the setting sun when his strawberries were beginning to ripen dry valley bought the heaviest buggy whip in the santa rosa store he sat for many hours under the live oak tree plaiting and weaving in an extension to its lash when it was done he could snip a leaf from a bush twenty feet away with the cracker for the bright predatory eyes of santa rosa youth were watching the ripening berries and dry valley was arming himself against their expected raids no greater care had he taken of his tender lambs during his ranching days than he did of his cherished fruit warding it from the hungry wolves that whistled and howled and shot their marbles and peered through the fence that surrounded his property in the house next to dry valley s lived a widow with a pack of children that gave the husbandman frequent anxious misgivings in the woman there was a strain of the spanish she had wedded one of the name of o brien dry valley was a connoisseur in cross strains and he foresaw trouble in the offspring of this union between the two homesteads ran a crazy picket fence overgrown with morning glory and wild gourd vines often he could see little heads with mops of black hair and flashing dark eyes dodging in and out between the pickets keeping tabs on the reddening berries late one afternoon dry valley went to the post office when he came back like mother hubbard he found the deuce to pay the descendants of iberian bandits and hibernian cattle raiders had swooped down upon his strawberry patch to the outraged vision of dry valley there seemed to be a sheep corral full of them perhaps they numbered five or six between the rows of green plants they were stooped hopping about like toads gobbling silently and voraciously his finest fruit dry valley slipped into the house got his whip and charged the marauders the lash curled about the legs of the nearest a greedy ten year old before they knew they were discovered his screech gave warning and the flock scampered for the fence like a drove of javelis flushed in the chaparral dry valley s whip drew a toll of two more elfin shrieks before they dived through the vine clad fence and disappeared dry valley less fleet followed them nearly to the pickets checking his useless pursuit he rounded a bush dropped his whip and stood voiceless motionless the capacity of his powers consumed by the act of breathing and preserving the perpendicular behind the bush stood panchita o brien scorning to fly she was nineteen the oldest of the raiders her night black hair was gathered back in a wild mass and tied with a scarlet ribbon she stood with reluctant feet yet nearer the brook than to the river for childhood had environed and detained her she looked at dry valley johnson for a moment with magnificent insolence and before his eyes slowly crunched a luscious berry between her white teeth then she turned and walked slowly to the fence with a swaying conscious motion such as a duchess might make use of in leading a promenade there she turned again and grilled dry valley johnson once more in the dark flame of her audacious eyes laughed a trifle school girlishly and twisted herself with pantherish quickness between the pickets to the o brien side of the wild gourd vine dry valley picked up his whip and went into his house he stumbled as he went up the two wooden steps the old mexican woman who cooked his meals and swept his house called him to supper as he went through the rooms dry valley went on stumbled down the front steps out the gate and down the road into a mesquite thicket at the edge of town he sat down in the grass and laboriously plucked the spines from a prickly pear one by one this was his attitude of thought acquired in the days when his problems were only those of wind and wool and water a thing had happened to the man a thing that if you are eligible you must pray may pass you by he had become enveloped in the indian summer of the soul dry valley had had no youth even his childhood had been one of dignity and seriousness at six he had viewed the frivolous gambols of the lambs on his father s ranch with silent disapproval his life as a young man had been wasted the divine fires and impulses the glorious exaltations and despairs the glow and enchantment of youth had passed above his head never a thrill of romeo had he known he was but a melancholy jaques of the forest with a ruder philosophy lacking the bitter sweet flavour of experience that tempered the veteran years of the rugged ranger of arden and now in his sere and yellow leaf one scornful look from the eyes of panchita o brien had flooded the autumnal landscape with a tardy and delusive summer heat but a sheepman is a hardy animal dry valley johnson had weathered too many northers to turn his back on a late summer spiritual or real old he would show them by the next mail went an order to san antonio for an outfit of the latest clothes colours and styles and prices no object the next day went the recipe for the hair restorer clipped from a newspaper for dry valley s sunburned auburn hair was beginning to turn silvery above his ears dry valley kept indoors closely for a week except for frequent sallies after youthful strawberry snatchers then a few days later he suddenly emerged brilliantly radiant in the hectic glow of his belated midsummer madness a jay bird blue tennis suit covered him outwardly almost as far as his wrists and ankles his shirt was ox blood his collar winged and tall his necktie a floating oriflamme his shoes a venomous bright tan pointed and shaped on penitential lasts a little flat straw hat with a striped band desecrated his weather beaten head lemon coloured kid gloves protected his oak tough hands from the benignant may sunshine this sad and optic smiting creature teetered out of its den smiling foolishly and smoothing its gloves for men and angels to see to such a pass had dry valley johnson been brought by cupid who always shoots game that is out of season with an arrow from the quiver of momus reconstructing mythology he had risen a prismatic macaw from the ashes of the grey brown phoenix that had folded its tired wings to roost under the trees of santa rosa dry valley paused in the street to allow santa rosans within sight of him to be stunned and then deliberately and slowly as his shoes required entered mrs o brien s gate not until the eleven months drought did santa rosa cease talking about dry valley johnson s courtship of panchita o brien it was an unclassifiable procedure something like a combination of cake walking deaf and dumb oratory postage stamp flirtation and parlour charades it lasted two weeks and then came to a sudden end of course mrs o brien favoured the match as soon as dry valley s intentions were disclosed being the mother of

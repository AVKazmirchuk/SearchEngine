fire escape and bore away a ruby tiara valued at two thousand dollars and a five hundred dollar prize spitz dog which in violation of the expectoration ordinance was making free with the halls of the wuttapesituckquesunoowetunquah apartments my second chiel will take notes to the effect that while a friendly game of pinochle was in progress in the tenement rooms of mrs andy mccarty a lady guest named ruby o hara threw a burglar down six flights of stairs where he was pinioned and held by a two thousand dollar english bulldog amid a crowd of five hundred excited spectators my third chronicler and friend will gather the news threads of the happening in his own happy way setting forth on the page for you to read that the house of antonio macartini was blown up at a m by the black hand society on his refusing to leave two thousand dollars at a certain street corner killing a pet five hundred dollar pomeranian belonging to alderman rubitara s little daughter see photo and diagram opposite number four of my history makers will simply construe from the premises the story that while an audience of two thousand enthusiasts was listening to a rubinstein concert on sixth street a woman who said she was mrs andrew m carter threw a brick through a plate glass window valued at five hundred dollars the carter woman claimed that some one in the building had stolen her dog now the discrepancies in these registrations of the day s doings need do no one hurt surely one newspaper is enough for any man to prop against his morning water bottle to fend off the smiling hatred of his wife s glance if he be foolish enough to read four he is no wiser than a higher critic i remember probably as well as you do having read the parable of the talents a prominent citizen about to journey into a far country first hands over to his servants his goods to one he gives five talents to another two to another one to every man according to his several ability as the text has it there are two versions of this parable as you well know there may be more i do not know when the p c returns he requires an accounting two servants have put their talents out at usury and gained one hundred per cent good the unprofitable one simply digs up the talent deposited with him and hands it out on demand a pattern of behavior for trust companies and banks surely in one version we read that he had wrapped it in a napkin and laid it away but the commentator informs us that the talent mentioned was composed of ounces of silver about worth so the chronicler who mentioned the napkin had either to reduce the amount of the deposit or do a lot of explaining about the size of the napery used in those davs therefore in his version we note that he uses the word pound instead of talent a pound of silver may very well be laid away and carried away in a napkin as any hotel or restaurant man will tell you but let us get away from our mutton when the returned nobleman finds that the one talented servant has nothing to hand over except the original fund entrusted to him he is as angry as a multi millionaire would be if some one should hide under his bed and make a noise like an assessment he orders the unprofitable servant cast into outer darkness after first taking away his talent and giving it to the one hundred per cent financier and breathing strange saws saying from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath which is the same as to say nothing from nothing leaves nothing and now closer draw the threads of parable precept allegory and narrative leading nowhere if you will or else weaving themselves into the little fiction story about cliff mcgowan and his one talent there is but a definition to follow and then the homely actors trip on talent a gift endowment or faculty some peculiar ability power or accomplishment natural or acquired a metaphor borrowed from the parable in matt xxv l in new york city to day there are estimated living creatures training

talented singing dancing imitations trick bicycle riding boxing german and irish dialect comedy and a little sleight of hand and balancing of wheat straws and wheelbarrows on the ends of their chins

come to rescue them grumblingly because two days later would begin the great fair and races in san antone consider that at that time san antone was the hub of the wheel of fortune and the names of its spokes were cattle wool faro running horses and ozone in those times cattlemen played at crack loo on the sidewalks with double eagles and gentlemen backed their conception of the fortuitous card with stacks limited in height only by the interference of gravity wherefore thither journeyed the sowers and the reapers they who stampeded the dollars and they who rounded them up especially did the caterers to the amusement of the people haste to san antone two greatest shows on earth were already there and dozens of smallest ones were on the way on a side track near the mean little dobe depot stood a private car left there by the mexican train that morning and doomed by an ineffectual schedule to ignobly await amid squalid surroundings connection with the next day s regular the car had been once a common day coach but those who had sat in it and gringed to the conductor s hat band slips would never have recognised it in its transformation paint and gilding and certain domestic touches had liberated it from any suspicion of public servitude the whitest of lace curtains judiciously screened its windows from its fore end drooped in the torrid air the flag of mexico from its rear projected the stars and stripes and a busy stovepipe the latter reinforcing in its suggestion of culinary comforts the general suggestion of privacy and ease the beholder s eye regarding its gorgeous sides found interest to culminate in a single name in gold and blue letters extending almost its entire length a single name the audacious privilege of royalty and genius doubly then was this arrogant nomenclature here justified for the name was that of alvarita queen of the serpent tribe this her car was back from a triumphant tour of the principal mexican cities and now headed for san antonio where according to promissory advertisement she would exhibit her marvellous dominion and fearless control over deadly and venomous serpents handling them with ease as they coil and hiss to the terror of thousands of tongue tied tremblers one hundred in the shade kept the vicinity somewhat depeopled this quarter of the town was a ragged edge its denizens the bubbling froth of five nations its architecture tent jacal and dobe its distractions the hurdy gurdy and the informal contribution to the sudden stranger s store of experience beyond this dishonourable fringe upon the old town s jowl rose a dense mass of trees surmounting and filling a little hollow through this bickered a small stream that perished down the sheer and disconcerting side of the great canon of the rio bravo del norte in this sordid spot was condemned to remain for certain hours the impotent transport of the queen of the serpent tribe the front door of the car was open its forward end was curtained off into a small reception room here the admiring and propitiatory reporters were wont to sit and transpose the music of senorita alvarita s talk into the more florid key of the press a picture of abraham lincoln hung against a wall one of a cluster of school girls grouped upon stone steps was in another place a third was easter lilies in a blood red frame a neat carpet was under foot a pitcher sweating cold drops and a glass stood on a fragile stand in a willow rocker reading a newspaper sat alvarita spanish you would say andalusian or better still basque that compound like the diamond of darkness and fire hair the shade of purple grapes viewed at midnight eyes long dusky and disquieting with their untroubled directness of gaze face haughty and bold touched with a pretty insolence that gave it life to hasten conviction of her charm but glance at the stacks of handbills in the corner green and yellow and white upon them you see an incompetent presentment of the senorita in her professional garb and pose irresistible in black lace and yellow ribbons she faces you a blue racer is spiralled upon each bare arm coiled twice about her waist and once about her neck his horrid head close to hers you perceive kuku the great eleven foot asian python a hand drew aside the curtain that partitioned the car and a middle aged faded woman holding a knife and a half peeled potato looked in and said alviry are you right busy i m reading the home paper ma what do you think that pale tow headed matilda price got the most votes in the news for the prettiest girl in gallipo lees shush she wouldn t of done it if you d been home alviry lord knows i hope we ll be there before fall s over i m tired gallopin round the world playin we are dagoes and givin snake shows but that ain t what i wanted to say that there biggest snake s gone again i ve looked all over the car and can t find him he must have been gone an hour i remember hearin somethin rustlin along the floor but i thought it was you oh blame that old rascal exclaimed the queen throwing down her paper this is the third time he s got away george never will fasten down the lid to his box properly i do believe he s afraid of kuku now i ve got to go hunt him better hurry somebody might hurt him the queen s teeth showed in a gleaming contemptuous smile no danger when they see kuku outside they simply scoot away and buy bromides there s a crick over between here and the river that old scamp d swap his skin any time for a drink of running water i guess i ll find him there all right a few minutes later alvarita stopped upon the forward platform ready for her quest her handsome black skirt was shaped to the most recent proclamation of fashion her spotless shirt waist gladdened the eye in that desert of sunshine a swelling oasis cool and fresh a man s split straw hat sat firmly on her coiled abundant hair beneath her serene round impudent chin a man s four in hand tie was jauntily knotted about a man s high stiff collar a parasol she carried of white silk and its fringe was lace yellowly genuine i will grant gallipolis as to her costume but firmly to seville or valladolid i am held by her eyes castanets balconies mantillas serenades ambuscades escapades all these their dark depths guaranteed ain t you afraid to go out alone alviry queried the queen mother anxiously there s so many rough people about mebbe you d better i never saw anything i was afraid of yet ma specially people and men in particular don t you fret i ll trot along back as soon as i find that runaway scamp the dust lay thick upon the bare ground near the tracks alvarita s eye soon discovered the serrated trail of the escaped python it led across the depot grounds and away down a smaller street in the direction of the little canon as predicted by her a stillness and lack of excitement in the neighbourhood encouraged the hope that as yet the inhabitants were unaware that so formidable a guest traversed their highways the heat had driven them indoors whence outdrifted occasional shrill laughs or the depressing whine of a maltreated concertina in the shade a few mexican children like vivified stolid idols in clay stared from their play vision struck and silent as alvarita came and went here and there a woman peeped from a door and stood dumb reduced to silence by the aspect of the white silk parasol a hundred yards and the limits of the town were passed scattered chaparral succeeding and then a noble grove overflowing the bijou canon through this a small bright stream meandered park like it was with a kind of cockney ruralness further endorsed by the waste papers and rifled tins of picnickers up this stream and down it among its pseudo sylvan glades and depressions wandered the bright and unruffled alvarita once she saw evidence of the recreant reptile s progress in his distinctive trail across a spread of fine sand in the arroyo the living water was bound to lure him he could not be far away so sure was she of his immediate proximity that she perched herself to idle for a time in the curve of a great creeper that looped down from a giant water elm to reach this she climbed from the pathway a little distance up the side of a steep and rugged incline around her chaparral grew thick and high a late blooming ratama tree dispensed from its yellow petals a sweet and persistent odour adown the ravine rustled a seductive wind melancholy with the taste of sodden fallen leaves alvarita removed her hat and undoing the oppressive convolutions of her hair began to slowly arrange it in two long dusky plaits from the obscure depths of a thick clump of evergreen shrubs five feet away two small jewel bright eyes were steadfastly regarding her coiled there lay kuku the great python kuku the magnificent he of the plated muzzle the grooved lips the eleven foot stretch of elegantly and brilliantly mottled skin the great python was viewing his mistress without a sound or motion to disclose his presence perhaps the splendid truant forefelt his capture but screened by the foliage thought to prolong the delight of his escapade what pleasure it was after the hot and dusty car to lie thus smelling the running water and feeling the agreeable roughness of the earth and stones against his body soon very soon the queen would find him and he powerless as a worm in her audacious hands would be returned to the dark chest in the narrow house that ran on wheels alvarita heard a sudden crunching of the gravel below her turning her head she saw a big swarthy mexican with a daring and evil expression contemplating her with an ominous dull eye what do you want she asked as sharply as five hairpins between her lips would permit continuing to plait her hair and looking him over with placid contempt the mexican continued to gaze at her and showed his teeth in a white jagged smile i no hurt y you senorita he said you bet you won t answered the queen shaking back one finished massive plait but don t you think you d better move on not hurt y you no but maybeso take one beso one li l kees you call him the man smiled again and set his foot to ascend the slope alvarita leaned swiftly and picked up a stone the size of a cocoanut vamoose quick she ordered peremptorily you coon the red of insult burned through the mexican s dark skin hidalgo yo he shot between his fangs i am not neg r ro diabla bonita for that you shall pay me he made two quick upward steps this time but the stone hurled by no weak arm struck him square in the chest he staggered back to the footway swerved half around and met another sight that drove all thoughts of the girl from his head she turned her eyes to see what had diverted his interest a man with red brown curling hair and a melancholy sunburned smooth shaven face was coming up the path twenty yards away around the mexican s waist was buckled a pistol belt with two empty holsters he had laid aside his sixes possibly in the jacal of the fair pancha and had forgotten them when the passing of the fairer alvarita had enticed him to her trail his hands now flew instinctively to the holsters but finding the weapons gone he spread his fingers outward with the eloquent abjuring deprecating latin gesture and stood like a rock seeing his plight the newcomer unbuckled his own belt containing two revolvers threw it upon the ground and continued to advance splendid murmured alvarita with flashing eyes as bob buckley according to the mad code of bravery that his sensitive conscience imposed upon his cowardly nerves abandoned his guns and closed in upon his enemy the old inevitable nausea of abject fear wrung him his breath whistled through his constricted air passages his feet seemed like lumps of lead his mouth was dry as dust his heart congested with blood hurt his ribs as it thumped against them the hot june day turned to moist november and still he advanced spurred by a mandatory pride that strained its uttermost against his weakling flesh the distance between the two men slowly lessened the mexican stood immovable waiting when scarce five yards separated them a little shower of loosened gravel rattled down from above to the ranger s feet he glanced upward with instinctive caution a pair of dark eyes brilliantly soft and fierily tender encountered and held his own the most fearful heart and the boldest one in all the rio bravo country exchanged a silent and inscrutable communication alvarita still seated within her vine leaned forward above the breast high chaparral one hand was laid across her bosom one great dark braid curved forward over her shoulder her lips were parted her face was lit with what seemed but wonder great and absolute wonder her eyes lingered upon buckley s let no one ask or presume to tell through what subtle medium the miracle was performed as by a lightning flash two clouds will accomplish counterpoise and compensation of electric surcharge so on that eyeglance the man received his complement of manhood and the maid conceded what enriched her womanly grace by its loss the mexican suddenly stirring ventilated his attitude of apathetic waiting by conjuring swiftly from his bootleg a long knife buckley cast aside his hat and laughed once aloud like a happy school boy at a frolic then empty handed he sprang nimbly and garcia met him without default so soon was the engagement ended that disappointment imposed upon the ranger s warlike ecstasy instead of dealing the traditional downward stroke the mexican lunged straight with his knife buckley took the precarious chance and caught his wrist fair and firm then he delivered the good saxon knock out blow always so pathetically disastrous to the fistless latin races and garcia was down and out with his head under a clump of prickly pears the ranger looked up again to the queen of the serpents alvarita scrambled down to the path i m mighty glad i happened along when i did said the ranger he he frightened me so cooed alvarita they did not hear the long low hiss of the python under the shrubs wiliest of the beasts no doubt he was expressing the humiliation he felt at having so long dwelt in subjection to this trembling and colouring mistress of his whom he had deemed so strong and potent and fearsome then came galloping to the spot the civic authorities and to them the ranger awarded the prostrate disturber of the peace whom they bore away limply across the saddle of one of their mounts but buckley and alvarita lingered slowly slowly they walked the ranger regained his belt of weapons with a fine timidity she begged the indulgence of fingering the great s with little ohs and ahs of new born delicious shyness the canoncito was growing dusky beyond its terminus in the river bluff they could see the outer world yet suffused with the waning glory of sunset a scream a piercing scream of fright from alvarita back she cowered and the ready protecting arm of buckley formed her refuge what terror so dire as to thus beset the close of the reign of the never before daunted queen across the path there crawled a caterpillar a horrid fuzzy two inch caterpillar truly kuku thou went avenged thus abdicated the queen of the serpent tribe viva la reina the higher abdication curly the tramp sidled toward the free lunch counter he caught a fleeting glance from the bartender s eye and stood still trying to look like a business man who had just dined at the menger and was waiting for a friend who had promised to pick him up in his motor car curly s histrionic powers were equal to the impersonation but his make up was wanting the bartender rounded the bar in a casual way looking up at the ceiling as though he was pondering some intricate problem of kalsomining and then fell upon curly so suddenly that the roadster had no excuses ready irresistibly but so composedly that it seemed almost absendmindedness on his part the dispenser of drinks pushed curly to the swinging doors and kicked him out with a nonchalance that almost amounted to sadness that was the way of the southwest curly arose from the gutter leisurely he felt no anger or resentment toward his ejector fifteen years of tramphood spent out of the twenty two years of his life had hardened the fibres of his spirit the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune fell blunted from the buckler of his armoured pride with especial resignation did he suffer contumely and injury at the hands of bartenders naturally they were his enemies and unnaturally they were often his friends he had to take his chances with them but he had not yet learned to estimate these cool languid southwestern knights of the bungstarter who had the manners of an earl of pawtucket and who when they disapproved of your presence moved you with the silence and despatch of a chess automaton advancing a pawn curly stood for a few moments in the narrow mesquite paved street san antonio puzzled and disturbed him three days he had been a non paying guest of the town having dropped off there from a box car of an i g n freight because greaser johnny had told him in des moines that the alamo city was manna fallen gathered cooked and served free with cream and sugar curly had found the tip partly a good one there was hospitality in plenty of a careless liberal irregular sort but the town itself was a weight upon his spirits after his experience with the rushing business like systematised cities of the north and east here he was often flung a dollar but too frequently a good natured kick would follow it once a band of hilarious cowboys had roped him on military plaza and dragged him across the black soil until no respectable rag bag would have stood sponsor for his clothes the winding doubling streets leading nowhere bewildered him and then there was a little river crooked as a pot hook that crawled through the middle of the town crossed by a hundred little bridges so nearly alike that they got on curly s nerves and the last bartender wore a number nine shoe the saloon stood on a corner the hour was eight o clock homefarers and outgoers jostled curly on the narrow stone sidewalk between the buildings to his left he looked down a cleft that proclaimed itself another thoroughfare the alley was dark except for one patch of light where there was light there were sure to be human beings where there were human beings after nightfall in san antonio there might be food and there was sure to be drink so curly headed for the light the illumination came from schwegel s cafe on the sidewalk in front of it curly picked up an old envelope it might have contained a check for a million it was empty but the wanderer read the address mr otto schwegel and the name of the town and state the postmark was detroit curly entered the saloon and now in the light it could be perceived that he bore the stamp of many years of vagabondage he had none of the tidiness of the calculating and shrewd professional tramp his wardrobe represented the cast off specimens of half a dozen fashions and eras two factories had combined their efforts in providing shoes for his feet as you gazed at him there passed through your mind vague impressions of mummies wax figures russian exiles and men lost on desert islands his face was covered almost to his eyes with a curly brown beard that he kept trimmed short with a pocket knife and that had furnished him with his nom de route light blue eyes full of sullenness fear cunning impudence and fawning witnessed the stress that had been laid upon his soul the saloon was small and in its atmosphere the odours of meat and drink struggled for the ascendancy the pig and the cabbage wrestled with hydrogen and oxygen behind the bar schwegel laboured with an assistant whose epidermal pores showed no signs of being obstructed hot weinerwurst and sauerkraut were being served to purchasers of beer curly shuffled to the end of the bar coughed hollowly and told schwegel that he was a detroit cabinet maker out of a job it followed as the night the day that he got his schooner and lunch was you acquainted maybe with heinrich strauss in detroit asked schwegel did i know heinrich strauss repeated curly affectionately why say bo i wish i had a dollar for every game of pinochle me and heine has played on sunday afternoons more beer and a second plate of steaming food was set before the diplomat and then curly knowing to a fluid drachm how far a con game would go shuffled out into the unpromising street and now he began to perceive the inconveniences of this stony southern town there was none of the outdoor gaiety and brilliancy and music that provided distraction even to the poorest in the cities of the north here even so early the gloomy rock walled houses were closed and barred against the murky dampness of the night the streets were mere fissures through which flowed grey wreaths of river mist as he walked he heard laughter and the chink of coin and chips behind darkened windows and music coming from every chink of wood and stone but the diversions were selfish the day of popular pastimes had not yet come to san antonio but at length curly as he strayed turned the sharp angle of another lost street and came upon a rollicking band of stockmen from the outlying ranches celebrating in the open in front of an ancient wooden hotel one great roisterer from the sheep country who had just instigated a movement toward the bar swept curly in like a stray goat with the rest of his flock the princes of kine and wool hailed him as a new zoological discovery and uproariously strove to preserve him in the diluted alcohol of their compliments and regards an hour afterward curly staggered from the hotel barroom dismissed by his fickle friends whose interest in him had subsided as quickly as it had risen full stoked with alcoholic fuel and cargoed with food the only question remaining to disturb him was that of shelter and bed a drizzling cold texas rain had begun to fall an endless lazy unintermittent downfall that lowered the spirits of men and raised a reluctant steam from the warm stones of the streets and houses thus comes the norther dousing gentle spring and amiable autumn with the chilling salutes and adieux of coming and departing winter curly followed his nose down the first tortuous street into which his irresponsible feet conducted him at the lower end of it on the bank of the serpentine stream he perceived an open gate in a cemented rock wall inside he saw camp fires and a row of low wooden sheds built against three sides of the enclosing wall he entered the enclosure under the sheds many horses were champing at their oats and corn many wagons and buckboards stood about with their teams harness thrown carelessly upon the shafts and doubletrees curly recognised the place as a wagon yard such as is provided by merchants for their out of town friends and customers no one was in sight no doubt the drivers of those wagons were scattered about the town seeing the elephant and hearing the owl in their haste to become patrons of the town s dispensaries of mirth and good cheer the last ones to depart must have left the great wooden gate swinging open curly had satisfied the hunger of an anaconda and the thirst of a camel so he was neither in the mood nor the condition of an explorer he zigzagged his way to the first wagon that his eyesight distinguished in the semi darkness under the shed it was a two horse wagon with a top of white canvas the wagon was half filled with loose piles of wool sacks two or three great bundles of grey blankets and a number of bales bundles and boxes a reasoning eye would have estimated the load at once as ranch supplies bound on the morrow for some outlying hacienda but to the drowsy intelligence of curly they represented only warmth and softness and protection against the cold humidity of the night after several unlucky efforts at last he conquered gravity so far as to climb over a wheel and pitch forward upon the best and warmest bed he had fallen upon in many a day then he became instinctively a burrowing animal and dug his way like a prairie dog down among the sacks and blankets hiding himself from the cold air as snug and safe as a bear in his den for three nights sleep had visited curly only in broken and shivering doses so now when morpheus condescended to pay him a call curly got such a strangle hold on the mythological old gentleman that it was a wonder that anyone else in the whole world got a wink of sleep that night six cowpunchers of the cibolo ranch were waiting around the door of the ranch store their ponies cropped grass near by tied in the texas fashion which is not tied at all their bridle reins had been dropped to the earth which is a more effectual way of securing them such is the power of habit and imagination than you could devise out of a half inch rope and a live oak tree these guardians of the cow lounged about each with a brown cigarette paper in his hand and gently but unceasingly cursed sam revell the storekeeper sam stood in the door snapping the red elastic bands on his pink madras shirtsleeves and looking down affectionately at the only pair of tan shoes within a forty mile radius his offence had been serious and he was divided between humble apology and admiration for the beauty of his raiment he had allowed the ranch stock of smoking to become exhausted i thought sure there was another case of it under the counter boys he explained but it happened to be catterdges you ve sure got a case of happenedicitis said poky rodgers fency rider of the largo verde potrero somebody ought to happen to give you a knock on the head with the butt end of a quirt i ve rode in nine miles for some tobacco and it don t appear natural and seemly that you ought to be allowed to live the boys was smokin cut plug and dried mesquite leaves mixed when i left sighed mustang taylor horse wrangler of the three elm camp they ll be lookin for me back by nine they ll be settin up with their papers ready to roll a whiff of the real thing before bedtime and i ve got to tell em that this pink eyed sheep headed sulphur footed shirt waisted son of a calico broncho sam revell hasn t got no tobacco on hand gregorio falcon mexican vaquero and best thrower of the rope on the cibolo pushed his heavy silver embroidered straw sombrero back upon his thicket of jet black curls and scraped the bottoms of his pockets for a few crumbs of the precious weed ah don samuel he said reproachfully but with his touch of castilian manners escuse me dthey say dthe jackrabbeet and dthe sheep have dthe most leetle sesos how you call dthem brain es ah don t believe dthat don samuel escuse me ah

a red and yellow handkerchief ranse took the order for some more smokin to san antone with him tuesday pancho rode ranse s hoss back yesterday and ranse is goin to drive the wagon back himself there wa n t much of a load just some woolsacks and blankets and nails and canned peaches and a few things we was out of i look for ranse to roll in to day sure he s an early starter and a hell to split driver and he ought to be here not far from sundown what plugs is he drivin asked mustang taylor with a smack of hope in his tones the buckboard greys said sam i ll wait a spell then said the wrangler them plugs eat up a trail like a road runner swallowin a whip snake and you may bust me open a can of greengage plums sam while i m waitin for somethin better open me some yellow clings ordered poky rodgers i ll wait too the tobaccoless punchers arranged themselves comfortably on the steps of the store inside sam chopped open with a hatchet the tops of the cans of fruit the store a big white wooden building like a barn stood fifty yards from the ranch house beyond it were the horse corrals and still farther the wool sheds and the brush topped shearing pens for the rancho cibolo raised both cattle and sheep behind the store at a little distance were the grass thatched jacals of the mexicans who bestowed their allegiance upon the cibolo the ranch house was composed of four large rooms with plastered adobe walls and a two room wooden ell a twenty feet wide gallery circumvented the structure it was set in a grove of immense live oaks and water elms near a lake a long not very wide and tremendously deep lake in which at nightfall great gars leaped to the surface and plunged with the noise of hippopotamuses frolicking at their bath from the trees hung garlands and massive pendants of the melancholy grey moss of the south indeed the cibolo ranch house seemed more of the south than of the west it looked as if old kiowa truesdell might have brought it with him from the lowlands of mississippi when he came to texas with his rifle in the hollow of his arm in but though he did not bring the family mansion truesdell did bring something in the way of a family inheritance that was more lasting than brick or stone he brought one end of the truesdell curtis family feud and when a curtis bought the rancho de los olmos sixteen miles from the cibolo there were lively times on the pear flats and in the chaparral thickets off the southwest in those days truesdell cleaned the brush of many a wolf and tiger cat and mexican lion and one or two curtises fell heirs to notches on his rifle stock also he buried a brother with a curtis bullet in him on the bank of the lake at cibolo and then the kiowa indians made their last raid upon the ranches between the frio and the rio grande and truesdell at the head of his rangers rid the earth of them to the last brave earning his sobriquet then came prosperity in the form of waxing herds and broadening lands and then old age and bitterness when he sat with his great mane of hair as white as the spanish dagger blossoms and his fierce pale blue eyes on the shaded gallery at cibolo growling like the pumas that he had slain he snapped his fingers at old age the bitter taste to life did not come from that the cup that stuck at his lips was that his only son ransom wanted to marry a curtis the last youthful survivor of the other end of the feud for a while the only sounds to be heard at the store were the rattling of the tin spoons and the gurgling intake of the juicy fruits by the cowpunchers the stamping of the grazing ponies and the singing of a doleful song by sam as he contentedly brushed his stiff auburn hair for the twentieth time that day before a crinkly mirror from the door of the store could be seen the irregular sloping stretch of prairie to the south with its reaches of light green billowy mesquite flats in the lower places and its rises crowned with nearly black masses of short chaparral through the mesquite flat wound the ranch road that five miles away flowed into the old government trail to san antonio the sun was so low that the gentlest elevation cast its grey shadow miles into the green gold sea of sunshine that evening ears were quicker than eyes the mexican held up a tawny finger to still the scraping of tin against tin one waggeen said he cross dthe arroyo hondo ah hear dthe wheel verree rockee place dthe hondo you ve got good ears gregorio said mustang taylor i never heard nothin but the song bird in the bush and the zephyr skallyhootin across the peaceful dell in ten minutes taylor remarked i see the dust of a wagon risin right above the fur end of the flat you have verree good eyes senor said gregorio smiling two miles away they saw a faint cloud dimming the green ripples of the mesquites in twenty minutes they heard the clatter of the horses hoofs in five minutes more the grey plugs dashed out of the thicket whickering for oats and drawing the light wagon behind them like a toy from the jacals came a cry of el amo el amo four mexican youths raced to unharness the greys the cowpunchers gave a yell of greeting and delight ranse truesdell driving threw the reins to the ground and laughed it s under the wagon sheet boys he said i know what you re waiting for if sam lets it run out again we ll use those yellow shoes of his for a target there s two cases pull em out and light up i know you all want a smoke after striking dry country ranse had removed the wagon sheet from the bows and thrown it over the goods in the wagon six pair of hasty hands dragged it off and grabbled beneath the sacks and blankets for the cases of tobacco long collins tobacco messenger from the san gabriel outfit who rode with the longest stirrups west of the mississippi delved with an arm like the tongue of a wagon he caught something harder than a blanket and pulled out a fearful thing a shapeless muddy bunch of leather tied together with wire and twine from its ragged end like the head and claws of a disturbed turtle protruded human toes who ee yelled long collins ranse are you a packin around of corpuses here s a howlin grasshoppers up from his long slumber popped curly like some vile worm from its burrow he clawed his way out and sat blinking like a disreputable drunken owl his face was as bluish red and puffed and seamed and cross lined as the cheapest round steak of the butcher his eyes were swollen slits his nose a pickled beet his hair would have made the wildest thatch of a jack in the box look like the satin poll of a cleo de merode the rest of him was scarecrow done to the life ranse jumped down from his seat and looked at his strange cargo with wide open eyes here you maverick what are you doing in my wagon how did you get in there the punchers gathered around in delight for the time they had forgotten tobacco curly looked around him slowly in every direction he snarled like a scotch terrier through his ragged beard where is this he rasped through his parched throat it s a damn farm in an old field what d you bring me here for say did i say i wanted to come here what are you reubs rubberin at hey g wan or i ll punch some of yer faces drag him out collins said ranse curly took a slide and felt the ground rise up and collide with his shoulder blades he got up and sat on the steps of the store shivering from outraged nerves hugging his knees and sneering taylor lifted out a case of tobacco and wrenched off its top six cigarettes began to glow bringing peace and forgiveness to sam how d you come in my wagon repeated ranse this time in a voice that drew a reply curly recognised the tone he had heard it used by freight brakemen and large persons in blue carrying clubs me he growled oh was you talkin to me why i was on my way to the menger but my valet had forgot to pack my pyjamas so i crawled into that wagon in the wagon yard see i never told you to bring me out to this bloomin farm see what is

grounds of nights i don t know if it bites no it ain t mustang volunteered long collins them galliwampuses has fins on their backs and eighteen toes this here is a hicklesnifter it lives under the ground and eats cherries don t stand so close to it it wipes out villages with one stroke of its prehensile tail sam the cosmopolite who called bartenders in san antone by their first name stood in the door he was a better zoologist well ain t that a willie for your whiskers he commented where d you dig up the hobo ranse goin to make an auditorium for inbreviates out of the ranch say said curly from whose panoplied breast all shafts of wit fell blunted any of you kiddin guys got a drink on you have your fun say i ve been hittin the stuff till i don t know straight up he turned to ranse say you shanghaied me on your d d old prairie schooner did i tell you to drive me to a farm i want a drink i m goin all to little pieces what s doin ranse saw that the tramp s nerves were racking him he despatched one of the mexican boys to the ranch house for a glass of whisky curly gulped it down and into his eyes came a brief grateful glow as human as the expression in the eye of a faithful setter dog thanky boss he said quietly you re thirty miles from a railroad and forty miles from a saloon said ranse curly fell back weakly against the steps since you are here continued the ranchman come along with me we can t turn you out on the prairie a rabbit might tear you to pieces he conducted curly to a large shed where the ranch vehicles were kept there he spread out a canvas cot and brought blankets i don t suppose you can sleep said ranse since you ve been pounding your ear for twenty four hours but you can camp here till morning i ll have pedro fetch you up some grub sleep said curly i can sleep a week say sport have you got a coffin nail on you fifty miles had ransom truesdell driven that day and yet this is what he did old kiowa truesdell sat in his great wicker chair reading by the light of an immense oil lamp ranse laid a bundle of newspapers fresh from town at his elbow back ranse said the old man looking up son old kiowa continued i ve been thinking all day about a certain matter that we have talked about i want you to tell me again i ve lived for you i ve fought wolves and indians and worse white men to protect you you never had any mother that you can remember

slowly as i am a truesdell and as you are my father i ll never marry a curtis good boy said old kiowa you d better go get some supper ranse went to the kitchen at the rear of the house pedro the mexican cook sprang up to bring the food he was keeping warm in the stove just a cup of coffee pedro he said and drank it standing and then there s a tramp on a cot in the wagon shed take him something to eat better make it enough for two ranse walked out toward the jacals a boy came running manuel can you catch vaminos in the little pasture for me why not senor i saw him near the puerta but two hours past he bears a drag rope get him and saddle him as quick as you can prontito senor soon mounted on vaminos ranse leaned in the saddle pressed with his knees and galloped eastward past the store where sat sam trying his guitar in the moonlight vaminos shall have a word vaminos the good dun horse the mexicans who have a hundred names for the colours of a horse called him gruyo he was a mouse coloured slate coloured flea bitten roan dun if you can conceive it down his back from his mane to his tail went a line of black he would live forever and surveyors have not laid off as many miles in the world as he could travel in a day eight miles east of the cibolo ranch house ranse loosened the pressure of his knees and vaminos stopped under a big ratama tree the yellow ratama blossoms showered fragrance that would have undone the roses of france the moon made the earth a great concave bowl with a crystal sky for a lid in a glade five jack rabbits leaped and played together like kittens eight miles farther east shone a faint star that appeared to have dropped below the horizon night riders who often steered their course by it knew it to be the light in the rancho de los olmos in ten minutes yenna curtis galloped to the tree on her sorrel pony dancer the two leaned and clasped hands heartily i ought to have ridden nearer your home said ranse but you never will let me yenna laughed and in the soft light you could see her strong white teeth and fearless eyes no sentimentality there in spite of the moonlight the odour of the ratamas and the admirable figure of ranse truesdell the lover but she was there eight miles from her home to meet him how often have i told you ranse she said that i am your half way girl always half way well said ranse with a question in his tones i did said yenna with almost a sigh i told him after dinner when i thought he would be in a good humour did you ever wake up a lion ranse with the mistaken idea that he would be a kitten he almost tore the ranch to pieces it s all up i love my daddy ranse and i m afraid i m afraid of him too he ordered me to promise that i d never marry a truesdell i promised that s all what luck did you have the same said ranse slowly i promised him that his son would never marry a curtis somehow i couldn t go against him he s mighty old i m sorry yenna the girl leaned in her saddle and laid one hand on ranse s on the horn of his saddle i never thought i d like you better for giving me up she said ardently but i do i must ride back now ranse i slipped out of the house and saddled dancer myself good night neighbour good night said ranse ride carefully over them badger holes they wheeled and rode away in opposite directions yenna turned in her saddle and called clearly don t forget i m your half way girl ranse damn all family feuds and inherited scraps muttered ranse vindictively to the breeze as he rode back to the cibolo ranse turned his horse into the small pasture and went to his own room he opened the lowest drawer of an old bureau to get out the packet of letters that yenna had written him one summer when she had gone to mississippi for a visit the drawer stuck and he yanked at it savagely as a man will it came out of the bureau and bruised both his shins as a drawer will an old folded yellow letter without an envelope fell from somewhere probably from where it had lodged in one of the upper drawers ranse took it to the lamp and read it curiously then he took his hat and walked to one of the mexican jacals tia juana he said i would like to talk with you a while an old old mexican woman white haired and wonderfully wrinkled rose from a stool sit down said ranse removing his hat and taking the one chair in the jacal who am i tia juana he asked speaking spanish don ransom our good friend and employer why do you ask answered the old woman wonderingly tia juana who am i he repeated with his stern eyes looking into hers a frightened look came in the old woman s face she fumbled with her black shawl who am i tia juana said ranse once more thirty two years i have lived on the rancho cibolo said tia juana i thought to be buried under the coma mott beyond the garden before these things should be known close the door don ransom and i will speak i see in your face that you know an hour ranse spent behind tia juana s closed door as he was on his way back to the house curly called to him from the wagon shed the tramp sat on his cot swinging his feet and smoking say sport he grumbled this is no way to treat a man after kidnappin him i went up to the store and borrowed a razor from that fresh guy and had a shave but that ain t all a man needs say can t you loosen up for about three fingers more of that booze i never asked you to bring me to your d d farm stand up out here in the light said ranse looking at him closely curly got up sullenly and took a step or two his face now shaven smooth seemed transformed his hair had been combed and it fell back from the right side of his forehead with a peculiar wave the moonlight charitably softened the ravages of drink and his aquiline well shaped nose and small square cleft chin almost gave distinction to his looks ranse sat on the foot of the cot and looked at him curiously where did you come from have you got any home or folks anywhere me why i m a dook said curly i m sir reginald oh cheese it no i don t know anything about my ancestors i ve been a tramp ever since i can remember say old pal are you going to set em up again to night or not you answer my questions and maybe i will how did you come to be a tramp me answered curly why i adopted that profession when i was an infant case of had to first thing i can remember i belonged to a big lazy hobo called beefsteak charley he sent me around to houses to beg i wasn t hardly big enough to reach the latch of a gate did he ever tell you how he got you asked ranse once when he was sober he said he bought me for an old six shooter and six bits from a band of drunken mexican sheep shearers but what s the diff that s all i know all right said ranse i reckon you re a maverick for certain i m going to put the rancho cibolo brand on you i ll start you to work in one of the camps to morrow work sniffed curly disdainfully what do you take me for do you think i d chase cows and hop skip and jump around after crazy sheep like that pink and yellow guy at the store says these reubs do forget it oh you ll like it when you get used to it said ranse yes i ll send you up one more drink by pedro i think you ll make a first class cowpuncher before i get through with you me said curly i pity the cows you set me to chaperon they can go chase themselves don t forget my nightcap please boss ranse paid a visit to the store before going to the house sam rivell was taking off his tan shoes regretting and preparing for bed any of the boys from the san gabriel camp riding in early in the morning asked ranse long collins said sam briefly for the mail tell him said ranse to take that tramp out to camp with him and keep him till i get there curly was sitting on his blankets in the san gabriel camp cursing talentedly when ranse truesdell rode up and dismounted on the next afternoon the cowpunchers were ignoring the stray he was grimy with dust and black dirt his clothes were making their last stand in favour of the conventions ranse went up to buck rabb the camp boss and spoke briefly he s a plumb buzzard said buck he won t work and he s the low downest passel of inhumanity i ever see i didn t know what you wanted done with him ranse so i just let him set that seems to suit him he s been condemned to death by the boys a dozen times but i told em maybe you was savin him for the torture ranse took off his coat i ve got a hard job before me buck i reckon but it has to be done i ve got to make a man out of that thing that s what i ve come to camp for he went up to curly brother he said don t you think if you had a bath it would allow you to take a seat in the company of your fellow man with less injustice to the atmosphere run away farmer said curly sardonically willie will send for nursey when he feels like having his tub the charco or water hole was twelve yards away ranse took one of curly s ankles and dragged him like a sack of potatoes to the brink then with the strength and sleight of a hammer throw he hurled the offending member of society far into the lake curly crawled out and up the bank spluttering like a porpoise ranse met him with a piece of soap and a coarse towel in his hands go to the other end of the lake and use this he said buck will give you some dry clothes at the wagon the tramp obeyed without protest by the time supper was ready he had returned to camp he was hardly to be recognised in his new shirt and brown duck clothes ranse observed him out of the corner of his eye lordy i hope he ain t a coward he was saying to himself i hope he won t turn out to be a coward his doubts were soon allayed curly walked straight to where he stood his light blue eyes were blazing now i m clean he said meaningly maybe you ll talk to me think you ve got a picnic here do you you clodhoppers think you can run over a man because you know he can t get away all right now what do you think of that curly planted a stinging slap against ranse s left cheek the print of his hand stood out a dull red against the tan ranse smiled happily the cowpunchers talk to this day of the battle that followed somewhere in his restless tour of the cities curly had acquired the art of self defence the ranchman was equipped only with the splendid strength and equilibrium of perfect health and the endurance conferred by decent living the two attributes nearly matched there were no formal rounds at last the fibre of the clean liver prevailed the last time curly went down from one of the ranchman s awkward but powerful blows he remained on the grass but looking up with an unquenched eye ranse went to the water barrel and washed the red from a cut on his chin in the stream from the faucet on his face was a grin of satisfaction much benefit might accrue to educators and moralists if they could know the details of the curriculum of reclamation through which ranse put his waif during the month that he spent in the san gabriel camp the ranchman had no fine theories to work out perhaps his whole stock of pedagogy embraced only a knowledge of horse breaking and a belief in heredity the cowpunchers saw that their boss was trying to make a man out of the strange animal that he had sent among them and they tacitly organised themselves into a faculty of assistants but their system was their own curly s first lesson stuck he became on friendly and then on intimate terms with soap and water and the thing that pleased ranse most was that his subject held his ground at each successive higher step but the steps were sometimes far apart once he got at the quart bottle of whisky kept sacredly in the grub tent for rattlesnake bites and spent sixteen hours on the grass magnificently drunk but when he staggered to his feet his first move was to find his soap and towel and start for the charco and once when a treat came from the ranch in the form of a basket of fresh tomatoes and young onions curly devoured the entire consignment before the punchers reached the camp at supper time and then the punchers punished him in their own way for three days they did not speak to him except to reply to his own questions or remarks and they spoke with absolute and unfailing politeness they played tricks on one another they pounded one another hurtfully and affectionately they heaped upon one another s heads friendly curses and obloquy but they were polite to curly he saw it and it stung him as much as ranse hoped it would then came a night that brought a cold wet norther wilson the youngest of the outfit had lain in camp two days ill with fever when joe got up at daylight to begin breakfast he found curly sitting asleep against a wheel of the grub wagon with only a saddle blanket around him while curly s blankets were stretched over wilson to protect him from the rain and wind three nights after that curly rolled himself in his blanket and went to sleep then the other punchers rose up softly and began to make preparations ranse saw long collins tie a rope to the horn of a saddle others were getting out their six shooters boys said ranse i m much obliged i was hoping you would but i didn t like to ask half a dozen six shooters began to pop awful yells rent the air long collins galloped wildly across curly s bed dragging the saddle after him that was merely their way of gently awaking their victim then they hazed him for an hour carefully and ridiculously after the code of cow camps whenever he uttered protest they held him stretched over a roll of blankets and thrashed him woefully with a pair of leather leggings and all this meant that curly had won his spurs that he was receiving the puncher s accolade nevermore would they be polite to him but he would be their pardner and stirrup brother foot to foot when the fooling was ended all hands made a raid on joe s big coffee pot by the fire for a java nightcap ranse watched the new knight carefully to see if he understood and was worthy curly limped with his cup of coffee to a log and sat upon it long collins followed and sat by his side buck rabb went and sat at the other curly grinned and then ranse furnished curly with mounts and saddle and equipment and turned him over to buck rabb instructing him to finish the job three weeks later ranse rode from the ranch into rabb s camp which was then in snake valley the boys were saddling for the day s ride he sought out long collins among them how about that bronco he asked long collins grinned reach out your hand ranse truesdell he said and you ll touch him and you can shake his n too if you like for he s plumb white and there s none better in no camp ranse looked again at the clear faced bronzed smiling cowpuncher who stood at collins s side could that be curly he held out his hand and curly grasped it with the muscles of a bronco buster i want you at the ranch said ranse all right sport said curly heartily but i want to come back again say pal this is a dandy farm and i don t want any better fun than hustlin cows with this bunch of guys they re all to the merry merry at the cibolo ranch house they dismounted ranse bade curly wait at the door of the living room he walked inside old kiowa truesdell was reading at a table good morning mr truesdell said ranse the old man turned his white head quickly how is this he began why do you call me mr when he looked at ranse s face he stopped and the hand that held his newspaper shook slightly boy he said slowly how did you find it out it s all right said ranse with a smile i made tia juana tell me it was kind of by accident but it s all right you ve been like a son to me said old kiowa trembling tia juana told me all about it said ranse she told me how you adopted me when i was knee high to a puddle duck out of a wagon train of prospectors that was bound west and she told me how the kid your own kid you know got lost or was run away with and she said it was the same day that the sheep shearers got on a bender and left the ranch our boy strayed from the house when he was two years old said the old man and then along came those emigrant wagons with a youngster they didn t want and we took you i never intended you to know ranse we never heard of our boy again he s right outside unless i m mighty mistaken said ranse opening the door and beckoning curly walked in no one could have doubted the old man and the young had the same sweep of hair the same nose chin line of face and prominent light blue eyes old kiowa rose eagerly curly looked about the room curiously a puzzled expression came over his face he pointed to the wall opposite where s the tick tock he asked absent mindedly the clock cried old kiowa loudly the eight day clock used to stand there why he turned to ranse but ranse was not there already a hundred yards away vaminos the good flea bitten dun was bearing him eastward like a racer through dust and chaparral towards the rancho de los olmos cupid a la carte the dispositions of woman said jeff peters after various opinions on the subject had been advanced run regular to diversions what a woman wants is what you re out of she wants more of a thing when it s scarce she likes to have souvenirs of things that never happened she likes to be reminded of things she never heard of a one sided view of objects is disjointing to the female composition tis a misfortune of mine begotten by nature and travel continued jeff looking thoughtfully between his elevated feet at the grocery stove to look deeper into some subjects than most people do i ve breathed gasoline smoke talking to street crowds in nearly every town in the united states i ve held em spellbound with music oratory sleight of hand and prevarications while i ve sold em jewelry medicine soap hair tonic and junk of other nominations and during my travels as a matter of recreation and expiation i ve taken cognisance some of women it takes a man a lifetime to find out about one particular woman but if he puts in say ten years industrious and curious he can acquire the general rudiments of the sex one lesson i picked up was when i was working the west with a line of brazilian diamonds and a patent fire kindler just after my trip from savannah down through the cotton belt with dalby s anti explosive lamp oil powder twas when the oklahoma country was in first bloom guthrie was rising in the middle of it like a lump of self raising dough it was a boom town of the regular kind you stood in line to get a chance to wash your face if you ate over ten minutes you had a lodging bill added on if you slept on a plank at night they charged it to you as board the next morning by nature and doctrines i am addicted to the habit of discovering choice places wherein to feed so i looked around and found a proposition that exactly cut the mustard i found a restaurant tent just opened up by an outfit that had drifted in on the tail of the boom they had knocked together a box house where they lived and did the cooking and served the meals in a tent pitched against the side that tent was joyful with placards on it calculated to redeem the world worn pilgrim from the sinfulness of boarding houses and pick me up hotels try mother s home made biscuits what s the matter with our apple dumplings and hard sauce hot cakes and maple syrup like you ate when a boy our fried chicken never was heard to crow there was literature doomed to please the digestions of man i said to myself that mother s wandering boy should munch there that night and so it came to pass and there is where i contracted my case of mame dugan old man dugan was six feet by one of indiana loafer and he spent his time sitting on his shoulder blades in a rocking chair in the shanty memorialising the great corn crop failure of ma dugan did the cooking and mame waited on the table as soon as i saw mame i knew there was a mistake in the census reports there wasn t but one girl in the united states when you come to specifications it isn t easy she was about the size of an angel and she had eyes and ways about her when you come to the kind of a girl she was you ll find a belt of em reaching from the brooklyn bridge west as far as the courthouse in council bluffs ia they earn their own living in stores restaurants factories and offices they re chummy and honest and free and tender and sassy and they look life straight in the eye they ve met man face to face and discovered that he s a poor creature they ve dropped to it that the reports in the seaside library about his being a fairy prince lack confirmation mame was that sort she was full of life and fun and breezy she passed the repartee with the boarders quick as a wink you d have smothered laughing i am disinclined to make excavations into the insides of a personal affection i am glued to the theory that the diversions and discrepancies of the indisposition known as love should be as private a sentiment as a toothbrush tis my opinion that the biographies of the heart should be confined with the historical romances of the liver to the advertising pages of the magazines so you ll excuse the lack of an itemised bill of my feelings toward mame pretty soon i got a regular habit of dropping into the tent to eat at irregular times when there wasn t so many around mame would sail in with a smile in a black dress and white apron and say hello jeff why don t you come at mealtime want to see how much trouble you can be of course friedchickenbeefsteakporkchopshamandeggspotpie and so on she called me jeff but there was no significations attached designations was all she meant the front names of any of us she used as they came to hand i d eat about two meals before i left and string em out like a society spread where they changed plates and wives and josh one another festively between bites mame stood for it pleasant for it wasn t up to her to take any canvas off the tent by declining dollars just because they were whipped in after meal times it wasn t long until there was another fellow named ed collier got the between meals affliction and him and me put in bridges between breakfast and dinner and dinner and supper that made a three ringed circus of that tent and mame s turn as waiter a continuous performance that collier man was saturated with designs and contrivings he was in well boring or insurance or claim jumping or something i ve forgotten which he was a man well lubricated with gentility and his words were such as recommended you to his point of view so collier and me infested the grub tent with care and activity mame was level full of impartiality twas like a casino hand the way she dealt out her favours one to collier and one to me and one to the board and not a card up her sleeve me and collier naturally got acquainted and gravitated together some on the outside divested of his stratagems he seemed to be a pleasant chap full of an amiable sort of hostility i notice you have an affinity for grubbing in the banquet hall after the guests have fled says i to him one day to draw his conclusions well yes says collier reflecting the tumult of a crowded board seems to harass my sensitive nerves it exasperates mine some too says i nice little girl don t you think i see says collier laughing well now that you mention it i have noticed that she doesn t seem to displease the optic nerve she s a joy to mine says i and i m going after her notice is hereby served i ll be as candid as you admits collier and if the drug stores don t run out of pepsin i ll give you a run for your money that ll leave you a dyspeptic at the wind up so collier and me begins the race the grub department lays in new supplies mame waits on us jolly and kind and agreeable and it looks like an even break with cupid and the cook working overtime in dugan s restaurant twas one night in september when i got mame to take a walk after supper when the things were all cleared away we strolled out a distance and sat on a pile of lumber at the edge of town such opportunities was seldom so i spoke my piece explaining how the brazilian diamonds and the fire kindler were laying up sufficient treasure to guarantee the happiness of two and that both of em together couldn t equal the light from somebody s eyes and that the name of dugan should be changed to peters or reasons why not would be in order mame didn t say anything right away directly she gave a kind of shudder and i began to learn something jeff she says i m sorry you spoke i like you as well as any of them but there isn t a man in the world i d ever marry and there never will be do you know what a man is in my eye he s a tomb he s a sarcophagus for the interment of beafsteakporkchopsliver nbaconham andeggs he s that and nothing more for two years i ve watched men eat eat eat until they represent nothing on earth to me but ruminant bipeds they re absolutely nothing but something that goes in front of a knife and fork and plate at the table they re fixed that way in my mind and memory i ve tried to overcome it but i can t i ve heard girls rave about their sweethearts but i never could understand it a man and a sausage grinder and a pantry awake in me exactly the same sentiments i went to a matinee once to see an actor the girls were crazy about i got interested enough to wonder whether he liked his steak rare medium or well done and his eggs over or straight up that was all no jeff i ll marry no man and see him sit at the breakfast table and eat and come back to dinner and eat and happen in again at supper to eat eat eat but mame says i it ll wear off you ve had too much of it you ll marry some time of course men don t eat always as far as my observation goes they do no i ll tell you what i m going to do mame turns sudden to animation and bright eyes there s a girl named susie foster in terre haute a chum of mine she waits in the railroad eating house there i worked two years in a restaurant in that town susie has it worse than i do because the men who eat at railroad stations gobble they try to flirt and gobble at the same time whew susie and i have it all planned out we re saving our money and when we get enough we re going to buy a little cottage and five acres we know of and live together and grow violets for the eastern market a man better not bring his appetite within a mile of that ranch don t girls ever i commenced but mame heads me off sharp no they don t they nibble a little bit sometimes that s all i thought the confect for goodness sake change the subject says mame as i said before that experience puts me wise that the feminine arrangement ever struggles after deceptions and illusions take england beef made her wieners elevated germany uncle sam owes his greatness to fried chicken and pie but the young ladies of the shetalkyou schools they ll never believe it shakespeare they allow and rubinstein and the rough riders is what did the trick twas a situation calculated to disturb i couldn t bear to give up mame and yet it pained me to think of abandoning the practice of eating i had acquired the habit too early for twenty seven years i had been blindly rushing upon my fate yielding to the insidious lures of that deadly monster food it was too late i was a ruminant biped for keeps it was lobster salad to a doughnut that my life was going to be blighted by it i continued to board at the dugan tent hoping that mame would relent i had sufficient faith in true love to believe that since it has often outlived the absence of a square meal it might in time overcome the presence of one i went on ministering to my fatal vice although i felt that each time i shoved a potato into my mouth in mame s presence i might be burying my fondest hopes i think collier must have spoken to mame and got the same answer for one day he orders a cup of coffee and a cracker and sits nibbling the corner of it like a girl in the parlour that s filled up in the kitchen previous on cold roast and fried cabbage i caught on and did the same and maybe we thought we d made a hit the next day we tried it again and out comes old man dugan fetching in his hands the fairy viands kinder off yer feed ain t ye gents he asks fatherly and some sardonic thought i d spell mame a bit seein the work was light and my rheumatiz can stand the strain so back me and collier had to drop to the heavy grub again i noticed about that time that i was seized by a most uncommon and devastating appetite i ate until mame must have hated to see me darken the door afterward i found out that i had been made the victim of the first dark and irreligious trick played on me by ed collier him and me had been taking drinks together uptown regular trying to drown our thirst for food that man had bribed about ten bartenders to always put a big slug of appletree s anaconda appetite bitters in every one of my drinks but the last trick he played me was hardest to forget one day collier failed to show up at the tent a man told me he left town that morning my only rival now was the bill of fare a few days before he left collier had presented me with a two gallon jug of fine whisky which he said a cousin had sent him from kentucky i now have reason to believe that it contained appletree s anaconda appetite bitters almost exclusively i continued to devour tons of provisions in mame s eyes i remained a mere biped more ruminant than ever about a week after collier pulled his freight there came a kind of side show to town and hoisted a tent near the railroad i judged it was a sort of fake museum and curiosity business i called to see mame one night and ma dugan said that she and thomas her younger brother had gone to the show that same thing happened for three nights that week saturday night i caught her on the way coming back and got to sit on the steps a while and talk to her i noticed she looked different her eyes were softer and shiny like instead of a mame dugan to fly from the voracity of man and raise violets she seemed to be a mame more in line as god intended her approachable and suited to bask in the light of the brazilians and the kindler you seem to be right smart inveigled says i with the unparalleled exhibition of the world s living curiosities and wonders it s a change says mame you ll need another says i if you keep on going every night don t be cross jeff says she it takes my mind off business don t the curiosities eat i ask not all of them some of them are wax look out then that you don t get stuck says i kind of flip and foolish mame blushed i didn t know what to think about her my hopes raised some that perhaps my attentions had palliated man s awful crime of visibly introducing nourishment into his system she talked some about the stars referring to them with respect and politeness and i drivelled a quantity about united hearts homes made bright by true affection and the kindler mame listened without scorn and i says to myself jeff old man you re removing the hoodoo that has clung to the consumer of victuals you re setting your heel upon the serpent that lurks in the gravy bowl monday night i drop around mame is at the unparalleled exhibition with thomas now may the curse of the forty one seven sided sea cooks says i and the bad luck of the nine impenitent grasshoppers rest upon this self same sideshow at once and forever more amen i ll go to see it myself to morrow night and investigate its baleful charm shall man that was made to inherit the earth be bereft of his sweetheart first by a knife and fork and then by a ten cent circus the next night before starting out for the exhibition tent i inquire and find out that mame is not at home she is not at the circus with thomas this time for thomas waylays me in the grass outside of the grub tent with a scheme of his own before i had time to eat supper what ll you give me jeff says he if i tell you something the value of it son i says sis is stuck on a freak says thomas one of the side show freaks i don t like him she does i overheard em talking thought maybe you d like to know say jeff does it put you wise two dollars worth there s a target rifle up town that i frisked my pockets and commenced to dribble a stream of halves and quarters into thomas s hat the information was of the pile driver system of news and it telescoped my intellects for a while while i was leaking small change and smiling foolish on the outside and suffering disturbances internally i was saying idiotically and pleasantly thank you thomas thank you er a freak you said thomas now could you make out the monstrosity s entitlements a little clearer if you please thomas this is the fellow says thomas pulling out a yellow handbill from his pocket and shoving it under my nose he s the champion faster of the universe i guess that s why sis got soft on him he don t eat nothing he s going to fast forty nine days this is the sixth that s him i looked at the name thomas pointed out professor eduardo collieri ah says i in admiration that s not so bad ed collier i give you credit for the trick but i don t give you the girl until she s mrs freak i hit the sod in the direction of the show i came up to the rear of the tent and as i did so a man wiggled out like a snake from under the bottom of the canvas scrambled to his feet and ran into me like a locoed bronco i gathered him by the neck and investigated him by the light of the stars it is professor eduardo collieri in human habiliments with a desperate look in one eye and impatience in the other hello curiosity says i get still a minute and let s have a look at your freakship how do you like being the willopus wallopus or the bim bam from borneo or whatever name you are denounced by in the side show business jeff peters says collier in a weak voice turn me loose or i ll slug you one i m in the extremest kind of a large hurry hands off tut tut eddie i answers holding him hard let an old friend gaze on the exhibition of your curiousness it s an eminent graft you fell onto my son but don t speak of assaults and battery because you re not fit the best you ve got is a lot of nerve and a mighty empty stomach and so it was the man was as weak as a vegetarian cat i d argue this case with you jeff says he regretful in his style for an unlimited number of rounds if i had half an hour to train in and a slab of beefsteak two feet square to train with curse the man i say that invented the art of going foodless may his soul in eternity be chained up within two feet of a bottomless pit of red hot hash i m abandoning the conflict jeff i m deserting to the enemy you ll find miss dugan inside contemplating the only living mummy and the informed hog she s a fine girl jeff i d have beat you out if i could have kept up the grubless habit a little while longer you ll have to admit that the fasting dodge was aces up for a while i figured it out that way but say jeff it s said that love makes the world go around let me tell you the announcement lacks verification it s the wind from the dinner horn that does it i love that mame dugan i ve gone six days without food in order to coincide with her sentiments only one bite did i have that was when i knocked the tattooed man down with a war club and got a sandwich he was gobbling the manager fined me all my salary but salary wasn t what i was after twas that girl i d give my life for her but i d endanger my immortal soul for a beef stew hunger is a horrible thing jeff love and business and family and religion and art and patriotism are nothing but shadows of words when a man s starving in such language ed collier discoursed to me pathetic i gathered the diagnosis that his affections and his digestions had been implicated in a scramble and the commissary had won out i never disliked ed collier i searched my internal admonitions of suitable etiquette to see if i could find a remark of a consoling nature but there was none convenient i d be glad now says ed if you ll let me go i ve been hard hit but i ll hit the ration supply harder i m going to clean out every restaurant in town i m going to wade waist deep in sirloins and swim in ham and eggs it s an awful thing jeff peters for a man to come to this pass to give up his girl for something to eat it s worse than that man esau that swapped his copyright for a partridge but then hunger s a fierce thing you ll excuse me now jeff for i smell a pervasion of ham frying in the distance and my legs are crying out to stampede in that direction a hearty meal to you ed collier i says to him and no hard feelings for myself i am projected to be an unseldom eater and i have condolence for your predicaments there was a sudden big whiff of frying ham smell on the breeze and the champion faster gives a snort and gallops off in the dark toward fodder i wish some of the cultured outfit that are always advertising the extenuating circumstances of love and romance had been there to see there was ed collier a fine man full of contrivances and flirtations abandoning the girl of his heart and ripping out into the contiguous territory in the pursuit of sordid grub twas a rebuke to the poets and a slap at the best paying element of fiction an empty stomach is a sure antidote to an overfull heart i was naturally anxious to know how far mame was infatuated with collier and his stratagems i went inside the unparalleled exhibition and there she was she looked surprised to see me but unguilty it s an elegant evening outside says i the coolness is quite nice and gratifying and the stars are lined out first class up where they belong wouldn t you shake these by products of the animal kingdom long enough to take a walk with a common human who never was on a programme in his life mame gave a sort of sly glance around and i knew what that meant oh says i i hate to tell you but the curiosity that lives on wind has flew the coop he just crawled out under the tent by this time he has amalgamated himself with half the delicatessen truck in town you mean ed collier says mame i do i answers and a pity it is that he has gone back to crime again i met him outside the tent and he exposed his intentions of devastating the food crop of the world tis enormously sad when one s ideal descends from his pedestal to make a seventeen year locust of himself mame looked me straight in the eye until she had corkscrewed my reflections jeff says she it isn t quite like you to talk that way i don t care to hear ed collier ridiculed a man may do ridiculous things but they don t look ridiculous to the girl he does em for that was one man in a hundred he stopped eating just to please me i d be hard hearted and ungrateful if i didn t feel kindly toward him could you do what he did i know says i seeing the point i m condemned i can t help it the brand of the consumer is upon my brow mrs eve settled that business for me when she made the dicker with the snake i fell from the fire into the frying pan i guess i m the champion feaster of the universe i spoke humble and mame mollified herself a little ed collier and i are good friends she said the same as me and you i gave him the same answer i did you no marrying for me i liked to be with ed and talk with him there was something mighty pleasant to me in the thought that here was a man who never used a knife and fork and all for my sake wasn t you in love with him i asks all injudicious wasn t there a deal on for you to become mrs curiosity all of us do it sometimes all of us get jostled out of the line of profitable talk now and then mame put on that little lemon glace smile that runs between ice and sugar and says much too pleasant you re short on credentials for asking that question mr peters suppose you do a forty nine day fast just to give you ground to stand on and then maybe i ll answer it so even after collier was kidnapped out of the way by the revolt of his appetite my own prospects with mame didn t seem to be improved and then business played out in guthrie i had stayed too long there the brazilians i had sold commenced to show signs of wear and the kindler refused to light up right frequent on wet mornings there is always a time in my business when the star of success says move on to the next town i was travelling by wagon at that time so as not to miss any of the small towns so i hitched up a few days later and went down to tell mame good bye i wasn t abandoning the game i intended running over to oklahoma city and work it for a week or two then i was coming back to institute fresh proceedings against mame what do i find at the dugans but mame all conspicuous in a blue travelling dress with her little trunk at the door it seems that sister lottie bell who is a typewriter in terre haute is going to be married next thursday and mame is off for a week s visit to be an accomplice at the ceremony mame is waiting for a freight wagon that is going to take her to oklahoma but i condemns the freight wagon with promptness and scorn and offers to deliver the goods myself ma dugan sees no reason why not as mr freighter wants pay for the job so thirty minutes later mame and i pull out in my light spring wagon with white canvas cover and head due south that morning was of a praiseworthy sort the breeze was lively and smelled excellent of flowers and grass and the little cottontail rabbits entertained themselves with skylarking across the road my two kentucky bays went for the horizon until it come sailing in so fast you wanted to dodge it like a clothesline mame was full of talk and rattled on like a kid about her old home and her school pranks and the things she liked and the hateful ways of those johnson girls just across the street way up in indiana not a word was said about ed collier or victuals or such solemn subjects about noon mame looks and finds that the lunch she had put up in a basket had been left behind i could have managed quite a collation but mame didn t seem to be grieving over nothing to eat so i made no lamentations it was a sore subject with me and i ruled provender in all its branches out of my conversation i am minded to touch light on explanations how i came to lose the way the road was dim and well grown with grass and there was mame by my side confiscating my intellects and attention the excuses are good or they are not as they may appear to you but i lost it and at dusk that afternoon when we should have been in oklahoma city we were seesawing along the edge of nowhere in some undiscovered river bottom and the rain was falling in large wet bunches down there in the swamps we saw a little log house on a small knoll of high ground the bottom grass and the chaparral and the lonesome timber crowded all around it it seemed to be a melancholy little house and you felt sorry for it twas that house for the night the way i reasoned it i explained to mame and she leaves it to me to decide she doesn t become galvanic and prosecuting as most women would but she says it s all right she knows i didn t mean to do it we found the house was deserted it had two empty rooms there was a little shed in the yard where beasts had once been kept in a loft of it was a lot of old hay i put my horses in there and gave them some of it for which they looked at me sorrowful expecting apologies the rest of the hay i carried into the house by armfuls with a view to accommodations i also brought in the patent kindler and the brazilians neither of which are guaranteed against the action of water mame and i sat on the wagon seats on the floor and i lit a lot of the kindler on the hearth for the night was chilly if i was any judge that girl enjoyed it it was a change for her it gave her a different point of view she laughed and talked and the kindler made a dim light compared to her eyes i had a pocketful of cigars and as far as i was concerned there had never been any fall of man we were at the same old stand in the garden of eden out there somewhere in the rain and the dark was the river of zion and the angel with the flaming sword had not yet put up the keep off the grass sign i opened up a gross or two of the brazilians and made mame put them on rings brooches necklaces eardrops bracelets girdles and lockets she flashed and sparkled like a million dollar princess until she had pink spots in her cheeks and almost cried for a looking glass when it got late i made a fine bunk on the floor for mame with the hay and my lap robes and blankets out of the wagon and persuaded her to lie down i sat in the other room burning tobacco and listening to the pouring rain and meditating on the many vicissitudes that came to a man during the seventy years or so immediately preceding his funeral i must have dozed a little while before morning for my eyes were shut and when i opened them it was daylight and there stood mame with her hair all done up neat and correct and her eyes bright with admiration of existence gee whiz jeff she exclaims but i m hungry i could eat a i looked up and caught her eye her smile went back in and she gave me a cold look of suspicion then i laughed and laid down on the floor to laugh easier it seemed funny to me by nature and geniality i am a hearty laugher and i went the limit when i came to mame was sitting with her back to me all contaminated with dignity don t be angry mame i says for i couldn t help it it s the funny way you ve done up your hair if you could only see it you needn t tell stories sir said mame cool and advised my hair is all right i know what you were laughing about why jeff look outside she winds up peeping through a chink between the logs i opened the little wooden window and looked out the entire river bottom was flooded and the knob of land on which the house stood was an island in the middle of a rushing stream of yellow water a hundred yards wide and it was still raining hard all we could do was to stay there till the doves brought in the olive branch i am bound to admit that conversations and amusements languished during that day i was aware that mame was getting a too prolonged one sided view of things again but i had no way to change it personally i was wrapped up in the desire to eat i had hallucinations of hash and visions of ham and i kept saying to myself all the time what ll you have to eat jeff what ll you order now old man when the waiter comes i picks out to myself all sorts of favourites from the bill of fare and imagines them coming i guess it s that way with all hungry men they can t get their cogitations trained on anything but something to eat it shows that the little table with the broken legged caster and the imitation worcester sauce and the napkin covering up the coffee stains is the paramount issue after all instead of the question of immortality or peace between nations i sat there musing along arguing with myself quite heated as to how i d have my steak with mushrooms or a la creole mame was on the other seat pensive her head leaning on her hand let the potatoes come home fried i states in my mind and brown the hash in the pan with nine poached eggs on the side i felt careful in my own pockets to see if i could find a peanut or a grain or two of popcorn night came on again with the river still rising and the rain still falling i looked at mame and i noticed that desperate look on her face that a girl always wears when she passes an ice cream lair i knew that poor girl was hungry maybe for the first time in her life there was that anxious look in her eye that a woman has only when she has missed a meal or feels her skirt coming unfastened in the back it was about eleven o clock or so on the second night when we sat gloomy in our shipwrecked cabin i kept jerking my mind away from the subject of food but it kept flopping back again before i could fasten it i thought of everything good to eat i had ever heard of i went away back to my kidhood and remembered the hot biscuit sopped in sorghum and bacon gravy with partiality and respect then i trailed along up the years pausing at green apples and salt flapjacks and maple lye hominy fried chicken old virginia style corn on the cob spareribs and sweet potato pie and wound up with georgia brunswick stew which is the top notch of good things to eat because it comprises em all they say a drowning man sees a panorama of his whole life pass before him well when a man s starving he sees the ghost of every meal he ever ate set out before him and he invents new dishes that would make the fortune of a chef if somebody would collect the last words of men who starved to death they d have to sift em mighty fine to discover the sentiment but they d compile into a cook book that would sell into the millions i guess i must have had my conscience pretty well inflicted with culinary meditations for without intending to do so i says out loud to the imaginary waiter cut it thick and have it rare with the french fried and six soft scrambled on toast mame turned her head quick as a wing her eyes were sparkling and she smiled sudden medium for me she rattles out with the juliennes and three straight up draw one and brown the wheats double order to come oh jeff wouldn t it be glorious and then i d like to have a half fry and a little chicken curried with rice and a cup custard with ice cream and go easy i interrupts where s the chicken liver pie and the kidney saute on toast and the roast lamb and oh cuts in mame all excited with mint sauce and the turkey salad and stuffed olives and raspberry tarts and keep it going says i hurry up with the fried squash and the hot corn pone with sweet milk and don t forget the apple dumpling with hard sauce and the cross barred dew berry pie yes for ten minutes we kept up that kind of restaurant repartee we ranges up and down and backward and forward over the main trunk lines and the branches of the victual subject and mame leads the game for she is apprised in the ramifications of grub and the dishes she nominates aggravates my yearnings it seems that there is a feeling that mame will line up friendly again with food it seems that she looks upon the obnoxious science of eating with less contempt than before the next morning we find that the flood has subsided i geared up the bays and we splashed out through the mud some precarious until we found the road again we were only a few miles wrong and in two hours we were in oklahoma city the first thing we saw was a big restaurant sign and we piled into there in a hurry here i finds myself sitting with mame at table with knives and forks and plates between us and she not scornful but smiling with starvation and sweetness twas a new restaurant and well stocked i designated a list of quotations from the bill of fare that made the waiter look out toward the wagon to see how many more might be coming there we were and there was the order being served twas a banquet for a dozen but we felt like a dozen i looked across the table at mame and smiled for i had recollections mame was looking at the table like a boy looks at his first stem winder then she looked at me straight in the face and two big tears came in her eyes the waiter was gone after more grub jeff she says soft like i ve been a foolish girl i ve looked at things from the wrong side i never felt this way before men get hungry every day like this don t they they re big and strong and they do the hard work of the world and they don t eat just to spite silly waiter girls in restaurants do they jeff you said once that is you asked me you wanted me to well jeff if you still care i d be glad and willing to have you always sitting across the table from me now give me something to eat quick please so as i ve said a woman needs to change her point of view now and then they get tired of the same old sights the same old dinner table washtub and sewing machine give em a touch of the various a little travel and a little rest a little tomfoolery along with the tragedies of keeping house a little petting after the blowing up a little upsetting and a little jostling around and everybody in the game will have chips added to their stack by the play the caballero s way the cisco kid had killed six men in more or less fair scrimmages had murdered twice as many mostly mexicans and had winged a larger number whom he modestly forbore to count therefore a woman loved him the kid was twenty five looked twenty and a careful insurance company would have estimated the probable time of his demise at say twenty six his habitat was anywhere between the frio and the rio grande he killed for the love of it because he was quick tempered to avoid arrest for his own amusement any reason that came to his mind would suffice he had escaped capture because he could shoot five sixths of a second sooner than any sheriff or ranger in the service and because he rode a speckled roan horse that knew every cow path in the mesquite and pear thickets from san antonio to matamoras tonia perez the girl who loved the cisco kid was half carmen half madonna and the rest oh yes a woman who is half carmen and half madonna can always be something more the rest let us say was humming bird she lived in a grass roofed jacal near a little mexican settlement at the lone wolf crossing of the frio with her lived a father or grandfather a lineal aztec somewhat less than a thousand years old who herded a hundred goats and lived in a continuous drunken dream from drinking mescal back of the jacal a tremendous forest of bristling pear twenty feet high at its worst crowded almost to its door it was along the bewildering maze of this spinous thicket that the speckled roan would bring the kid to see his girl and once clinging like a lizard to the ridge pole high up under the peaked grass roof he had heard tonia with her madonna face and carmen beauty and humming bird soul parley with the sheriff s posse denying knowledge of her man in her soft melange of spanish and english one day the adjutant general of the state who is ex officio commander of the ranger forces wrote some sarcastic lines to captain duval of company x stationed at laredo relative to the serene and undisturbed existence led by murderers and desperadoes in the said captain s territory the captain turned the colour of brick dust under his tan and forwarded the letter after adding a few comments per ranger private bill adamson to ranger lieutenant sandridge camped at a water hole on the nueces with a squad of five men in preservation of law and order lieutenant sandridge turned a beautiful couleur de rose through his ordinary strawberry complexion tucked the letter in his hip pocket and chewed off the ends of his gamboge moustache the next morning he saddled his horse and rode alone to the mexican settlement at the lone wolf crossing of the frio twenty miles away six feet two blond as a viking quiet as a deacon dangerous as a machine gun sandridge moved among the jacales patiently seeking news of the cisco kid far more than the law the mexicans dreaded the cold and certain vengeance of the lone rider that the ranger sought it had been one of the kid s pastimes to shoot mexicans to see them kick if he demanded from them moribund terpsichorean feats simply that he might be entertained what terrible and extreme penalties would be certain to follow should they anger him one and all they lounged with upturned palms and shrugging shoulders filling the air with quien sabes and denials of the kid s acquaintance but there was a man named fink who kept a store at the crossing a man of many nationalities tongues interests and ways of thinking no use to ask them mexicans he said to sandridge they re afraid to tell this hombre they call the kid goodall is his name ain t it he s been in my store once or twice i have an idea you might run across him at but i guess i don t keer to say myself i m two seconds later in pulling a gun than i used to be and the difference is worth thinking about but this kid s got a half mexican girl at the crossing that he comes to see she lives in that jacal a hundred yards down the arroyo at the edge of the pear maybe she no i don t suppose she would but that jacal would be a good place to watch anyway sandridge rode down to the jacal of perez the sun was low and the broad shade of the great pear thicket already covered the grass thatched hut the goats were enclosed for the night in a brush corral near by a few kids walked the top of it nibbling the chaparral leaves the old mexican lay upon a blanket on the grass already in a stupor from his mescal and dreaming perhaps of the nights when he and pizarro touched glasses to their new world fortunes so old his wrinkled face seemed to proclaim him to be and in the door of the jacal stood tonia and lieutenant sandridge sat in his saddle staring at her like a gannet agape at a sailorman the cisco kid was a vain person as all eminent and successful assassins are and his bosom would have been ruffled had he known that at a simple exchange of glances two persons in whose minds he had been looming large suddenly abandoned at least for the time all thought of him never before had tonia seen such a man as this he seemed to be made of sunshine and blood red tissue and clear weather he seemed to illuminate the shadow of the pear when he smiled as though the sun were rising again the men she had known had been small and dark even the kid in spite of his achievements was a stripling no larger than herself with black straight hair and a cold marble face that chilled the noonday as for tonia though she sends description to the poorhouse let her make a millionaire of your fancy her blue black hair smoothly divided in the middle and bound close to her head and her large eyes full of the latin melancholy gave her the madonna touch her motions and air spoke of the concealed fire and the desire to charm that she had inherited from the gitanas of the basque province as for the humming bird part of her that dwelt in her heart you could not perceive it unless her bright red skirt and dark blue blouse gave you a symbolic hint of the vagarious bird the newly lighted sun god asked for a drink of water tonia brought it from the red jar hanging under the brush shelter sandridge considered it necessary to dismount so as to lessen the trouble of her ministrations i play no spy nor do i assume to master the thoughts of any human heart but i assert by the chronicler s right that before a quarter of an hour had sped sandridge was teaching her how to plaint a six strand rawhide stake rope and tonia had explained to him that were it not for her little english book that the peripatetic padre had given her and the little crippled chivo that she fed from a bottle she would be very very lonely indeed which leads to a suspicion that the kid s fences needed repairing and that the adjutant general s sarcasm had fallen upon unproductive soil in his camp by the water hole lieutenant sandridge announced and reiterated his intention of either causing the cisco kid to nibble the black loam of the frio country prairies or of haling him before a judge and jury that sounded business like twice a week he rode over to the lone wolf crossing of the frio and directed tonia s slim slightly lemon tinted fingers among the intricacies of the slowly growing lariata a six strand plait is hard to learn and easy to teach the ranger knew that he might find the kid there at any visit he kept his armament ready and had a frequent eye for the pear thicket at the rear of the jacal thus he might bring down the kite and the humming bird with one stone while the sunny haired ornithologist was pursuing his studies the cisco kid was also attending to his professional duties he moodily shot up a saloon in a small cow village on quintana creek killed the town marshal plugging him neatly in the centre of his tin badge and then rode away morose and unsatisfied no true artist is uplifted by shooting an aged man carrying an old style bulldog on his way the kid suddenly experienced the yearning that all men feel when wrong doing loses its keen edge of delight he yearned for the woman he loved to reassure him that she was his in spite of it he wanted her to call his bloodthirstiness bravery and his cruelty devotion he wanted tonia to bring him water from the red jar under the brush shelter and tell him how the chivo was thriving on the bottle the kid turned the speckled roan s head up the ten mile pear flat that stretches along the arroyo hondo until it ends at the lone wolf crossing of the frio the roan whickered for he had a sense of locality and direction equal to that of a belt line street car horse and he knew he would soon be nibbling the rich mesquite grass at the end of a forty foot stake rope while ulysses rested his head in circe s straw roofed hut more weird and lonesome than the journey of an amazonian explorer is the ride of one through a texas pear flat with dismal monotony and startling variety the uncanny and multiform shapes of the cacti lift their twisted trunks and fat bristly hands to encumber the way the demon plant appearing to live without soil or rain seems to taunt the parched traveller with its lush grey greenness it warps itself a thousand times about what look to be open and inviting paths only to lure the rider into blind and impassable spine defended bottoms of the bag leaving him to retreat if he can with the points of the compass whirling in his head to be lost in the pear is to die almost the death of the thief on the cross pierced by nails and with grotesque shapes of all the fiends hovering about but it was not so with the kid and his mount winding twisting circling tracing the most fantastic and bewildering trail ever picked out the good roan lessened the distance to the lone wolf crossing with every coil and turn that he made while they fared the kid sang he knew but one tune and sang it as he knew but one code and lived it and but one girl and loved her he was a single minded man of conventional ideas he had a voice like a coyote with bronchitis but whenever he chose to sing his song he sang it it was a conventional song of the camps and trail running at its beginning as near as may be to these words don t you monkey with my lulu girl or i ll tell you what i ll do and so on the roan was inured to it and did not mind but even the poorest singer will after a certain time gain his own consent to refrain from contributing to the world s noises so the kid by the time he was within a mile or two of tonia s jacal had reluctantly allowed his song to die away not because his vocal performance had become less charming to his own ears but because his laryngeal muscles were aweary as though he were in a circus ring the speckled roan wheeled and danced through the labyrinth of pear until at length his rider knew by certain landmarks that the lone wolf crossing was close at hand then where the pear was thinner he caught sight of the grass roof of the jacal and the hackberry tree on the edge of the arroyo a few yards farther the kid stopped the roan and gazed intently through the prickly openings then he dismounted dropped the roan s reins and proceeded on foot stooping and silent like an indian the roan knowing his part stood still making no sound the kid crept noiselessly to the very edge of the pear thicket and reconnoitred between the leaves of a clump of cactus ten yards from his hiding place in the shade of the jacal sat his tonia calmly plaiting a rawhide lariat so far she might surely escape condemnation women have been known from time to time to engage in more mischievous occupations but if all must be told there is to be added that her head reposed against the broad and comfortable chest of a tall red and yellow man and that his arm was about her guiding her nimble fingers that required so many lessons at the intricate six strand plait sandridge glanced quickly at the dark mass of pear when he heard a slight squeaking sound that was not altogether unfamiliar a gun scabbard will make that sound when one grasps the handle of a six shooter suddenly but the sound was not repeated and tonia s fingers needed close attention and then in the shadow of death they began to talk of their love and in the still july afternoon every word they uttered reached the ears of the kid remember then said tonia you must not come again until i send for you soon he will be here a vaquero at the tienda said to day he saw him on the guadalupe three days ago when he is that near he always comes if he comes and finds you here he will kill you so for my sake you must come no more until i send you the word all right said the stranger and then what and then said the girl you must bring your men here and kill him if not he will kill you he ain t a man to surrender that s sure said sandridge it s kill or be killed for the officer that goes up against mr cisco kid he must die said the girl otherwise there will not be any peace in the world for thee and me he has killed many let him so die bring your men and give him no chance to escape you used to think right much of him said sandridge tonia dropped the lariat twisted herself around and curved a lemon tinted arm over the ranger s shoulder but then she murmured in liquid spanish i had not beheld thee thou great red mountain of a man and thou art kind and good as well as strong could one choose him knowing thee let him die for then i will not be filled with fear by day and night lest he hurt thee or me how can i know when he comes asked sandridge when he comes said tonia he remains two days sometimes three gregorio the small son of old luisa the lavendera has a swift pony i will write a letter to thee and send it by him saying how it will be best to come upon him by gregorio will the letter come and bring many men with thee and have much care oh dear red one for the rattlesnake is not quicker to strike than is el chivato as they call him to send a ball from his pistola the kid s handy with his gun sure enough admitted sandridge but when i come for him i shall come alone i ll get him by myself or not at all the cap wrote one or two things to me that make me want to do the trick without any help you let me know when mr kid arrives and i ll do the rest i will send you the message by the boy gregorio said the girl i knew you were braver than that small slayer of men who never smiles how could i ever have thought i cared for him it was time for the ranger to ride back to his camp on the water hole before he mounted his horse he raised the slight form of tonia with one arm high from the earth for a parting salute the drowsy stillness of the torpid summer air still lay thick upon the dreaming afternoon the smoke from the fire in the jacal where the frijoles blubbered in the iron pot rose straight as a plumb line above the clay daubed chimney no sound or movement disturbed the serenity of the dense pear thicket ten yards away when the form of sandridge had disappeared loping his big dun down the steep banks of the frio crossing the kid crept back to his own horse mounted him and rode back along the tortuous trail he had come but not far he stopped and waited in the silent depths of the pear until half an hour had passed and then tonia heard the high untrue notes of his unmusical singing coming nearer and nearer and she ran to the edge of the pear to meet him the kid seldom smiled but he smiled and waved his hat when he saw her he dismounted and his girl sprang into his arms the kid looked at her fondly his thick black hair clung to his head like a wrinkled mat the meeting brought a slight ripple of some undercurrent of feeling to his smooth dark face that was usually as motionless as a clay mask how s my girl he asked holding her close sick of waiting so long for you dear one she answered my eyes are dim with always gazing into that devil s pincushion through which you come and i can see into it such a little way too but you are here beloved one and i will not scold que mal muchacho not to come to see your alma more often go in and rest and let me water your horse and stake him with the long rope there is cool water in the jar for you the kid kissed her affectionately not if the court knows itself do i let a lady stake my horse for me said he but if you ll run in chica and throw a pot of coffee together while i attend to the caballo i ll be a good deal obliged besides his marksmanship the kid had another attribute for which he admired himself greatly he was muy caballero as the mexicans express it where the ladies were concerned for them he had always gentle words and consideration he could not have spoken a harsh word to a woman he might ruthlessly slay their husbands and brothers but he could not have laid the weight of a finger in anger upon a woman wherefore many of that interesting division of humanity who had come under the spell of his politeness declared their disbelief in the stories circulated about mr kid one shouldn t believe everything one heard they said when confronted by their indignant men folk with proof of the caballero s deeds of infamy they said maybe he had been driven to it and that he knew how to treat a lady anyhow considering this extremely courteous idiosyncrasy of the kid and the pride he took in it one can perceive that the solution of the problem that was presented to him by what he saw and heard from his hiding place in the pear that afternoon at least as to one of the actors must have been obscured by difficulties and yet one could not think of the kid overlooking little matters of that kind at the end of the short twilight they gathered around a supper of frijoles goat steaks canned peaches and coffee by the light of a lantern in the jacal afterward the ancestor his flock corralled smoked a cigarette and became a mummy in a grey blanket tonia washed the few dishes while the kid dried them with the flour sacking towel her eyes shone she chatted volubly of the inconsequent happenings of her small world since the kid s last visit it was as all his other home comings had been then outside tonia swung in a grass hammock with her guitar and sang sad canciones de amor do you love me just the same old girl asked the kid hunting for his cigarette papers always the same little one said tonia her dark eyes lingering upon him i must go over to fink s said the kid rising for some tobacco i thought i had another sack in my coat i ll be back in a quarter of an hour hasten said tonia and tell me how long shall i call you my own this time will you be gone again to morrow leaving me to grieve or will you be longer with your tonia oh i might stay two or three days this trip said the kid yawning i ve been on the dodge for a month and i d like to rest up he was gone half an hour for his tobacco when he returned tonia was still lying in the hammock it s funny said the kid how i feel i feel like there was somebody lying behind every bush and tree waiting to shoot me i never had mullygrubs like them before maybe it s one of them presumptions i ve got half a notion to light out in the morning before day the guadalupe country is burning up about that old dutchman i plugged down there you are not afraid no one could make my brave little one fear well i haven t been usually regarded as a jack rabbit when it comes to scrapping but i don t want a posse smoking me out when i m in your jacal somebody might get hurt that oughtn t to remain with your tonia no one will find you here the kid looked keenly into the shadows up and down the arroyo and toward the dim lights of the mexican village i ll see how it looks later on was his decision at midnight a horseman rode into the rangers camp blazing his way by noisy halloes to indicate a pacific mission sandridge and one or two others turned out to investigate the row the rider announced himself to be domingo sales from the lone wolf crossing he bore a letter for senor sandridge old luisa the lavendera had persuaded him to bring it he said her son gregorio being too ill of a fever to ride sandridge lighted the camp lantern and read the letter these were its words dear one he has come hardly had you ridden away when he came out of the pear when he first talked he said he would stay three days or more then as it grew later he was like a wolf or a fox and walked about without rest looking and listening soon he said he must leave before daylight when it is dark and stillest and then he seemed to suspect that i be not true to him he looked at me so strange that i am frightened i swear to him that i love him his own tonia last of all he said i must prove to him i am true he thinks that even now men are waiting to kill him as he rides from my house to escape he says he will dress in my clothes my red skirt and the blue waist i wear and the brown mantilla over the head and thus ride away but before that he says that i must put on his clothes his pantalones and camisa and hat and ride away on his horse from the jacal as far as the big road beyond the crossing and back again this before he goes so he can tell if i am true and if men are hidden to shoot him it is a terrible thing an hour before daybreak this is to be come my dear one and kill this man and take me for your tonia do not try to take hold of him alive but kill him quickly knowing all you should do that you must come long before the time and hide yourself in the little shed near the jacal where the wagon and saddles are kept it is dark in there he will wear my red skirt and blue waist and brown mantilla i send you a hundred kisses come surely and shoot quickly and straight thine own tonia sandridge quickly explained to his men the official part of the missive the rangers protested against his going alone i ll get him easy enough said the lieutenant the girl s got him trapped and don t even think he ll get the drop on me sandridge saddled his horse and rode to the lone wolf crossing he tied his big dun in a clump of brush on the arroyo took his winchester from its scabbard and carefully approached the perez jacal there was only the half of a high moon drifted over by ragged milk white gulf clouds the wagon shed was an excellent place for ambush and the ranger got inside it safely in the black shadow of the brush shelter in front of the jacal he could see a horse tied and hear him impatiently pawing the hard trodden earth he waited almost an hour before two figures came out of the jacal one in man s clothes quickly mounted the horse and galloped past the wagon shed toward the crossing and village and then the other figure in skirt waist and mantilla over its head stepped out into the faint moonlight gazing after the rider sandridge thought he would take his chance then before tonia rode back he fancied she might not care to see it throw up your hands he ordered loudly stepping out of the wagon shed with his winchester at his shoulder there was a quick turn of the figure but no movement to obey so the ranger pumped in the bullets one two three and then twice more for you never could be too sure of bringing down the cisco kid there was no danger of missing at ten paces even in that half moonlight the old ancestor asleep on his blanket was awakened by the shots listening further he heard a great cry from some man in mortal distress or anguish and rose up grumbling at the disturbing ways of moderns the tall red ghost of a man burst into the jacal reaching one hand shaking like a tule reed for the lantern hanging on its nail the other spread a letter on the table look at this letter perez cried the man who wrote it ah dios it is senor sandridge mumbled the old man approaching pues senor that letter was written by el chivato as he is called by the man of tonia they say he is a bad man i do not know while tonia slept he wrote the letter and sent it by this old hand of mine to domingo sales to be brought to you is there anything wrong in the letter i am very old and i did not know valgame dios it is a very foolish world and there is nothing in the house to drink nothing to drink just then all that sandridge could think of to do was to go outside and throw himself face downward in the dust by the side of his humming bird of whom not a feather fluttered he was not a caballero by instinct and he could not understand the niceties of revenge a mile away the rider who had ridden past the wagon shed struck up a harsh untuneful song the words of which began don t you monkey with my lulu girl or i ll tell you what i ll do the sphinx apple twenty miles out from paradise and fifteen miles short of sunrise city bildad rose the stage driver stopped his team a furious snow had been falling all day eight inches it measured now on a level the remainder of the road was not without peril in daylight creeping along the ribs of a bijou range of ragged mountains now when both snow and night masked its dangers further travel was not to be thought of said bildad rose so he pulled up his four stout horses and delivered to his five passengers oral deductions of his wisdom judge menefee to whom men granted leadership and the initiatory as upon a silver salver sprang from the coach at once four of his fellow passengers followed inspired by his example ready to explore to objurgate to resist to submit to proceed according as their prime factor might be inclined to sway them the fifth passenger a young woman remained in the coach bildad had halted upon the shoulder of the first mountain spur two rail fences ragged black hemmed the road fifty yards above the upper fence showing a dark blot in the white drifts stood a small house upon this house descended or rather ascended judge menefee and his cohorts with boyish whoops born of the snow and stress they called they pounded at window and door at the inhospitable silence they waxed restive they assaulted and forced the pregnable barriers and invaded the premises the watchers from the coach heard stumblings and shoutings from the interior of the ravaged house before long a light within flickered glowed flamed high and bright and cheerful then came running back through the driving flakes the exuberant explorers more deeply pitched than the clarion even orchestral in volume the voice of judge menefee proclaimed the succour that lay in apposition with their state of travail the one room of the house was uninhabited he said and bare of furniture but it contained a great fireplace and they had discovered an ample store of chopped wood in a lean to at the rear housing and warmth against the shivering night were thus assured for the placation of bildad rose there was news of a stable not ruined beyond service with hay in a loft near the house gentlemen cried bildad rose from his seat swathed in coats and robes tear me down two panels of that fence so i can drive in that is old man redruth s shanty i thought we must be nigh it they took him to the foolish house in august cheerfully the four passengers sprang at the snow capped rails the exhorted team tugged the coach up the slant to the door of the edifice from which a mid summer madness had ravished its proprietor the driver and two of the passengers began to unhitch judge menefee opened the door of the coach and removed his hat i have to announce miss garland said he the enforced suspension of our journey the driver asserts that the risk in travelling the mountain road by night is too great even to consider it will be necessary to remain in the shelter of this house until morning i beg that you will feel that there is nothing to fear beyond a temporary inconvenience i have personally inspected the house and find that there are means to provide against the rigour of the weather at least you shall be made as comfortable as possible permit me to assist you to alight to the judge s side came the passenger whose pursuit in life was the placing of the little goliath windmill his name was dunwoody but that matters not much in travelling merely from paradise to sunrise city one needs little or no name still one who would seek to divide honours with judge madison l menefee deserves a cognomenal peg upon which fame may hang a wreath thus spake loudly and buoyantly the aerial miller guess you ll have to climb out of the ark mrs mcfarland this wigwam isn t exactly the palmer house but it turns snow and they won t search your grip for souvenir spoons when you leave we ve got a fire going and we ll fix you up with dry tilbys and keep the mice away anyhow all right all right one of the two passengers who were struggling in a melee of horses harness snow and the sarcastic injunctions of bildad rose called loudly from the whirl of his volunteer duties say some of you fellows get miss solomon into the house will you whoa there you confounded brute again must it be gently urged that in travelling from paradise to sunrise city an accurate name is prodigality when judge menefee sanctioned to the act by his grey hair and widespread repute had introduced himself to the lady passenger she had herself sweetly breathed a name in response that the hearing of the male passengers had variously interpreted in the not unjealous spirit of rivalry that eventuated each clung stubbornly to his own theory for the lady passenger to have reasseverated or corrected would have seemed didactic if not unduly solicitous of a specific acquaintance therefore the lady passenger permitted herself to be garlanded and mcfarlanded and solomoned with equal and discreet complacency it is thirty five miles from paradise to sunrise city compagnon de voyage is name enough by the gripsack of the wandering jew for so brief a journey soon the little party of wayfarers were happily seated in a cheerful arc before the roaring fire the robes cushions and removable portions of the coach had been brought in and put to service the lady passenger chose a place near the hearth at one end of the arc there she graced almost a throne that her subjects had prepared she sat upon cushions and leaned against an empty box and barrel robe bespread which formed a defence from the invading draughts she extended her feet delectably shod to the cordial heat she ungloved her hands but retained about her neck her long fur boa the unstable flames half revealed while the warding boa half submerged her face a youthful face altogether feminine clearly moulded and calm with beauty s unchallenged confidence chivalry and manhood were here vying to please and comfort her she seemed to accept their devoirs not piquantly as one courted and attended nor preeningly as many of her sex unworthily reap their honours not yet stolidly as the ox receives his hay but concordantly with nature s own plan as the lily ingests the drop of dew foreordained to its refreshment outside the wind roared mightily the fine snow whizzed through the cracks the cold besieged the backs of the immolated six but the elements did not lack a champion that night judge menefee was attorney for the storm the weather was his client and he strove by special pleading to convince his companions in that frigid jury box that they sojourned in a bower of roses beset only by benignant zephyrs he drew upon a fund of gaiety wit and anecdote sophistical but crowned with success his cheerfulness communicated itself irresistibly each one hastened to contribute his own quota toward the general optimism even the lady passenger was moved to expression i think it is quite charming she said in her slow crystal tones at intervals some one of the passengers would rise and humorously explore the room there was little evidence to be collected of its habitation by old man redruth bildad rose was called upon vivaciously for the ex hermit s history now since the stage driver s horses were fairly comfortable and his passengers appeared to be so peace and comity returned to him the old didapper began bildad somewhat irreverently infested this here house about twenty year he never allowed nobody to come nigh him he d duck his head inside and slam the door whenever a team drove along there was spinning wheels up in his loft all right he used to buy his groceries and tobacco at sam tilly s store on the little muddy last august he went up there dressed in a red bedquilt and told sam he was king solomon and that the queen of sheba was coming to visit him he fetched along all the money he had a little bag full of silver and dropped it in sam s well she won t come says old man redruth to sam if she knows i ve got any money as soon as folks heard he had that sort of a theory about women and money they knowed he was crazy so they sent down and packed him to the foolish asylum was there a romance in his life that drove him to a solitary existence asked one of the passengers a young man who had an agency no said bildad not that i ever heard spoke of just ordinary trouble they say he had had unfortunateness in the way of love derangements with a young lady when he was young before he contracted red bed quilts and had his financial conclusions disqualified i never heard of no romance ah exclaimed judge menefee impressively a case of unrequited affection no doubt no sir returned bildad not at all she never married him marmaduke mulligan down at paradise seen a man once that come from old redruth s town he said redruth was a fine young man but when you kicked him on the pocket all you could hear jingle was a cuff fastener and a bunch of keys he was engaged to this young lady miss alice something was her name i ve forgot this man said she was the kind of girl you like to have reach across you in a car to pay the fare well there come to the town a young chap all affluent and easy and fixed up with buggies and mining stock and leisure time although she was a staked claim miss alice and the new entry seemed to strike a mutual kind of a clip they had calls and coincidences of going to the post office and such things as sometimes make a girl send back the engagement ring and other presents a rift within the loot the poetry man calls it one day folks seen redruth and miss alice standing talking at the gate then he lifts his hat and walks away and that was the last anybody in that town seen of him as far as this man knew what about the young lady asked the young man who had an agency never heard answered bildad right there is where my lode of information turns to an old spavined crowbait and folds its wings for i ve pumped it dry a very sad began judge menefee but his remark was curtailed by a higher authority what a charming story said the lady passenger in flute like tones a little silence followed except for the wind and the crackling of the fire the men were seated upon the floor having slightly mitigated its inhospitable surface with wraps and stray pieces of boards the man who was placing little goliath windmills arose and walked about to ease his cramped muscles suddenly a triumphant shout came from him he hurried back from a dusky corner of the room bearing aloft something in his hand it was an apple a large red mottled firm pippin pleasing to behold in a paper bag on a high shelf in that corner he had found it it could have been no relic of the lovewrecked redruth for its glorious soundness repudiated the theory that it had lain on that musty shelf since august no doubt some recent bivouackers lunching in the deserted house had left it there dunwoody again his exploits demand for him the honours of nomenclature flaunted his apple in the faces of his fellow marooners see what i found mrs mcfarland he cried vaingloriously he held the apple high up in the light of the fire where it glowed a still richer red the lady passenger smiled calmly always calmly what a charming apple she murmured clearly for a brief space judge menefee felt crushed humiliated relegated second place galled him why had this blatant obtrusive unpolished man of windmills been selected by fate instead of himself to discover the sensational apple he could have made of the act a scene a function a setting for some impromptu fanciful discourse or piece of comedy and have retained the role of cynosure actually the lady passenger was regarding this ridiculous dunboddy or woodbundy with an admiring smile as if the fellow had performed a feat and the windmill man swelled and gyrated like a sample of his own goods puffed up with the wind that ever blows from the chorus land toward the domain of the star while the transported dunwoody with his aladdin s apple was receiving the fickle attentions of all the resourceful jurist formed a plan to recover his own laurels with his courtliest smile upon his heavy but classic features judge menefee advanced and took the apple as if to examine it from the hand of dunwoody in his hand it became exhibit a a fine apple he said approvingly really my dear mr dudwindy you have eclipsed all of us as a forager but i have an idea this apple shall become an emblem a token a symbol a prize bestowed by the mind and heart of beauty upon the most deserving the audience except one applauded good on the stump ain t he commented the passenger who was nobody in particular to the young man who had an agency the unresponsive one was the windmill man he saw himself reduced to the ranks never would the thought have occurred to him to declare his apple an emblem he had intended after it had been divided and eaten to create diversion by sticking the seeds against his forehead and naming them for young ladies of his acquaintance one he was going to name mrs mcfarland the seed that fell off first would be but twas too late now the apple continued judge menefee charging his jury in modern days occupies though undeservedly a lowly place in our esteem indeed it is so constantly associated with the culinary and the commercial that it is hardly to be classed among the polite fruits but in ancient times this was not so biblical historical and mythological lore abounds with evidences that the apple was the aristocrat of fruits we still say the apple of the eye when we wish to describe something superlatively precious we find in proverbs the comparison to apples of silver no other product of tree or vine has been so utilised in figurative speech who has not heard of and longed for the apples of the hesperides i need not call your attention to the most tremendous and significant instance of the apple s ancient prestige when its consumption by our first parents occasioned the fall of man from his state of goodness and perfection apples like them said the windmill man lingering with the objective article are worth a barrel in the chicago market now what i have to propose said judge menefee conceding an indulgent smile to his interrupter is this we must remain here perforce until morning we have wood in plenty to keep us warm our next need is to entertain ourselves as best we can in order that the time shall not pass too slowly i propose that we place this apple in the hands of miss garland it is no longer a fruit but as i said a prize in award representing a great human idea miss garland herself shall cease to be an individual but only temporarily i am happy to add a low bow full of the old time grace she shall represent her sex she shall be the embodiment the epitome of womankind the heart and brain i may say of god s masterpiece of creation in this guise she shall judge and decide the question which follows but a few minutes ago our friend mr rose favoured us with an entertaining but fragmentary sketch of the romance in the life of the former professor of this habitation the few facts that we have learned seem to me to open up a fascinating field for conjecture for the study of human hearts for the exercise of the imagination in short for story telling let us make use of the opportunity let each one of us relate his own version of the story of redruth the hermit and his lady love beginning where mr rose s narrative ends at the parting of the lovers at the gate this much should be assumed and conceded that the young lady was not necessarily to blame for redruth s becoming a crazed and world hating hermit when we have done miss garland shall render the judgement of woman as the spirit of her sex she shall decide which version of the story best and most truly depicts human and love interest and most faithfully estimates the character and acts of redruth s betrothed according to the feminine view the apple shall be bestowed upon him who is awarded the decision if you are all agreed we shall be pleased to hear the first story from mr dinwiddie the last sentence captured the windmill man he was not one to linger in the dumps that s a first rate scheme judge he said heartily be a regular short story vaudeville won t it i used to be correspondent for a paper in springfield and when there wasn t any news i faked it guess i can do my turn all right i think the idea is charming said the lady passenger brightly it will be almost like a game judge menefee stepped forward and placed the apple in her hand impressively in olden days he said orotundly paris awarded the golden apple to the most beautiful i was at the exposition remarked the windmill man now cheerful again but i never heard of it and i was on the midway too all the time i wasn t at the machinery exhibit but now continued the judge the fruit shall translate to us the mystery and wisdom of the feminine heart take the apple miss garland hear our modest tales of romance and then award the prize as you may deem it just the lady passenger smiled sweetly the apple lay in her lap beneath her robes and wraps she reclined against her protecting bulwark brightly and cosily at ease but for the voices and the wind one might have listened hopefully to hear her purr someone cast fresh logs upon the fire judge menefee nodded suavely will you oblige us with the initial story he asked the windmill man sat as sits a turk with his hat well back on his head on account of the draughts well he began without any embarrassment this is about the way i size up the difficulty of course redruth was jostled a good deal by this duck who had money to play ball with who tried to cut him out of his girl so he goes around naturally and asks her if the game is still square well nobody wants a guy cutting in with buggies and gold bonds when he s got an option on a girl well he goes around to see her well maybe he s hot and talks like the proprietor and forgets that an engagement ain t always a lead pipe cinch well i guess that makes alice warm under the lacy yoke well she answers back sharp well he say interrupted the passenger who was nobody in particular if you could put up a windmill on every one of them wells you re using you d be able to retire from business wouldn t you the windmill man grinned good naturedly oh i ain t no guy de mopassong he said cheerfully i m giving it to you in straight american well she says something like this mr gold bonds is only a friend says she but he takes me riding and buys me theatre tickets and that s what you never do ain t i to never have any pleasure in life while i can pass this chatfield chatfield thing along says redruth hand out the mitt to the willie with creases in it or you don t put your slippers under my wardrobe now that kind of train orders don t go with a girl that s got any spirit i bet that girl loved her honey all the time maybe she only wanted as girls do to work the good thing for a little fun and caramels before she settled down to patch george s other pair and be a good wife but he is glued to the high horse and won t come down well she hands him back the ring proper enough and george goes away and hits the booze yep that s what done it i bet that girl fired the cornucopia with the fancy vest two days after her steady left george boards a freight and checks his bag of crackers for parts unknown he sticks to old booze for a number of years and then the aniline and aquafortis gets the decision me for the hermit s hut says george and the long whiskers and the buried can of money that isn t there but that alice in my mind was on the level she never married but took up typewriting as soon as the wrinkles began to show and kept a cat that came when you said weeny weeny weeny i got too much faith in good women to believe they throw down the fellow they re stuck on every time for the dough the windmill man ceased i think said the lady passenger slightly moving upon her lowly throne that that is a char oh miss garland interposed judge menefee with uplifted hand i beg of you no comments it would not be fair to the other contestants mr er will you take the next turn the judge addressed the young man who had the agency my version of the romance began the young man diffidently clasping his hands would be this they did not quarrel when they parted mr redruth bade her good by and went out into the world to seek his fortune he knew his love would remain true to him he scorned the thought that his rival could make an impression upon a heart so fond and faithful i would say that mr redruth went out to the rocky mountains in wyoming to seek for gold one day a crew of pirates landed and captured him while at work and hey what s that sharply called the passenger who was nobody in particular a crew of pirates landed in the rocky mountains will you tell us how they sailed landed from a train said the narrator quietly and not without some readiness they kept him prisoner in a cave for months and then they took him hundreds of miles away to the forests of alaska there a beautiful indian girl fell in love with him but he remained true to alice after another year of wandering in the woods he set out with the diamonds what diamonds asked the unimportant passenger almost with acerbity the ones the saddlemaker showed him in the peruvian temple said the other somewhat obscurely when he reached home alice s mother led him weeping to a green mound under a willow tree her heart was broken when you left said her mother and what of my rival of chester mcintosh asked mr redruth as he knelt sadly by alice s grave when he found out she answered that her heart was yours he pined away day by day until at length he started a furniture store in grand rapids we heard lately that he was bitten to death by an infuriated moose near south bend ind where he had gone to try to forget scenes of civilisation with which mr redruth forsook the face of mankind and became a hermit as we have seen my story concluded the young man with an agency may lack the literary quality but what i wanted it to show is that the young lady remained true she cared nothing for wealth in comparison with true affection i admire and believe in the fair sex too much to think otherwise the narrator ceased with a sidelong glance at the corner where reclined the lady passenger bildad rose was next invited by judge menefee to contribute his story in the contest for the apple of judgment the stage driver s essay was brief i m not one of them lobo wolves he said who are always blaming on women the calamities of life my testimony in regards to the fiction story you ask for judge will be about as follows what ailed redruth was pure laziness if he had up and slugged this percival de lacey that tried to give him the outside of the road and had kept alice in the grape vine swing with the blind bridle on all would have been well the woman you want is sure worth taking pains for send for me if you want me again says redruth and hoists his stetson and walks off he d have called it pride but the nixycomlogical name for it is laziness no woman don t like to run after a man let him come back hisself says the girl and i ll be bound she tells the boy with the pay ore to trot and then spends her time watching out the window for the man with the empty pocket book and the tickly moustache i reckon redruth waits about nine year expecting her to send him a note by a nigger asking him to forgive her but she don t this game won t work says redruth then so won t i and he goes in the hermit business and raises whiskers yes laziness and whiskers was what done the trick they travel together you ever hear of a man with long whiskers and hair striking a bonanza no look at the duke of marlborough and this standard oil snoozer have they got em now this alice didn t never marry i ll bet a hoss if redruth had married somebody else she might have done so too but he never turns up she has these here things they call fond memories and maybe a lock of hair and a corset steel that he broke treasured up them sort of articles is as good as a husband to some women i d say she played out a lone hand i don t blame no woman for old man redruth s abandonment of barber shops and clean shirts next in order came the passenger who was nobody in particular nameless to us he travels the road from paradise to sunrise city but him you shall see if the firelight be not too dim as he responds to the judge s call a lean form in rusty brown clothing sitting like a frog his arms wrapped about his legs his chin resting upon his knees smooth oakum coloured hair long nose mouth like a satyr s with upturned tobacco stained corners an eye like a fish s a red necktie with a horseshoe pin he began with a rasping chuckle that gradually formed itself into words everybody wrong so far what a romance without any orange blossoms ho ho my money on the lad with the butterfly tie and the certified checks in his trouserings take em as they parted at the gate all right you never loved me says redruth wildly or you wouldn t speak to a man who can buy you the ice cream i hate him says she i loathe his side bar buggy i despise the elegant cream bonbons he sends me in gilt boxes covered with real lace i feel that i could stab him to the heart when he presents me with a solid medallion locket with turquoises and pearls running in a vine around the border away with him tis only you i love back to the cosey corner says redruth was i bound and lettered in east aurora get platonic if you please no jack pots for mine go and hate your friend some more for me the nickerson girl on avenue b and gum and a trolley ride around that night comes john w croesus what tears says he arranging his pearl pin you have driven my lover away says little alice sobbing i hate the sight of you marry me then says john w lighting a henry clay what she cries indignantly marry you never she says until this blows over and i can do some shopping and you see about the licence there s a telephone next door if you want to call up the county clerk the narrator paused to give vent to his cynical chuckle did they marry he continued did the duck swallow the june bug and then i take up the case of old boy redruth there s where you are all wrong again according to my theory what turned him into a hermit one says laziness one says remorse one says booze i say women did it how old is the old man now asked the speaker turning to bildad rose i should say about sixty five all right he conducted his hermit shop here for twenty years say he was twenty five when he took off his hat at the gate that leaves twenty years for him to account for or else be docked where did he spend that ten and two fives i ll give you my idea up for bigamy say there was the fat blonde in saint jo and the panatela brunette at skillet ridge and the gold tooth down in the kaw valley redruth gets his cases mixed and they send him up the road he gets out after they are through with him and says any line for me except the crinoline the hermit trade is not overdone and the stenographers never apply to em for work the jolly hermit s life for me no more long hairs in the comb or dill pickles lying around in the cigar tray you tell me they pinched old redruth for the noodle villa just because he said he was king solomon figs he was solomon that s all of mine i guess it don t call for any apples enclosed find stamps it don t sound much like a prize winner respecting the stricture laid by judge menefee against comments upon the stories all were silent when the passenger who was nobody in particular had concluded and then the ingenious originator of the contest cleared his throat to begin the ultimate entry for the prize though seated with small comfort upon the floor you might search in vain for any abatement of dignity in judge menefee the now diminishing firelight played softly upon his face as clearly chiselled as a roman emperor s on some old coin and upon the thick waves of his honourable grey hair a woman s heart he began in even but thrilling tones who can hope to fathom it the ways and desires of men are various i think that the hearts of all women beat with the same rhythm and to the same old tune of love love to a woman means sacrifice if she be worthy of the name no gold or rank will outweigh with her a genuine devotion gentlemen of the er i should say my friends the case of redruth versus love and affection has been called yet who is on trial not redruth for he has been punished not those immortal passions that clothe our lives with the joy of the angels then who each man of us here to night stands at the bar to answer if chivalry or darkness inhabits his bosom to judge us sits womankind in the form of one of its fairest flowers in her hand she holds the prize intrinsically insignificant but worthy of our noblest efforts to win as a guerdon of approval from so worthy a representative of feminine judgment and taste in taking up the imaginary history of redruth and the fair being to whom he gave his heart i must in the beginning raise my voice against the unworthy insinuation that the selfishness or perfidy or love of luxury of any woman drove him to renounce the world i have not found woman to be so unspiritual or venal we must seek elsewhere among man s baser nature and lower motives for the cause there was in all probability a lover s quarrel as they stood at the gate on that memorable day tormented by jealousy young redruth vanished from his native haunts but had he just cause to do so there is no evidence for or against but there is something higher than evidence there is the grand eternal belief in woman s goodness in her steadfastness against temptation in her loyalty even in the face of proffered riches i picture to myself the rash lover wandering self tortured about the world i picture his gradual descent and finally his complete despair when he realises that he has lost the most precious gift life had to offer him then his withdrawal from the world of sorrow and the subsequent derangement of his faculties becomes intelligible but what do i see on the other hand a lonely woman fading away as the years roll by still faithful still waiting still watching for a form and listening for a step that will come no more she is old now her hair is white and smoothly banded each day she sits at the door and gazes longingly down the dusty road in spirit she is waiting there at the gate just as he left her his forever but not here below yes my belief in woman paints that picture in my mind parted forever on earth but waiting she in anticipation of a meeting in elysium he in the slough of despond i thought he was in the bughouse said the passenger who was nobody in particular judge menefee stirred a little impatiently the men sat drooping in grotesque attitudes the wind had abated its violence coming now in fitful virulent puffs the fire had burned to a mass of red coals which shed but a dim light within the room the lady passenger in her cosey nook looked to be but a formless dark bulk crowned by a mass of coiled sleek hair and showing but a small space of snowy forehead above her clinging boa judge menefee got stiffly to his feet and now miss garland he announced we have concluded it is for you to award the prize to the one of us whose argument especially i may say in regard to his estimate of true womanhood approaches nearest to your own conception no answer came from the lady passenger judge menefee bent over solicitously the passenger who was nobody in particular laughed low and harshly the lady was sleeping sweetly the judge essayed to take her hand to awaken her in doing so he touched a small cold round irregular something in her lap she has eaten the apple announced judge menefee in awed tones as he held up the core for them to see the missing chord i stopped overnight at the sheep ranch of rush kinney on the sandy fork of the nueces mr kinney and i had been strangers up to the time when i called hallo at his hitching rack but from that moment until my departure on the next morning we were according to the texas code undeniable friends after supper the ranchman and i lugged our chairs outside the two room house to its floorless gallery roofed with chaparral and sacuista grass with the rear legs of our chairs sinking deep into the hardpacked loam each of us reposed against an elm pillar of the structure and smoked el toro tobacco while we wrangled amicably concerning the affairs of the rest of the world as for conveying adequate conception of the engaging charm of that prairie evening despair waits upon it it is a bold chronicler who will undertake the description of a texas night in the early spring an inventory must suffice the ranch rested upon the summit of a lenient slope the ambient prairie diversified by arroyos and murky patches of brush and pear lay around us like a darkened bowl at the bottom of which we reposed as dregs like a turquoise cover the sky pinned us there the miraculous air heady with ozone and made memorably sweet by leagues of wild flowerets gave tang and savour to the breath in the sky was a great round mellow searchlight which we knew to be no moon but the dark lantern of summer who came to hunt northward the cowering spring in the nearest corral a flock of sheep lay silent until a groundless panic would send a squad of them huddling together with a drumming rush for other sounds a shrill family of coyotes yapped beyond the shearing pen and whippoorwills twittered in the long grass but even these dissonances hardly rippled the clear torrent of the mocking birds notes that fell from a dozen neighbouring shrubs and trees it would not have been preposterous for one to tiptoe and essay to touch the stars they hung so bright and imminent mr kinney s wife a young and capable woman we had left in the house she remained to busy herself with the domestic round of duties in which i had observed that she seemed to take a buoyant and contented pride in one room we had supped presently from the other as kinney and i sat without there burst a volume of sudden and brilliant music if i could justly estimate the art of piano playing the construer of that rollicking fantasia had creditably mastered the secrets of the keyboard a piano and one so well played seemed to me to be an unusual thing to find in that small and unpromising ranch house i must have looked my surprise at rush kinney for he laughed in his soft southern way and nodded at me through the moonlit haze of our cigarettes you don t often hear as agreeable a noise as that on a sheep ranch he remarked but i never see any reason for not playing up to the arts and graces just because we happen to live out in the brush it s a lonesome life for a woman and if a little music can make it any better why not have it that s the way i look at it a wise and generous theory i assented and mrs kinney plays well i am not learned in the science of music but i should call her an uncommonly good performer she has technic and more than ordinary power the moon was very bright you will understand and i saw upon kinney s face a sort of amused and pregnant expression as though there were things behind it that might be expounded you came up the trail from the double elm fork he said promisingly as you crossed it you must have seen an old deserted jacal to your left under a comma mott i did said i there was a drove of javalis rooting around it i could see by the broken corrals that no one lived there that s where this music proposition started said kinney i don t mind telling you about it while we smoke that s where old cal adams lived he had about eight hundred graded merinos and a daughter that was solid silk and as handsome as a new stake rope on a thirty dollar pony and i don t mind telling you that i was guilty in the second degree of hanging around old cal s ranch all the time i could spare away from lambing and shearing miss marilla was her name and i had figured it out by the rule of two that she was destined to become the chatelaine and lady superior of rancho lomito belonging to r kinney esq where you are now a welcome and honoured guest i will say that old cal wasn t distinguished as a sheepman he was a little old stoop shouldered hombre about as big as a gun scabbard with scraggy white whiskers and condemned to the continuous use of language old cal was so obscure in his chosen profession that he wasn t even hated by the cowmen and when a sheepman don t get eminent enough to acquire the hostility of the cattlemen he is mighty apt to die unwept and considerably unsung but that marilla girl was a benefit to the eye and she was the most elegant kind of a housekeeper i was the nearest neighbour and i used to ride over to the double elm anywhere from nine to sixteen times a week with fresh butter or a quarter of venison or a sample of new sheep dip just as a frivolous excuse to see marilla marilla and me got to be extensively inveigled with each other and i was pretty sure i was going to get my rope around her neck and lead her over to the lomito only she was so everlastingly permeated with filial sentiments toward old cal that i never could get her to talk about serious matters you never saw anybody in your life that was as full of knowledge and had less sense than old cal he was advised about all the branches of information contained in learning and he was up to all the rudiments of doctrines and enlightenment you couldn t advance him any ideas on any of the parts of speech or lines of thought you would have thought he was a professor of the weather and politics and chemistry and natural history and the origin of derivations any subject you brought up old cal could give you an abundant synopsis of it from the greek root up to the time it was sacked and on the market one day just after the fall shearing i rides over to the double elm with a lady s magazine about fashions for marilla and a scientific paper for old cal while i was tying my pony to a mesquite out runs marilla tickled to death with some news that couldn t wait oh rush she says all flushed up with esteem and gratification what do you think dad s going to buy me a piano ain t it grand i never dreamed i d ever have one it s sure joyful says i i always admired the agreeable uproar of a piano it ll be lots of company for you that s mighty good of uncle cal to do that i m all undecided says marilla between a piano and an organ a parlour organ is nice either of em says i is first class for mitigating the lack of noise around a sheep ranch for my part i says i shouldn t like anything better than to ride home of an evening and listen to a few waltzes and jigs with somebody about your size sitting on the piano stool and rounding up the notes oh hush about that says marilla and go on in the house dad hasn t rode out to day he s not feeling well old cal was inside lying on a cot he had a pretty bad cold and cough i stayed to supper going to get marilla a piano i hear says i to him why yes something of the kind rush says he she s been hankering for music for a long spell and i allow to fix her up with something in that line right away the sheep sheared six pounds all round this fall and i m going to get marilla an instrument if it takes the price of the whole clip to do it star wayno says i the little girl deserves it i m going to san antone on the last load of wool says uncle cal and select an instrument for her myself wouldn t it be better i suggests to take marilla along and let her pick out one that she likes i might have known that would set uncle cal going of course a man like him that knew everything about everything would look at that as a reflection on his attainments no sir it wouldn t says he pulling at his white whiskers there ain t a better judge of musical instruments in the whole world than what i am i had an uncle says he that was a partner in a piano factory and i ve seen thousands of em put together i know all about musical instruments from a pipe organ to a corn stalk fiddle there ain t a man lives sir that can tell me any news about any instrument that has to be pounded blowed scraped grinded picked or wound with a key you get me what you like dad says marilla who couldn t keep her feet on the floor from joy of course you know what to select i d just as lief it was a piano or a organ or what i see in st louis once what they call a orchestrion says uncle cal that i judged was about the finest thing in the way of music ever invented but there ain t room in this house for one anyway i imagine they d cost a thousand dollars i reckon something in the piano line would suit marilla the best she took lessons in that respect for two years over at birdstail i wouldn t trust the buying of an instrument to anybody else but myself i reckon if i hadn t took up sheep raising i d have been one of the finest composers or piano and organ manufacturers in the world that was uncle cal s style but i never lost any patience with him on account of his thinking so much of marilla and she thought just as much of him he sent her to the academy over at birdstail for two years when it took nearly every pound of wool to pay the expenses along about tuesday uncle cal put out for san antone on the last wagonload of wool marilla s uncle ben who lived in birdstail come over and stayed at the ranch while uncle cal was gone it was ninety miles to san antone and forty to the nearest railroad station so uncle cal was gone about four days i was over at the double elm when he came rolling back one evening about sundown and up there in the wagon sure enough was a piano or a organ we couldn t tell which all wrapped up in woolsacks with a wagon sheet tied over it in case of rain and out skips marilla hollering oh oh with her eyes shining and her hair a flying dad dad she sings out have you brought it have you brought it and it right there before her eyes as women will do finest piano in san antone says uncle cal waving his hand proud genuine rosewood and the finest loudest tone you ever listened to i heard the storekeeper play it and i took it on the spot and paid cash down me and ben and uncle cal and a mexican lifted it out of the wagon and carried it in the house and set it in a corner it was one of them upright instruments and not very heavy or very big and then all of a sudden uncle cal flops over and says he s mighty sick he s got a high fever and he complains of his lungs he gets into bed while me and ben goes out to unhitch and put the horses in the pasture and marilla flies around to get uncle cal something hot to drink but first she puts both arms on that piano and hugs it with a soft kind of a smile like you see kids doing with their christmas toys when i came in from the pasture marilla was in the room where the piano was i could see by the strings and woolsacks on the floor that she had had it unwrapped but now she was tying the wagon sheet over it again and there was a kind of solemn whitish look on her face ain t wrapping up the music again are you marilla i asks what s the matter with just a couple of tunes for to see how she goes under the saddle not to night rush says she i don t want to play any to night dad s too sick just think rush he paid three hundred dollars for it nearly a third of what the wool clip brought well it ain t anyways in the neighbourhood of a third of what you are worth i told her and i don t think uncle cal is too sick to hear a little agitation of the piano keys just to christen the machine not to night rush says marilla in a way that she had when she wanted to settle things but it seems that uncle cal was plenty sick after all he got so bad that ben saddled up and rode over to birdstail for doc simpson i stayed around to see if i d be needed for anything when uncle cal s pain let up on him a little he called marilla and says to her did you look at your instrument honey and do you like it it s lovely dad says she leaning down by his pillow i never saw one so pretty how dear and good it was of you to buy it for me i haven t heard you play on it any yet says uncle cal and i ve been listening my side don t hurt quite so bad now won t you play a piece marilla but no she puts uncle cal off and soothes him down like you ve seen women do with a kid it seems she s made up her mind not to touch that piano at present when doc simpson comes over he tells us that uncle cal has pneumonia the worst kind and as the old man was past sixty and nearly on the lift anyhow the odds was against his walking on grass any more on the fourth day of his sickness he calls for marilla again and wants to talk piano doc simpson was there and so was ben and mrs ben trying to do all they could i d have made a wonderful success in anything connected with music says uncle cal i got the finest instrument for the money in san antone ain t that piano all right in every respect marilla it s just perfect dad says she it s got the finest tone i ever heard but don t you think you could sleep a little while now dad no i don t says uncle cal i want to hear that piano i don t believe you ve even tried it yet i went all the way to san antone and picked it out for you myself it took a third of the fall clip to buy it but i don t mind that if it makes my good girl happier won t you play a little bit for dad marilla doc simpson beckoned marilla to one side and recommended her to do what uncle cal wanted so it would get him quieted and her uncle ben and his wife asked her too why not hit out a tune or two with the soft pedal on i asks marilla uncle cal has begged you so often it would please him a good deal to hear you touch up the piano he s bought for you don t you think you might but marilla stands there with big tears rolling down from her eyes and says nothing and then she runs over and slips her arm under uncle cal s neck and hugs him tight why last night dad we heard her say i played it ever so much honest i have been playing it and it s such a splendid instrument you don t know how i love it last night i played bonnie dundee and the anvil polka and the blue danube and lots of pieces you must surely have heard me playing a little didn t you dad i didn t like to play loud when you was so sick well well says uncle cal maybe i did maybe i did and forgot about it my head is a little cranky at times i heard the man in the store play it fine i m mighty glad you like it marilla yes i believe i could go to sleep a while if you ll stay right beside me till i do there was where marilla had me guessing much as she thought of that old man she wouldn t strike a note on that piano that he d bought her i couldn t imagine why she told him she d been playing it for the wagon sheet hadn t ever been off of it since she put it back on the same day it come i knew she could play a little anyhow for i d once heard her snatch some pretty fair dance music out of an old piano at the charco largo ranch well in about a week the pneumonia got the best of uncle cal they had the funeral over at birdstail and all of us went over i brought marilla back home in my buckboard her uncle ben and his wife were going to stay there a few days with her that night marilla takes me in the room where the piano was while the others were out on the gallery come here rush says she i want you to see this now she unties the rope and drags off the wagon sheet if you ever rode a saddle without a horse or fired off a gun that wasn t loaded or took a drink out of an empty bottle why then you might have been able to scare an opera or two out of the instrument uncle cal had bought instead of a piano it was one of the machines they ve invented to play the piano with by itself it was about as musical as the holes of a flute without the flute and that was the piano that uncle cal had selected and standing by it was the good fine all wool girl that never let him know it and what you heard playing a while ago concluded mr kinney was that same deputy piano machine only just at present it s shoved up against a six hundred dollar piano that i bought for marilla as soon as we was married a call loan in those days the cattlemen were the anointed they were the grandees of the grass kings of the kine lords of the lea barons of beef and bone they might have ridden in golden chariots had their tastes so inclined the cattleman was caught in a stampede of dollars it seemed to him that he had more money than was decent but when he had bought a watch with precious stones set in the case so large that they hurt his ribs and a california saddle with silver nails and angora skin suaderos and ordered everybody up to the bar for whisky what else was there for him to spend money for not so circumscribed in expedient for the reduction of surplus wealth were those lairds of the lariat who had womenfolk to their name in the breast of the rib sprung sex the genius of purse lightening may slumber through years of inopportunity but never my brothers does it become extinct so out of the chaparral came long bill longley from the bar circle branch on the frio a wife driven man to taste the urban joys of success something like half a million dollars he had with an income steadily increasing long bill was a graduate of the camp and trail luck and thrift a cool head and a telescopic eye for mavericks had raised him from cowboy to be a cowman then came the boom in cattle and fortune stepping gingerly among the cactus thorns came and emptied her cornucopia at the doorstep of the ranch in the little frontier city of chaparosa longley built a costly residence here he became a captive bound to the chariot of social existence he was doomed to become a leading citizen he struggled for a time like a mustang in his first corral and then he hung up his quirt and spurs time hung heavily on his hands he organised the first national bank of chaparosa and was elected its president one day a dyspeptic man wearing double magnifying glasses inserted an official looking card between the bars of the cashier s window of the first national bank five minutes later the bank force was dancing at the beck and call of a national bank examiner this examiner mr j edgar todd proved to be a thorough one at the end of it all the examiner put on his hat and called the president mr william r longley into the private office well how do you find things asked longley in his slow deep tones any brands in the round up you didn t like the looks of the bank checks up all right mr longley said todd and i find your loans in very good shape with one exception you are carrying one very bad bit of paper one that is so bad that i have been thinking that you surely do not realise the serious position it places you in i refer to a call loan of made to thomas merwin not only is the amount in excess of the maximum sum the bank can loan any individual legally but it is absolutely without endorsement or security thus you have doubly violated the national banking laws and have laid yourself open to criminal prosecution by the government a report of the matter to the comptroller of the currency which i am bound to make would i am sure result in the matter being turned over to the department of justice for action you see what a serious thing it is bill longley was leaning his lengthy slowly moving frame back in his swivel chair his hands were clasped behind his head and he turned a little to look the examiner in the face the examiner was surprised to see a smile creep about the rugged mouth of the banker and a kindly twinkle in his light blue eyes if he saw the seriousness of the affair it did not show in his countenance of course you don t know tom merwin said longley almost genially yes i know about that loan it hasn t any security except tom merwin s word somehow i ve always found that when a man s word is good it s the best security there is oh yes i know the government doesn t think so i guess i ll see tom about that note mr todd s dyspepsia seemed to grow suddenly worse he looked at the chaparral banker through his double magnifying glasses in amazement you see said longley easily explaining the thing away tom heard of head of two year olds down near rocky ford on the rio grande that could be had for a head i reckon twas one of old leandro garcia s outfits that he had smuggled over and he wanted to make a quick turn on em those cattle are worth on the hoof in kansas city tom knew it and i knew it he had and i let him have the to make the deal with his brother ed took em on to market three weeks ago he ought to be back most any day now with the money when he comes tom ll pay that note the bank examiner was shocked it was perhaps his duty to step out to the telegraph office and wire the situation to the comptroller but he did not he talked pointedly and effectively to longley for three minutes he succeeded in making the banker understand that he stood upon the border of a catastrophe and then he offered a tiny loophole of escape i am going to hilldale s to night he told longley to examine a bank there i will pass through chaparosa on my way back at twelve o clock to morrow i shall call at this bank if this loan has been cleared out of the way by that time it will not be mentioned in my report if not i will have to do my duty with that the examiner bowed and departed the president of the first national lounged in his chair half an hour longer and then he lit a mild cigar and went over to tom merwin s house merwin a ranchman in brown duck with a contemplative eye sat with his feet upon a table plaiting a rawhide quirt tom said longley leaning against the table you heard anything from ed yet not yet said merwin continuing his plaiting i guess ed ll be along back now in a few days there was a bank examiner said longley nosing around our place to day and he bucked a sight about that note of yours you know i know it s all right but the thing is against the banking laws i was pretty sure you d have paid it off before the bank was examined again but the son of a gun slipped in on us tom now i m short of cash myself just now or i d let you have the money to take it up with i ve got till twelve o clock to morrow and then i ve got to show the cash in place of that note or or what bill asked merwin as longley hesitated well i suppose it means be jumped on with both of uncle sam s feet i ll try to raise the money for you on time said merwin interested in his plaiting all right tom concluded longley as he turned toward the door i knew you would if you could merwin threw down his whip and went to the only other bank in town a private one run by cooper craig cooper he said to the partner by that name i ve got to have to day or to morrow i ve got a house and lot there that s worth about and that s all the actual collateral but i ve got a cattle deal on that s sure to bring me in more than that much profit within a few days cooper began to cough now for god s sake don t say no said merwin i owe that much money on a call loan it s been called and the man that called it is a man i ve laid on the same blanket with in cow camps and ranger camps for ten years he can call anything i ve got he can call the blood out of my veins and it ll come he s got to have the money he s in a devil of a well he needs the money and i ve got to get it for him you know my word s good cooper no doubt of it assented cooper urbanely but i ve a partner you know i m not free in making loans and even if you had the best security in your hands merwin we couldn t accommodate you in less than a week we re just making a shipment of to myer brothers in rockdell to buy cotton with it goes down on the narrow gauge to night that leaves our cash quite short at present sorry we can t arrange it for you merwin went back to his little bare office and plaited at his quirt again about four o clock in the afternoon he went to the first national bank and leaned over the railing of longley s desk i ll try to get that money for you to night i mean to morrow bill all right tom said longley quietly at nine o clock that night tom merwin stepped cautiously out of the small frame house in which he lived it was near the edge of the little town and few citizens were in the neighbourhood at that hour merwin wore two six shooters in a belt and a slouch hat he moved swiftly down a lonely street and then followed the sandy road that ran parallel to the narrow gauge track until he reached the water tank two miles below the town there tom merwin stopped tied a black silk handkerchief about the lower part of his face and pulled his hat down low in ten minutes the night train for rockdell pulled up at the tank having come from chaparosa with a gun in each hand merwin raised himself from behind a clump of chaparral and started for the engine but before he had taken three steps two long strong arms clasped him from behind and he was lifted from his feet and thrown face downward upon the grass there was a heavy knee pressing against his back and an iron hand grasping each of his wrists he was held thus like a child until the engine had taken water and until the train had moved with accelerating speed out of sight then he was released and rose to his feet to face bill longley the case never needed to be fixed up this way tom said longley i saw cooper this evening and he told me what you and him talked about then i went down to your house to night and saw you come out with your guns on and i followed you let s go back tom they walked away together side by side twas the only chance i saw said merwin presently you called your loan and i tried to answer you now what ll you do bill if they sock it to you what would you have done if they d socked it to you was the answer longley made i never thought i d lay in a bush to stick up a train remarked merwin but a call loan s different a call s a call with me we ve got twelve hours yet bill before this spy jumps onto you we ve got to raise them spondulicks somehow maybe we can great sam houston do you hear that merwin broke into a run and longley kept with him hearing only a rather pleasing whistle somewhere in the night rendering the lugubrious air of the cowboy s lament it s the only tune he knows shouted merwin as he ran i ll bet they were at the door of merwin s house he kicked it open and fell over an old valise lying in the middle of the floor a sunburned firm jawed youth stained by travel lay upon the bed puffing at a brown cigarette what s the word ed gasped merwin so so drawled that capable youngster just got in on the sold the bunch for fifteen straight now buddy you want to quit kickin a valise around that s got in greenbacks in its in ards the princess and the puma there had to be a king and queen of course the king was a terrible old man who wore six shooters and spurs and shouted in such a tremendous voice that the rattlers on the prairie would run into their holes under the prickly pear before there was a royal family they called the man whispering ben when he came to own acres of land and more cattle than he could count they called him o donnell the cattle king the queen had been a mexican girl from laredo she made a good mild colorado claro wife and even succeeded in teaching ben to modify his voice sufficiently while in the house to keep the dishes from being broken when ben got to be king she would sit on the gallery of espinosa ranch and weave rush mats when wealth became so irresistible and oppressive that upholstered chairs and a centre table were brought down from san antone in the wagons she bowed her smooth dark head and shared the fate of the danae to avoid lese majeste you have been presented first to the king and queen they do not enter the story which might be called the chronicle of the princess the happy thought and the lion that bungled his job josefa o donnell was the surviving daughter the princess from her mother she inherited warmth of nature and a dusky semi tropic beauty from ben o donnell the royal she acquired a store of intrepidity common sense and the faculty of ruling the combination was one worth going miles to see josefa while riding her pony at a gallop could put five out of six bullets through a tomato can swinging at the end of a string she could play for hours with a white kitten she owned dressing it in all manner of absurd clothes scorning a pencil she could tell you out of her head what two year olds would bring on the hoof at per head roughly speaking the espinosa ranch is forty miles long and thirty broad but mostly leased land josefa on her pony had prospected over every mile of it every cow puncher on the range knew her by sight and was a loyal vassal ripley givens foreman of one of the espinosa outfits saw her one day and made up his mind to form a royal matrimonial alliance presumptuous no in those days in the nueces country a man was a man and after all the title of cattle king does not presuppose blood royalty often it only signifies that its owner wears the crown in token of his magnificent qualities in the art of cattle stealing one day ripley givens rode over to the double elm ranch to inquire about a bunch of strayed yearlings he was late in setting out on his return trip and it was sundown when he struck the white horse crossing of the nueces from there to his own camp it was sixteen miles to the espinosa ranch it was twelve givens was tired he decided to pass the night at the crossing there was a fine water hole in the river bed the banks were thickly covered with great trees undergrown with brush back from the water hole fifty yards was a stretch of curly mesquite grass supper for his horse and bed for himself givens staked his horse and spread out his saddle blankets to dry he sat down with his back against a tree and rolled a cigarette from somewhere in the dense timber along the river came a sudden rageful shivering wail the pony danced at the end of his rope and blew a whistling snort of comprehending fear givens puffed at his cigarette but he reached leisurely for his pistol belt which lay on the grass and twirled the cylinder of his weapon tentatively a great gar plunged with a loud splash into the water hole a little brown rabbit skipped around a bunch of catclaw and sat twitching his whiskers and looking humorously at givens the pony went on eating grass it is well to be reasonably watchful when a mexican lion sings soprano along the arroyos at sundown the burden of his song may be that young calves and fat lambs are scarce and that he has a carnivorous desire for your acquaintance in the grass lay an empty fruit can cast there by some former sojourner givens caught sight of it with a grunt of satisfaction in his coat pocket tied behind his saddle was a handful or two of ground coffee black coffee and cigarettes what ranchero could desire more in two minutes he had a little fire going clearly he started with his can for the water hole when within fifteen yards of its edge he saw between the bushes a side saddled pony with down dropped reins cropping grass a little distance to his left just rising from her hands and knees on the brink of the water hole was josefa o donnell she had been drinking water and she brushed the sand from the palms of her hands ten yards away to her right half concealed by a clump of sacuista givens saw the crouching form of the mexican lion his amber eyeballs glared hungrily six feet from them was the tip of the tail stretched straight like a pointer s his hind quarters rocked with the motion of the cat tribe preliminary to leaping givens did what he could his six shooter was thirty five yards away lying on the grass he gave a loud yell and dashed between the lion and the princess the rucus as givens called it afterward was brief and somewhat confused when he arrived on the line of attack he saw a dim streak in the air and heard a couple of faint cracks then a hundred pounds of mexican lion plumped down upon his head and flattened him with a heavy jar to the ground he remembered calling out let up now no fair gouging and then he crawled from under the lion like a worm with his mouth full of grass and dirt and a big lump on the back of his head where it had struck the root of a water elm the lion lay motionless givens feeling aggrieved and suspicious of fouls shook his fist at the lion and shouted i ll rastle you again for twenty and then he got back to himself josefa was standing in her tracks quietly reloading her silver mounted it had not been a difficult shot the lion s head made an easier mark than a tomato can swinging at the end of a string there was a provoking teasing maddening smile upon her mouth and in her dark eyes the would be rescuing knight felt the fire of his fiasco burn down to his soul here had been his chance the chance that he had dreamed of and momus and not cupid had presided over it the satyrs in the wood were no doubt holding their sides in hilarious silent laughter there had been something like vaudeville say signor givens and his funny knockabout act with the stuffed lion is that you mr givens said josefa in her deliberate saccharine contralto you nearly spoilt my shot when you yelled did you hurt your head when you fell oh no said givens quietly that didn t hurt he stooped ignominiously and dragged his best stetson hat from under the beast it was crushed and wrinkled to a fine comedy effect then he knelt down and softly stroked the fierce open jawed head of the dead lion poor old bill he exclaimed mournfully what s that asked josefa sharply of course you didn t know miss josefa said givens with an air of one allowing magnanimity to triumph over grief nobody can blame you i tried to save him but i couldn t let you know in time save who why bill i ve been looking for him all day you see he s been our camp pet for two years poor old fellow he wouldn t have hurt a cottontail rabbit it ll break the boys all up when they hear about it but you couldn t tell of course that bill was just trying to play with you josefa s black eyes burned steadily upon him ripley givens met the test successfully he stood rumpling the yellow brown curls on his head pensively in his eye was regret not unmingled with a gentle reproach his smooth features were set to a pattern of indisputable sorrow josefa wavered what was your pet doing here she asked making a last stand there s no camp near the white horse crossing the old rascal ran away from camp yesterday answered givens readily it s a wonder the coyotes didn t scare him to death you see jim webster our horse wrangler brought a little terrier pup into camp last week the pup made life miserable for bill he used to chase him around and chew his hind legs for hours at a time every night when bedtime came bill would sneak under one of the boy s blankets and sleep to keep the pup from finding him i reckon he must have been worried pretty desperate or he wouldn t have run away he was always afraid to get out of sight of camp josefa looked at the body of the fierce animal givens gently patted one of the formidable paws that could have killed a yearling calf with one blow slowly a red flush widened upon the dark olive face of the girl was it the signal of shame of the true sportsman who has brought down ignoble quarry her eyes grew softer and the lowered lids drove away all their bright mockery i m very sorry she said humbly but he looked so big and jumped so high that poor old bill was hungry interrupted givens in quick defence of the deceased we always made him jump for his supper in camp he would lie down and roll over for a piece of meat when he saw you he thought he was going to get something to eat from you suddenly josefa s eyes opened wide i might have shot you she exclaimed you ran right in between you risked your life to save your pet that was fine mr givens i like a man who is kind to animals yes there was even admiration in her gaze now after all there was a hero rising out of the ruins of the anti climax the look on givens s face would have secured him a high position in the s p c a i always loved em said he horses dogs mexican lions cows alligators i hate alligators instantly demurred josefa crawly muddy things did i say alligators said givens i meant antelopes of course josefa s conscience drove her to make further amends she held out her hand penitently there was a bright unshed drop in each of her eyes please forgive me mr givens won t you i m only a girl you know and i was frightened at first i m very very sorry i shot bill you don t know how ashamed i feel i wouldn t have done it for anything givens took the proffered hand he held it for a time while he allowed the generosity of his nature to overcome his grief at the loss of bill at last it was clear that he had forgiven her please don t speak of it any more miss josefa twas enough to frighten any young lady the way bill looked i ll explain it all right to the boys are you really sure you don t hate me josefa came closer to him impulsively her eyes were sweet oh sweet and pleading with gracious penitence i would hate anyone who would kill my kitten and how daring and kind of you to risk being shot when you tried to save him how very few men would have done that victory wrested from defeat vaudeville turned into drama bravo ripley givens it was now twilight of course miss josefa could not be allowed to ride on to the ranch house alone givens resaddled his pony in spite of that animal s reproachful glances and rode with her side by side they galloped across the smooth grass the princess and the man who was kind to animals the prairie odours of fruitful earth and delicate bloom were thick and sweet around them coyotes yelping over there on the hill no fear and yet josefa rode closer a little hand seemed to grope givens found it with his own the ponies kept an even gait the hands lingered together and the owner of one explained i never was frightened before but just think how terrible it would be to meet a really wild lion poor bill i m so glad you came with me o donnell was sitting on the ranch gallery hello rip he shouted that you he rode in with me said josefa i lost my way and was late much obliged called the cattle king stop over rip and ride to camp in the morning but givens would not he would push on to camp there was a bunch of steers to start off on the trail at daybreak he said good night and trotted away an hour later when the lights were out josefa in her night robe came to her door and called to the king in his own room across the brick paved hallway say pop you know that old mexican lion they call the gotch eared devil the one that killed gonzales mr martin s sheep herder and about fifty calves on the salado range well i settled his hash this afternoon over at the white horse crossing put two balls in his head with my while he was on the jump i knew him by the slice gone from his left ear that old gonzales cut off with his machete you couldn t have made a better shot yourself daddy bully for you thundered whispering ben from the darkness of the royal chamber the indian summer of dry valley johnson dry valley johnson shook the bottle you have to shake the bottle before using for sulphur will not dissolve then dry valley saturated a small sponge with the liquid and rubbed it carefully into the roots of his hair besides sulphur there was sugar of lead in it and tincture of nux vomica and bay rum dry valley found the recipe in a sunday newspaper you must next be told why a strong man came to fall a victim to a beauty hint dry valley had been a sheepman his real name was hector but he had been rechristened after his range to distinguish him from elm creek johnson who ran sheep further down the frio many years of living face to face with sheep on their own terms wearied dry valley johnson so he sold his ranch for eighteen thousand dollars and moved to santa rosa to live a life of gentlemanly ease being a silent and melancholy person of thirty five or perhaps thirty eight he soon became that cursed and earth cumbering thing an elderlyish bachelor with a hobby some one gave him his first strawberry to eat and he was done for dry valley bought a four room cottage in the village and a library on strawberry culture behind the cottage was a garden of which he made a strawberry patch in his old grey woolen shirt his brown duck trousers and high heeled boots he sprawled all day on a canvas cot under a live oak tree at his back door studying the history of the seductive scarlet berry the school teacher miss de witt spoke of him as a fine presentable man for all his middle age but the focus of dry valley s eyes embraced no women they were merely beings who flew skirts as a signal for him to lift awkwardly his heavy round crowned broad brimmed felt stetson whenever he met them and then hurry past to get back to his beloved berries and all this recitative by the chorus is only to bring us to the point where you may be told why dry valley shook up the insoluble sulphur in the bottle so long drawn and inconsequential a thing is history the anamorphous shadow of a milestone reaching down the road between us and the setting sun when his strawberries were beginning to ripen dry valley bought the heaviest buggy whip in the santa rosa store he sat for many hours under the live oak tree plaiting and weaving in an extension to its lash when it was done he could snip a leaf from a bush twenty feet away with the cracker for the bright predatory eyes of santa rosa youth were watching the ripening berries and dry valley was arming himself against their expected raids no greater care had he taken of his tender lambs during his ranching days than he did of his cherished fruit warding it from the hungry wolves that whistled and howled and shot their marbles and peered through the fence that surrounded his property in the house next to dry valley s lived a widow with a pack of children that gave the husbandman frequent anxious misgivings in the woman there was a strain of the spanish she had wedded one of the name of o brien dry valley was a connoisseur in cross strains and he foresaw trouble in the offspring of this union between the two homesteads ran a crazy picket fence overgrown with morning glory and wild gourd vines often he could see little heads with mops of black hair and flashing dark eyes dodging in and out between the pickets keeping tabs on the reddening berries late one afternoon dry valley went to the post office when he came back like mother hubbard he found the deuce to pay the descendants of iberian bandits and hibernian cattle raiders had swooped down upon his strawberry patch to the outraged vision of dry valley there seemed to be a sheep corral full of them perhaps they numbered five or six between the rows of green plants they were stooped hopping about like toads gobbling silently and voraciously his finest fruit dry valley slipped into the house got his whip and charged the marauders the lash curled about the legs of the nearest a greedy ten year old before they knew they were discovered his screech gave warning and the flock scampered for the fence like a drove of javelis flushed in the chaparral dry valley s whip drew a toll of two more elfin shrieks before they dived through the vine clad fence and disappeared dry valley less fleet followed them nearly to the pickets checking his useless pursuit he rounded a bush dropped his whip and stood voiceless motionless the capacity of his powers consumed by the act of breathing and preserving the perpendicular behind the bush stood panchita o brien scorning to fly she was nineteen the oldest of the raiders her night black hair was gathered back in a wild mass and tied with a scarlet ribbon she stood with reluctant feet yet nearer the brook than to the river for childhood had environed and detained her she looked at dry valley johnson for a moment with magnificent insolence and before his eyes slowly crunched a luscious berry between her white teeth then she turned and walked slowly to the fence with a swaying conscious motion such as a duchess might make use of in leading a promenade there she turned again and grilled dry valley johnson once more in the dark flame of her audacious eyes laughed a trifle school girlishly and twisted herself with pantherish quickness between the pickets to the o brien side of the wild gourd vine dry valley picked up his whip and went into his house he stumbled as he went up the two wooden steps the old mexican woman who cooked his meals and swept his house called him to supper as he went through the rooms dry valley went on stumbled down the front steps out the gate and down the road into a mesquite thicket at the edge of town he sat down in the grass and laboriously plucked the spines from a prickly pear one by one this was his attitude of thought acquired in the days when his problems were only those of wind and wool and water a thing had happened to the man a thing that if you are eligible you must pray may pass you by he had become enveloped in the indian summer of the soul dry valley had had no youth even his childhood had been one of dignity and seriousness at six he had viewed the frivolous gambols of the lambs on his father s ranch with silent disapproval his life as a young man had been wasted the divine fires and impulses the glorious exaltations and despairs the glow and enchantment of youth had passed above his head never a thrill of romeo had he known he was but a melancholy jaques of the forest with a ruder philosophy lacking the bitter sweet flavour of experience that tempered the veteran years of the rugged ranger of arden and now in his sere and yellow leaf one scornful look from the eyes of panchita o brien had flooded the autumnal landscape with a tardy and delusive summer heat but a sheepman is a hardy animal dry valley johnson had weathered too many northers to turn his back on a late summer spiritual or real old he would show them by the next mail went an order to san antonio for an outfit of the latest clothes colours and styles and prices no object the next day went the recipe for the hair restorer clipped from a newspaper for dry valley s sunburned auburn hair was beginning to turn silvery above his ears dry valley kept indoors closely for a week except for frequent sallies after youthful strawberry snatchers then a few days later he suddenly emerged brilliantly radiant in the hectic glow of his belated midsummer madness a jay bird blue tennis suit covered him outwardly almost as far as his wrists and ankles his shirt was ox blood his collar winged and tall his necktie a floating oriflamme his shoes a venomous bright tan pointed and shaped on penitential lasts a little flat straw hat with a striped band desecrated his weather beaten head lemon coloured kid gloves protected his oak tough hands from the benignant may sunshine this sad and optic smiting creature teetered out of its den smiling foolishly and smoothing its gloves for men and angels to see to such a pass had dry valley johnson been brought by cupid who always shoots game that is out of season with an arrow from the quiver of momus reconstructing mythology he had risen a prismatic macaw from the ashes of the grey brown phoenix that had folded its tired wings to roost under the trees of santa rosa dry valley paused in the street to allow santa rosans within sight of him to be stunned and then deliberately and slowly as his shoes required entered mrs o brien s gate not until the eleven months drought did santa rosa cease talking about dry valley johnson s courtship of panchita o brien it was an unclassifiable procedure something like a combination of cake walking deaf and dumb oratory postage stamp flirtation and parlour charades it lasted two weeks and then came to a sudden end of course mrs o brien favoured the match as soon as dry valley s intentions were disclosed being the mother of a woman child and therefore a charter member of the ancient order of the rat trap she joyfully decked out panchita for the sacrifice the girl was temporarily dazzled by having her dresses lengthened and her hair piled up on her head and came near forgetting that she was only a slice of cheese it was nice too to have as good a match as mr johnson paying you attentions and to see the other girls fluttering the curtains at their windows to see you go by with him dry valley bought a buggy with yellow wheels and a fine trotter in san antonio every day he drove out with panchita he was never seen to speak to her when they were walking or driving the consciousness of his clothes kept his mind busy the knowledge that he could say nothing of interest kept him dumb the feeling that panchita was there kept him happy he took her to parties and dances and to church he tried oh no man ever tried so hard to be young as dry valley did he could not dance but he invented a smile which he wore on these joyous occasions a smile that in him was as great a concession to mirth and gaiety as turning hand springs would be in another he began to seek the company of the young men in the town even of the boys they accepted him as a decided damper for his attempts at sportiveness were so forced that they might as well have essayed their games in a cathedral neither he nor any other could estimate what progress he had made with panchita the end came suddenly in one day as often disappears the false afterglow before a november sky and wind dry valley was to call for the girl one afternoon at six for a walk an afternoon walk in santa rosa was a feature of social life that called for the pink of one s wardrobe so dry valley began gorgeously to array himself and so early that he finished early and went over to the o brien cottage as he neared the porch on the crooked walk from the gate he heard sounds of revelry within he stopped and looked through the honeysuckle vines in the open door panchita was amusing her younger brothers and sisters she wore a man s clothes no doubt those of the late mr o brien on her head was the smallest brother s straw hat decorated with an ink striped paper band on her hands were flapping yellow cloth gloves roughly cut out and sewn for the masquerade the same material covered her shoes giving them the semblance of tan leather high collar and flowing necktie were not omitted panchita was an actress dry valley saw his affectedly youthful gait his limp where the right shoe hurt him his forced smile his awkward simulation of a gallant air all reproduced with startling fidelity for the first time a mirror had been held up to him the corroboration of one of the youngsters calling mamma come and see pancha do like mr johnson was not needed as softly as the caricatured tans would permit dry valley tiptoed back to the gate and home again twenty minutes after the time appointed for the walk panchita tripped demurely out of her gate in a thin trim white lawn and sailor hat she strolled up the sidewalk and slowed her steps at dry valley s gate her manner expressing wonder at his unusual delinquency then out of his door and down the walk strode not the polychromatic victim of a lost summertime but the sheepman rehabilitated he wore his old grey woolen shirt open at the throat his brown duck trousers stuffed into his run over boots and his white felt sombrero on the back of his head twenty years or fifty he might look dry valley cared not his light blue eyes met panchita s dark ones with a cold flash in them he came as far as the gate he pointed with his long arm to her house go home said dry valley go home to your mother i wonder lightnin don t strike a fool like me go home and play in the sand what business have you got cavortin around with grown men i reckon i was locoed to be makin a he poll parrot out of myself for a kid like you go home and don t let me see you no more why i done it will somebody tell me go home and let me try and forget it panchita obeyed and walked slowly toward her home saying nothing for some distance she kept her head turned and her large eyes fixed intrepidly upon dry valley s at her gate she stood for a moment looking back at him then ran suddenly and swiftly into the house old antonia was building a fire in the kitchen stove dry valley stopped at the door and laughed harshly i m a pretty looking old rhinoceros to be gettin stuck on a kid ain t i tonia said he not verree good thing agreed antonia sagely for too much old man to likee muchacha you bet it ain t said dry valley grimly it s dum foolishness and besides it hurts he brought at one armful the regalia of his aberration the blue tennis suit shoes hat gloves and all and threw them in a pile at antonia s feet give them to your old man said he to hunt antelope in just as the first star presided palely over the twilight dry valley got his biggest strawberry book and sat on the back steps to catch the last of the reading light he thought he saw the figure of someone in his strawberry patch he laid aside the book got his whip and hurried forth to see it was panchita she had slipped through the picket fence and was half way across the patch she stopped when she saw him and looked at him without wavering a sudden rage a humiliating flush of unreasoning wrath came over dry valley for this child he had made himself a motley to the view he had tried to bribe time to turn backward for himself he had been made a fool of at last he had seen his folly there was a gulf between him and youth over which he could not build a bridge even with yellow gloves to protect his hands and the sight of his torment coming to pester him with her elfin pranks coming to plunder his strawberry vines like a mischievous schoolboy roused all his anger i told you to keep away from here said dry valley go back to your home panchita moved slowly toward him dry valley cracked his whip go back home said dry valley savagely and play theatricals some more you d make a fine man you ve made a fine one of me she came a step nearer silent and with that strange defiant steady shine in her eyes that had always puzzled him now it stirred his wrath his whiplash whistled through the air he saw a red streak suddenly come out through her white dress above her knee where it had struck without flinching and with the same unchanging dark glow in her eyes panchita came steadily toward him through the strawberry vines dry valley s trembling hand released his whip handle when within a yard of him panchita stretched out her arms god kid stammered dry valley do you mean but the seasons are versatile and it may have been springtime after all instead of indian summer that struck dry valley johnson christmas by injunction cherokee was the civic father of yellowhammer yellowhammer was a new mining town constructed mainly of canvas and undressed pine cherokee was a prospector one day while his burro was eating quartz and pine burrs cherokee turned up with his pick a nugget weighing thirty ounces he staked his claim and then being a man of breadth and hospitality sent out invitations to his friends in three states to drop in and share his luck not one of the invited guests sent regrets they rolled in from the gila country from salt river from the pecos from albuquerque and phoenix and santa fe and from the camps intervening when a thousand citizens had arrived and taken up claims they named the town yellowhammer appointed a vigilance committee and presented cherokee with a watch chain made of nuggets three hours after the presentation ceremonies cherokee s claim played out he had located a pocket instead of a vein he abandoned it and staked others one by one luck had kissed her hand to him never afterward did he turn up enough dust in yellowhammer to pay his bar bill but his thousand invited guests were mostly prospering and cherokee smiled and congratulated them yellowhammer was made up of men who took off their hats to a smiling loser so they invited cherokee to say what he wanted me said cherokee oh grubstakes will be about the thing i reckon i ll prospect along up in the mariposas if i strike it up there i will most certainly let you all know about the facts i never was any hand to hold out cards on my friends in may cherokee packed his burro and turned its thoughtful mouse coloured forehead to the north many citizens escorted him to the undefined limits of yellowhammer and bestowed upon him shouts of commendation and farewells five pocket flasks without an air bubble between contents and cork were forced upon him and he was bidden to consider yellowhammer in perpetual commission for his bed bacon and eggs and hot water for shaving in the event that luck did not see fit to warm her hands by his campfire in the mariposas the name of the father of yellowhammer was given him by the gold hunters in accordance with their popular system of nomenclature it was not necessary for a citizen to exhibit his baptismal certificate in order to acquire a cognomen a man s name was his personal property for convenience in calling him up to the bar and in designating him among other blue shirted bipeds a temporary appellation title or epithet was conferred upon him by the public personal peculiarities formed the source of the majority of such informal baptisms many were easily dubbed geographically from the regions from which they confessed to have hailed some announced themselves to be thompsons and adamses and the like with a brazenness and loudness that cast a cloud upon their titles a few vaingloriously and shamelessly uncovered their proper and indisputable names this was held to be unduly arrogant and did not win popularity one man who said he was chesterton l c belmont and proved it by letters was given till sundown to leave the town such names as shorty bow legs texas lazy bill thirsty rogers limping riley the judge and california ed were in favour cherokee derived his title from the fact that he claimed to have lived for a time with that tribe in the indian nation on the twentieth day of december baldy the mail rider brought yellowhammer a piece of news what do i see in albuquerque said baldy to the patrons of the bar but cherokee all embellished and festooned up like the czar of turkey and lavishin money in bulk him and me seen the elephant and the owl and we had specimens of this seidlitz powder wine and cherokee he audits all the bills c o d his pockets looked like a pool table s after a fifteen ball run cherokee must have struck pay ore remarked california ed well he s white i m much obliged to him for his success seems like cherokee would ramble down to yellowhammer and see his friends said another slightly aggrieved but that s the way prosperity is the finest cure there is for lost forgetfulness you wait said baldy i m comin to that cherokee strikes a three foot vein up in the mariposas that assays a trip to europe to the ton and he closes it out to a syndicate outfit for a hundred thousand hasty dollars in cash then he buys himself a baby sealskin overcoat and a red sleigh and what do you think he takes it in his head to do next chuck a luck said texas whose ideas of recreation were the gamester s come and kiss me ma honey sang shorty who carried tintypes in his pocket and wore a red necktie while working on his claim bought a saloon suggested thirsty rogers cherokee took me to a room continued baldy and showed me he s got that room full of drums and dolls and skates and bags of candy and jumping jacks and toy lambs and whistles and such infantile truck and what do you think he s goin to do with them inefficacious knick knacks don t surmise none cherokee told me he s goin to lead em up in his red sleigh and wait a minute don t order no drinks yet he s goin to drive down here to yellowhammer and give the kids the kids of this here town the biggest christmas tree and the biggest cryin doll and little giant boys tool chest blowout that was ever seen west of the cape hatteras two minutes of absolute silence ticked away in the wake of baldy s words it was broken by the house who happily conceiving the moment to be ripe for extending hospitality sent a dozen whisky glasses spinning down the bar with the slower travelling bottle bringing up the rear didn t you tell him asked the miner called trinidad well no answered baldy pensively i never exactly seen my way to you see cherokee had this christmas mess already bought and paid for and he was all flattered up with self esteem over his idea and we had in a way flew the flume with that fizzy wine i speak of so i never let on i cannot refrain from a certain amount of surprise said the judge as he hung his ivory handled cane on the bar that our friend cherokee should possess such an erroneous conception of ah his as it were own town oh it ain t the eighth wonder of the terrestrial world said baldy cherokee s been gone from yellowhammer over seven months lots of things could happen in that time how s he to know that there ain t a single kid in this town and so far as emigration is concerned none expected come to think of it remarked california ed it s funny some ain t drifted in town ain t settled enough yet for to bring in the rubber ring brigade i reckon to top off this christmas tree splurge of cherokee s went on baldy he s goin to give an imitation of santa claus he s got a white wig and whiskers that disfigure him up exactly like the pictures of this william cullen longfellow in the books and a red suit of fur trimmed outside underwear and eight ounce gloves and a stand up lay down croshayed red cap ain t it a shame that a outfit like that can t get a chance to connect with a annie and willie s prayer layout when does cherokee allow to come over with his truck inquired trinidad mornin before christmas said baldy and he wants you folks to have a room fixed up and a tree hauled and ready and such ladies to assist as can stop breathin long enough to let it be a surprise for the kids the unblessed condition of yellowhammer had been truly described the voice of childhood had never gladdened its flimsy structures the patter of restless little feet had never consecrated the one rugged highway between the two rows of tents and rough buildings later they would come but now yellowhammer was but a mountain camp and nowhere in it were the roguish expectant eyes opening wide at dawn of the enchanting day the eager small hands to reach for santa s bewildering hoard the elated childish voicings of the season s joy such as the coming good things of the warm hearted cherokee deserved of women there were five in yellowhammer the assayer s wife the proprietress of the lucky strike hotel and a laundress whose washtub panned out an ounce of dust a day these were the permanent feminines the remaining two were the spangler sisters misses fanchon and erma of the transcontinental comedy company then playing in repertoire at the improvised empire theatre but of children there were none sometimes miss fanchon enacted with spirit and address the part of robustious childhood but between her delineation and the visions of adolescence that the fancy offered as eligible recipients of cherokee s holiday stores there seemed to be fixed a gulf christmas would come on thursday on tuesday morning trinidad instead of going to work sought the judge at the lucky strike hotel it ll be a disgrace to yellowhammer said trinidad if it throws cherokee down on his christmas tree blowout you might say that that man made this town for one i m goin to see what can be done to give santa claus a square deal my co operation said the judge would be gladly forthcoming i am indebted to cherokee for past favours but i do not see i have heretofore regarded the absence of children rather as a luxury but in this instance still i do not see look at me said trinidad and you ll see old ways and means with the fur on i m goin to hitch up a team and rustle a load of kids for cherokee s santa claus act if i have to rob an orphan asylum eureka cried the judge enthusiastically no you didn t said trinidad decidedly i found it myself i learned about that latin word at school i will accompany you declared the judge waving his cane perhaps such eloquence and gift of language as i possess will be of benefit in persuading our young friends to lend themselves to our project within an hour yellowhammer was acquainted with the scheme of trinidad and the judge and approved it citizens who knew of families with offspring within a forty mile radius of yellowhammer came forward and contributed their information trinidad made careful notes of all such and then hastened to secure a vehicle and team the first stop scheduled was at a double log house fifteen miles out from yellowhammer a man opened the door at trinidad s hail and then came down and leaned upon the rickety gate the doorway was filled with a close mass of youngsters some ragged all full of curiosity and health it s this way explained trinidad we re from yellowhammer and we come kidnappin in a gentle kind of a way one of our leading citizens is stung with the santa claus affliction and he s due in town to morrow with half the folderols that s painted red and made in germany the youngest kid we got in yellowhammer packs a forty five and a safety razor consequently we re mighty shy on anybody to say oh and ah when we light the candles on the christmas tree now partner if you ll loan us a few kids we guarantee to return em safe and sound on christmas day and they ll come back loaded down with a good time and swiss family robinsons and cornucopias and red drums and similar testimonials what do you say in other words said the judge we have discovered for the first time in our embryonic but progressive little city the inconveniences of the absence of adolescence the season of the year having approximately arrived during which it is a custom to bestow frivolous but often appreciated gifts upon the young and tender i understand said the parent packing his pipe with a forefinger i guess i needn t detain you gentlemen me and the old woman have got seven kids so to speak and runnin my mind over the bunch i don t appear to hit upon none that we could spare for you to take over to your doin s the old woman has got some popcorn candy and rag dolls hid in the clothes chest and we allow to give christmas a little whirl of our own in a insignificant sort of style no i couldn t with any degree of avidity seem to fall in with the idea of lettin none of em go thank you kindly gentlemen down the slope they drove and up another foothill to the ranch house of wiley wilson trinidad recited his appeal and the judge boomed out his ponderous antiphony mrs wiley gathered her two rosy cheeked youngsters close to her skirts and did not smile until she had seen wiley laugh and shake his head again a refusal trinidad and the judge vainly exhausted more than half their list before twilight set in among the hills they spent the night at a stage road hostelry and set out again early the next morning the wagon had not acquired a single passenger it s creepin upon my faculties remarked trinidad that borrowin kids at christmas is somethin like tryin to steal butter from a man that s got hot pancakes a comin it is undoubtedly an indisputable fact said the judge that the ah family ties seem to be more coherent and assertive at that period of the year on the day before christmas they drove thirty miles making four fruitless halts and appeals everywhere they found kids at a premium the sun was low when the wife of a section boss on a lonely railroad huddled her unavailable progeny behind her and said there s a woman that s just took charge of the railroad eatin house down at granite junction i hear she s got a little boy maybe she might let him go trinidad pulled up his mules at granite junction at five o clock in the afternoon the train had just departed with its load of fed and appeased passengers on the steps of the eating house they found a thin and glowering boy of ten smoking a cigarette the dining room had been left in chaos by the peripatetic appetites a youngish woman reclined exhausted in a chair her face wore sharp lines of worry she had once possessed a certain style of beauty that would never wholly leave her and would never wholly return trinidad set forth his mission i d count it a mercy if you d take bobby for a while she said wearily i m on the go from morning till night and i don t have time to tend to him he s learning bad habits from the men it ll be the only chance he ll have to get any christmas the men went outside and conferred with bobby trinidad pictured the glories of the christmas tree and presents in lively colours and moreover my young friend added the judge santa claus himself will personally distribute the offerings that will typify the gifts conveyed by the shepherds of bethlehem to aw come off said the boy squinting his small eyes i ain t no kid there ain t any santa claus it s your folks that buys toys and sneaks em in when you re asleep and they make marks in the soot in the chimney with the tongs to look like santa s sleigh tracks that might be so argued trinidad but christmas trees ain t no fairy tale this one s goin to look like the ten cent store in albuquerque all strung up in a redwood there s tops and drums and noah s arks and oh rats said bobby wearily i cut them out long ago i d like to have a rifle not a target one a real one to shoot wildcats with but i guess you won t have any of them on your old tree well i can t say for sure said trinidad diplomatically it might be you go along with us and see the hope thus held out though faint won the boy s hesitating consent to go with this solitary beneficiary for cherokee s holiday bounty the canvassers spun along the homeward road in yellowhammer the empty storeroom had been transformed into what might have passed as the bower of an arizona fairy the ladies had done their work well a tall christmas tree covered to the topmost branch with candles spangles and toys sufficient for more than a score of children stood in the centre of the floor near sunset anxious eyes had begun to scan the street for the returning team of the child providers at noon that day cherokee had dashed into town with his new sleigh piled high with bundles and boxes and bales of all sizes and shapes so intent was he upon the arrangements for his altruistic plans that the dearth of children did not receive his notice no one gave away the humiliating state of yellowhammer for the efforts of trinidad and the judge were expected to supply the deficiency when the sun went down cherokee with many wings and arch grins on his seasoned face went into retirement with the bundle containing the santa claus raiment and a pack containing special and undisclosed gifts when the kids are rounded up he instructed the volunteer arrangement committee light up the candles on the tree and set em to playin pussy wants a corner and king william when they get good and at it why old santa ll slide in the door i reckon there ll be plenty of gifts to go round the ladies were flitting about the tree giving it final touches that were never final the spangled sisters were there in costume as lady violet de vere and marie the maid in their new drama the miner s bride the theatre did not open until nine and they were welcome assistants of the christmas tree committee every minute heads would pop out the door to look and listen for the approach of trinidad s team and now this became an anxious function for night had fallen and it would soon be necessary to light the candles on the tree and cherokee was apt to make an irruption at any time in his kriss kringle garb at length the wagon of the child rustlers rattled down the street to the door the ladies with little screams of excitement flew to the lighting of the candles the men of yellowhammer passed in and out restlessly or stood about the room in embarrassed groups trinidad and the judge bearing the marks of protracted travel entered conducting between them a single impish boy who stared with sullen pessimistic eyes at the gaudy tree where are the other children asked the assayer s wife the acknowledged leader of all social functions ma am said trinidad with a sigh prospectin for kids at christmas time is like huntin in a limestone for silver this parental business is one that i haven t no chance to comprehend it seems that fathers and mothers are willin for their offsprings to be drownded stole fed on poison oak and et by catamounts days in the year but on christmas day they insists on enjoyin the exclusive mortification of their company this here young biped ma am is all that washes out of our two days manoeuvres oh the sweet little boy cooed miss erma trailing her de vere robes to centre of stage aw shut up said bobby with a scowl who s a kid you ain t you bet fresh brat breathed miss erma beneath her enamelled smile we done the best we could said trinidad it s tough on cherokee but it can t be helped then the door opened and cherokee entered in the conventional dress of saint nick a white rippling beard and flowing hair covered his face almost to his dark and shining eyes over his shoulder he carried a pack no one stirred as he came in even the spangler sisters ceased their coquettish poses and stared curiously at the tall figure bobby stood with his hands in his pockets gazing gloomily at the effeminate and childish tree cherokee put down his pack and looked wonderingly about the room perhaps he fancied that a bevy of eager children were being herded somewhere to be loosed upon his entrance he went up to bobby and extended his red mittened hand merry christmas little boy said cherokee anything on the tree you want they ll get it down for you won t you shake hands with santa claus there ain t any santa claus whined the boy you ve got old false billy goat s whiskers on your face i ain t no kid what do i want with dolls and tin horses the driver said you d have a rifle and you haven t i want to go home trinidad stepped into the breach he shook cherokee s hand in warm greeting i m sorry cherokee he explained there never was a kid in yellowhammer we tried to rustle a bunch of em for your swaree but this sardine was all we could catch he s a atheist and he don t believe in santa claus it s a shame for you to be out all this truck but me and the judge was sure we could round up a wagonful of candidates for your gimcracks that s all right said cherokee gravely the expense don t amount to nothin worth mentionin we can dump the stuff down a shaft or throw it away i don t know what i was thinkin about but it never occurred to my cogitations that there wasn t any kids in yellowhammer meanwhile the company had relaxed into a hollow but praiseworthy imitation of a pleasure gathering bobby had retreated to a distant chair and was coldly regarding the scene with ennui plastered thick upon him cherokee lingering with his original idea went over and sat beside him where do you live little boy he asked respectfully granite junction said bobby without emphasis the room was warm cherokee took off his cap and then removed his beard and wig say exclaimed bobby with a show of interest i know your mug all right did you ever see me before asked cherokee i don t know but i ve seen your picture lots of times where the boy hesitated on the bureau at home he answered let s have your name if you please buddy robert lumsden the picture belongs to my mother she puts it under her pillow of nights and once i saw her kiss it i wouldn t but women are that way cherokee rose and beckoned to trinidad keep this boy by you till i come back he said i m goin to shed these christmas duds and hitch up my sleigh i m goin to take this kid home well infidel said trinidad taking cherokee s vacant chair and so you are too superannuated and effete to yearn for such mockeries as candy and toys it seems i don t like you said bobby with acrimony you said there would be a rifle a fellow can t even smoke i wish i was at home cherokee drove his sleigh to the door and they lifted bobby in beside him the team of fine horses sprang away prancingly over the hard snow cherokee had on his overcoat of baby sealskin the laprobe that he drew about them was as warm as velvet bobby slipped a cigarette from his pocket and was trying to snap a match throw that cigarette away said cherokee in a quiet but new voice bobby hesitated and then dropped the cylinder overboard throw the box too commanded the new voice more reluctantly the boy obeyed say said bobby presently i like you i don t know why nobody never made me do anything i didn t want to do before tell me kid said cherokee not using his new voice are you sure your mother kissed that picture that looks like me dead sure i seen her do it didn t you remark somethin a while ago about wanting a rifle you bet i did will you get me one to morrow silver mounted cherokee took out his watch half past nine we ll hit the junction plumb on time with christmas day are you cold sit closer son a chaparral prince nine o clock at last and the drudging toil of the day was ended lena climbed to her room in the third half story of the quarrymen s hotel since daylight she had slaved doing the work of a full grown woman scrubbing the floors washing the heavy ironstone plates and cups making the beds and supplying the insatiate demands for wood and water in that turbulent and depressing hostelry the din of the day s quarrying was over the blasting and drilling the creaking of the great cranes the shouts of the foremen the backing and shifting of the flat cars hauling the heavy blocks of limestone down in the hotel office three or four of the labourers were growling and swearing over a belated game of checkers heavy odours of stewed meat hot grease and cheap coffee hung like a depressing fog about the house lena lit the stump of a candle and sat limply upon her wooden chair she was eleven years old thin and ill nourished her back and limbs were sore and aching but the ache in her heart made the biggest trouble the last straw had been added to the burden upon her small shoulders they had taken away grimm always at night however tired she might be she had turned to grimm for comfort and hope each time had grimm whispered to her that the prince or the fairy would come and deliver her out of the wicked enchantment every night she had taken fresh courage and strength from grimm to whatever tale she read she found an analogy in her own condition the woodcutter s lost child the unhappy goose girl the persecuted stepdaughter the little maiden imprisoned in the witch s hut all these were but transparent disguises for lena the overworked kitchenmaid in the quarrymen s hotel and always when the extremity was direst came the good fairy or the gallant prince to the rescue so here in the ogre s castle enslaved by a wicked spell lena had leaned upon grimm and waited longing for the powers of goodness to prevail but on the day before mrs maloney had found the book in her room and had carried it away declaring sharply that it would not do for servants to read at night they lost sleep and did not work briskly the next day can one only eleven years old living away from one s mamma and never having any time to play live entirely deprived of grimm just try it once and you will see what a difficult thing it is lena s home was in texas away up among the little mountains on the pedernales river in a little town called fredericksburg they are all german people who live in fredericksburg of evenings they sit at little tables along the sidewalk and drink beer and play pinochle and scat they are very thrifty people thriftiest among them was peter hildesmuller lena s father and that is why lena was sent to work in the hotel at the quarries thirty miles away she earned three dollars every week there and peter added her wages to his well guarded store peter had an ambition to become as rich as his neighbour hugo heffelbauer who smoked a meerschaum pipe three feet long and had wiener schnitzel and hassenpfeffer for dinner every day in the week and now lena was quite old enough to work and assist in the accumulation of riches but conjecture if you can what it means to be sentenced at eleven years of age from a home in the pleasant little rhine village to hard labour in the ogre s castle where you must fly to serve the ogres while they devour cattle and sheep growling fiercely as they stamp white limestone dust from their great shoes for you to sweep and scour with your weak aching fingers and then to have grimm taken away from you lena raised the lid of an old empty case that had once contained canned corn and got out a sheet of paper and a piece of pencil she was going to write a letter to her mamma tommy ryan was going to post it for her at ballinger s tommy was seventeen worked in the quarries went home to ballinger s every night and was now waiting in the shadows under lena s window for her to throw the letter out to him that was the only way she could send a letter to fredericksburg mrs maloney did not like for her to write letters the stump of the candle was burning low so lena hastily bit the wood from around the lead of her pencil and began this is the letter she wrote dearest mamma i want so much to see you and gretel and claus and heinrich and little adolf i am so tired i want to see you to day i was slapped by mrs maloney and had no supper i could not bring in enough wood for my hand hurt she took my book yesterday i mean grimm s fairy tales which uncle leo gave me it did not hurt any one for me to read the book i try to work as well as i can but there is so much to do i read only a little bit every night dear mamma i shall tell you what i am going to do unless you send for me to morrow to bring me home i shall go to a deep place i know in the river and drown it is wicked to drown i suppose but i wanted to see you and there is no one else i am very tired and tommy is waiting for the letter you will excuse me mamma if i do it your respectful and loving daughter lena tommy was still waiting faithfully when the letter was concluded and when lena dropped it out she saw him pick it up and start up the steep hillside without undressing she blew out the candle and curled herself upon the mattress on the floor at o clock old man ballinger came out of his house in his stocking feet and leaned over the gate smoking his pipe he looked down the big road white in the moonshine and rubbed one ankle with the toe of his other foot it was time for the fredericksburg mail to come pattering up the road old man ballinger had waited only a few minutes when he heard the lively hoofbeats of fritz s team of little black mules and very soon afterward his covered spring wagon stood in front of the gate fritz s big spectacles flashed in the moonlight and his tremendous voice shouted a greeting to the postmaster of ballinger s the mail carrier jumped out and took the bridles from the mules for he always fed them oats at ballinger s while the mules were eating from their feed bags old man ballinger brought out the mail sack and threw it into the wagon fritz bergmann was a man of three sentiments or to be more accurate four the pair of mules deserving to be reckoned individually those mules were the chief interest and joy of his existence next came the emperor of germany and lena hildesmuller tell me said fritz when he was ready to start contains the sack a letter to frau hildesmuller from the little lena at the quarries one came in the last mail to say that she is a little sick already her mamma is very anxious to hear again yes said old man ballinger thar s a letter for mrs helterskelter or some sich name tommy ryan brung it over when he come her little gal workin over thar you say in the hotel shouted fritz as he gathered up the lines eleven years old and not bigger as a frankfurter the close fist of a peter hildesmuller some day i shall with a big club pound that man s dummkopf all in and out the town perhaps in this letter lena will say that she is yet feeling better so her mamma will be glad auf wiedersehen herr ballinger your feets will take cold out in the night air so long fritzy said old man ballinger you got a nice cool night for your drive up the road went the little black mules at their steady trot while fritz thundered at them occasional words of endearment and cheer these fancies occupied the mind of the mail carrier until he reached the big post oak forest eight miles from ballinger s here his ruminations were scattered by the sudden flash and report of pistols and a whooping as if from a whole tribe of indians a band of galloping centaurs closed in around the mail wagon one of them leaned over the front wheel covered the driver with his revolver and ordered him to stop others caught at the bridles of donder and blitzen donnerwetter shouted fritz with all his tremendous voice wass ist release your hands from dose mules ve vas der united states mail hurry up dutch drawled a melancholy voice don t you know when you re in a stick up reverse your mules and climb out of the cart it is due to the breadth of hondo bill s demerit and the largeness of his achievements to state that the holding up of the fredericksburg mail was not perpetrated by way of an exploit as the lion while in the pursuit of prey commensurate to his prowess might set a frivolous foot upon a casual rabbit in his path so hondo bill and his gang had swooped sportively upon the pacific transport of meinherr fritz the real work of their sinister night ride was over fritz and his mail bag and his mules came as gentle relaxation grateful after the arduous duties of their profession twenty miles to the southeast stood a train with a killed engine hysterical passengers and a looted express and mail car that represented the serious occupation of hondo bill and his gang with a fairly rich prize of currency and silver the robbers were making a wide detour to the west through the less populous country intending to seek safety in mexico by means of some fordable spot on the rio grande the booty from the train had melted the desperate bushrangers to jovial and happy skylarkers trembling with outraged dignity and no little personal apprehension fritz climbed out to the road after replacing his suddenly removed spectacles the band had dismounted and were singing capering and whooping thus expressing their satisfied delight in the life of a jolly outlaw rattlesnake rogers who stood at the heads of the mules jerked a little too vigorously at the rein of the tender mouthed donder who reared and emitted a loud protesting snort of pain instantly fritz with a scream of anger flew at the bulky rogers and began to assiduously pummel that surprised freebooter with his fists villain shouted fritz dog bigstiff dot mule he has a soreness by his mouth i vill knock off your shoulders mit your head robbermans yi yi howled rattlesnake roaring with laughter and ducking his head somebody git this here sour krout off n me one of the band yanked fritz back by the coat tail and the woods rang with rattlesnake s vociferous comments the dog goned little wienerwurst he yelled amiably he s not so much of a skunk for a dutchman took up for his animile plum quick didn t he i like to see a man like his hoss even if it is a mule the dad blamed little limburger he went for me didn t he whoa now muley i ain t a goin to hurt your mouth agin any more perhaps the mail would not have been tampered with had not ben moody the lieutenant possessed certain wisdom that seemed to promise more spoils say cap he said addressing hondo bill there s likely to be good pickings in these mail sacks i ve done some hoss tradin with these dutchmen around fredericksburg and i know the style of the varmints there s big money goes through the mails to that town them dutch risk a thousand dollars sent wrapped in a piece of paper before they d pay the banks to handle the money hondo bill six feet two gentle of voice and impulsive in action was dragging the sacks from the rear of the wagon before moody had finished his speech a knife shone in his hand and they heard the ripping sound as it bit through the tough canvas the outlaws crowded around and began tearing open letters and packages enlivening their labours by swearing affably at the writers who seemed to have conspired to confute the prediction of ben moody not a dollar was found in the fredericksburg mail you ought to be ashamed of yourself said hondo bill to the mail carrier in solemn tones to be packing around such a lot of old trashy paper as this what d you mean by it anyhow where do you dutchers keep your money at the ballinger mail sack opened like a cocoon under hondo s knife it contained but a handful of mail fritz had been fuming with terror and excitement until this sack was reached he now remembered lena s letter he addressed the leader of the band asking that that particular missive be spared much obliged dutch he said to the disturbed carrier i guess that s the letter we want got spondulicks in it ain t it here she is make a light boys hondo found and tore open the letter to mrs hildesmuller the others stood about lighting twisted up letters one from another hondo gazed with mute disapproval at the single sheet of paper covered with the angular german script whatever is this you ve humbugged us with dutchy you call this here a valuable letter that s a mighty low down trick to play on your friends what come along to help you distribute your mail that s chiny writin said sandy grundy peering over hondo s shoulder you re off your kazip declared another of the gang an effective youth covered with silk handkerchiefs and nickel plating that s shorthand i see em do it once in court ach no no no dot is german said fritz it is no more as a little girl writing a letter to her mamma one poor little girl sick and vorking hard avay from home ach it is a shame good mr robberman you vill please let me have dot letter what the devil do you take us for old pretzels said hondo with sudden and surprising severity you ain t presumin to insinuate that we gents ain t possessed of sufficient politeness for to take an interest in the miss s health are you now you go on and you read that scratchin out loud and in plain united states language to this here company of educated society hondo twirled his six shooter by its trigger guard and stood towering above the little german who at once began to read the letter translating the simple words into english the gang of rovers stood in absolute silence listening intently how old is that kid asked hondo when the letter was done eleven said fritz and where is she at at dose rock quarries working ach mein gott little lena she speak of drowning i do not know if she vill do it but if she shall i schwear i vill dot peter hildesmuller shoot mit a gun you dutchers said hondo bill his voice swelling with fine contempt make me plenty tired hirin out your kids to work when they ought to be playin dolls in the sand you re a hell of a sect of people i reckon we ll fix your clock for a while just to show what we think of your old cheesy nation here boys hondo bill parleyed aside briefly with his band and then they seized fritz and conveyed him off the road to one side here they bound him fast to a tree with a couple of lariats his team they tied to another tree near by we ain t going to hurt you bad said hondo reassuringly twon t hurt you to be tied up for a while we will now pass you the time of day as it is up to us to depart ausgespielt nixcumrous dutchy don t get any more impatience fritz heard a great squeaking of saddles as the men mounted their horses then a loud yell and a great clatter of hoofs as they galloped pell mell back along the fredericksburg road for more than two hours fritz sat against his tree tightly but not painfully bound then from the reaction after his exciting adventure he sank into slumber how long he slept he knew not but he was at last awakened by a rough shake hands were untying his ropes he was lifted to his feet dazed confused in mind and weary of body rubbing his eyes he looked and saw that he was again in the midst of the same band of terrible bandits they shoved him up to the seat of his wagon and placed the lines in his hands hit it out for home dutch said hondo bill s voice commandingly you ve given us lots of trouble and we re pleased to see the back of your neck spiel zwei bier vamoose hondo reached out and gave blitzen a smart cut with his quirt the little mules sprang ahead glad to be moving again fritz urged them along himself dizzy and muddled over his fearful adventure according to schedule time he should have reached fredericksburg at daylight as it was he drove down the long street of the town at eleven o clock a m he had to pass peter hildesmuller s house on his way to the post office he stopped his team at the gate and called but frau hildesmuller was watching for him out rushed the whole family of hildesmullers frau hildesmuller fat and flushed inquired if he had a letter from lena and then fritz raised his voice and told the tale of his adventure he told the contents of that letter that the robber had made him read and then frau hildesmuller broke into wild weeping her little lena drown herself why had they sent her from home what could be done perhaps it would be too late by the time they could send for her now peter hildesmuller dropped his meerschaum on the walk and it shivered into pieces woman he roared at his wife why did you let that child go away it is your fault if she comes home to us no more every one knew that it was peter hildesmuller s fault so they paid no attention to his words a moment afterward a strange faint voice was heard to call mamma frau hildesmuller at first thought it was lena s spirit calling and then she rushed to the rear of fritz s covered wagon and with a loud shriek of joy caught up lena herself covering her pale little face with kisses and smothering her with hugs lena s eyes were heavy with the deep slumber of exhaustion but she smiled and lay close to the one she had longed to see there among the mail sacks covered in a nest of strange blankets and comforters she had lain asleep until wakened by the voices around her fritz stared at her with eyes that bulged behind his spectacles gott in himmel he shouted how did you get in that wagon am i going crazy as well as to be murdered and hanged by robbers this day you brought her to us fritz cried frau hildesmuller how can we ever thank you enough tell mamma how you came in fritz s wagon said frau hildesmuller i don t know said lena but i know how i got away from the hotel the prince brought me by the emperor s crown shouted fritz we are all going crazy i always knew he would come said lena sitting down on her bundle of bedclothes on the sidewalk last night he came with his armed knights and captured the ogre s castle they broke the dishes and kicked down the doors they pitched mr maloney into a barrel of rain water and threw flour all over mrs maloney the workmen in the hotel jumped out of the windows and ran into the woods when the knights began firing their guns they wakened me up and i peeped down the stair and then the prince came up and wrapped me in the bedclothes and carried me out he was so tall and strong and fine his face was as rough as a scrubbing brush and he talked soft and kind and smelled of schnapps he took me on his horse before him and we rode away among the knights he held me close and i went to sleep that way and didn t wake up till i got home rubbish cried fritz bergmann fairy tales how did you come from the quarries to my wagon the prince brought me said lena confidently and to this day the good people of fredericksburg haven t been able to make her give any other explanation the reformation of calliope calliope catesby was in his humours again ennui was upon him this goodly promontory the earth particularly that portion of it known as quicksand was to him no more than a pestilent congregation of vapours overtaken by the megrims the philosopher may seek relief in soliloquy my lady find solace in tears the flaccid easterner scold at the millinery bills of his women folk such recourse was insufficient to the denizens of quicksand calliope especially was wont to express his ennui according to his lights over night calliope had hung out signals of approaching low spirits he had kicked his own dog on the porch of the occidental hotel and refused to apologise he had become capricious and fault finding in conversation while strolling about he reached often for twigs of mesquite and chewed the leaves fiercely that was always an ominous act another symptom alarming to those who were familiar with the different stages of his doldrums was his increasing politeness and a tendency to use formal phrases a husky softness succeeded the usual penetrating drawl in his tones a dangerous courtesy marked his manners later his smile became crooked the left side of his mouth slanting upward and quicksand got ready to stand from under at this stage calliope generally began to drink finally about midnight he was seen going homeward saluting those whom he met with exaggerated but inoffensive courtesy not yet was calliope s melancholy at the danger point he would seat himself at the window of the room he occupied over silvester s tonsorial parlours and there chant lugubrious and tuneless ballads until morning accompanying the noises by appropriate maltreatment of a jangling guitar more magnanimous than nero he would thus give musical warning of the forthcoming municipal upheaval that quicksand was scheduled to endure a quiet amiable man was calliope catesby at other times quiet to indolence and amiable to worthlessness at best he was a loafer and a nuisance at worst he was the terror of quicksand his ostensible occupation was something subordinate in the real estate line he drove the beguiled easterner in buckboards out to look over lots and ranch property originally he came from one of the gulf states his lank six feet slurring rhythm of speech and sectional idioms giving evidence of his birthplace and yet after taking on western adjustments this languid pine box whittler cracker barrel hugger shady corner lounger of the cotton fields and sumac hills of the south became famed as a bad man among men who had made a life long study of the art of truculence at nine the next morning calliope was fit inspired by his own barbarous melodies and the contents of his jug he was ready primed to gather fresh laurels from the diffident brow of quicksand encircled and criss crossed with cartridge belts abundantly garnished with revolvers and copiously drunk he poured forth into quicksand s main street too chivalrous to surprise and capture a town by silent sortie he paused at the nearest corner and emitted his slogan that fearful brassy yell so reminiscent of the steam piano that had gained for him the classic appellation that had superseded his own baptismal name following close upon his vociferation came three shots from his forty five by way of limbering up the guns and testing his aim a yellow dog the personal property of colonel swazey the proprietor of the occidental fell feet upward in the dust with one farewell yelp a mexican who was crossing the street from the blue front grocery carrying in his hand a bottle of kerosene was stimulated to a sudden and admirable burst of speed still grasping the neck of the shattered bottle the new gilt weather cock on judge riley s lemon and ultramarine two story residence shivered flapped and hung by a splinter the sport of the wanton breezes the artillery was in trim calliope s hand was steady the high calm ecstasy of habitual battle was upon him though slightly embittered by the sadness of alexander in that his conquests were limited to the small world of quicksand down the street went calliope shooting right and left glass fell like hail dogs vamosed chickens flew squawking feminine voices shrieked concernedly to youngsters at large the din was perforated at intervals by the staccato of the terror s guns and was drowned periodically by the brazen screech that quicksand knew so well the occasions of calliope s low spirits were legal holidays in quicksand all along the main street in advance of his coming clerks were putting up shutters and closing doors business would languish for a space the right of way was calliope s and as he advanced observing the dearth of opposition and the few opportunities for distraction his ennui perceptibly increased but some four squares farther down lively preparations were being made to minister to mr catesby s love for interchange of compliments and repartee on the previous night numerous messengers had hastened to advise buck patterson the city marshal of calliope s impending eruption the patience of that official often strained in extending leniency toward the disturber s misdeeds had been overtaxed in quicksand some indulgence was accorded the natural ebullition of human nature providing that the lives of the more useful citizens were not recklessly squandered or too much property needlessly laid waste the community sentiment was against a too strict enforcement of the law but calliope had raised the limit his outbursts had been too frequent and too violent to come within the classification of a normal and sanitary relaxation of spirit buck patterson had been expecting and awaiting in his little ten by twelve frame office that preliminary yell announcing that calliope was feeling blue when the signal came the city marshal rose to his feet and buckled on his guns two deputy sheriffs and three citizens who had proven the edible qualities of fire also stood up ready to bandy with calliope s leaden jocularities gather that fellow in said buck patterson setting forth the lines of the campaign don t have no talk but shoot as soon as you can get a show keep behind cover and bring him down he s a nogood un it s up to calliope to turn up his toes this time i reckon go to him all spraddled out boys and don t git too reckless for what calliope shoots at he hits buck patterson tall muscular and solemn faced with his bright city marshal badge shining on the breast of his blue flannel shirt gave his posse directions for the onslaught upon calliope the plan was to accomplish the downfall of the quicksand terror without loss to the attacking party if possible the splenetic calliope unconscious of retributive plots was steaming down the channel cannonading on either side when he suddenly became aware of breakers ahead the city marshal and one of the deputies rose up behind some dry goods boxes half a square to the front and opened fire at the same time the rest of the posse divided shelled him from two side streets up which they were cautiously manoeuvring from a well executed detour the first volley broke the lock of one of calliope s guns cut a neat underbit in his right ear and exploded a cartridge in his crossbelt scorching his ribs as it burst feeling braced up by this unexpected tonic to his spiritual depression calliope executed a fortissimo note from his upper register and returned the fire like an echo the upholders of the law dodged at his flash but a trifle too late to save one of the deputies a bullet just above the elbow and the marshal a bleeding cheek from a splinter that a ball tore from the box he had ducked behind and now calliope met the enemy s tactics in kind choosing with a rapid eye the street from which the weakest and least accurate fire had come he invaded it at a double quick abandoning the unprotected middle of the street with rare cunning the opposing force in that direction one of the deputies and two of the valorous volunteers waited concealed by beer barrels until calliope had passed their retreat and then peppered him from the rear in another moment they were reinforced by the marshal and his other men and then calliope felt that in order to successfully prolong the delights of the controversy he must find some means of reducing the great odds against him his eye fell upon a structure that seemed to hold out this promise providing he could reach it not far away was the little railroad station its building a strong box house ten by twenty feet resting upon a platform four feet above ground windows were in each of its walls something like a fort it might become to a man thus sorely pressed by superior numbers calliope made a bold and rapid spurt for it the marshal s crowd smoking him as he ran he reached the haven in safety the station agent leaving the building by a window like a flying squirrel as the garrison entered the door patterson and his supporters halted under protection of a pile of lumber and held consultations in the station was an unterrified desperado who was an excellent shot and carried an abundance of ammunition for thirty yards on either side of the besieged was a stretch of bare open ground it was a sure thing that the man who attempted to enter that unprotected area would be stopped by one of calliope s bullets the city marshal was resolved he had decided that calliope catesby should no more wake the echoes of quicksand with his strident whoop he had so announced officially and personally he felt imperatively bound to put the soft pedal on that instrument of discord it played bad tunes standing near was a hand truck used in the manipulation of small freight it stood by a shed full of sacked wool a consignment from one of the sheep ranches on this truck the marshal and his men piled three heavy sacks of wool stooping low buck patterson started for calliope s fort slowly pushing this loaded truck before him for protection the posse scattering broadly stood ready to nip the besieged in case he should show himself in an effort to repel the juggernaut of justice that was creeping upon him only once did calliope make demonstration he fired from a window and some tufts of wool spurted from the marshal s trustworthy bulwark the return shots from the posse pattered against the window frame of the fort no loss resulted on either side the marshal was too deeply engrossed in steering his protected battleship to be aware of the approach of the morning train until he was within a few feet of the platform the train was coming up on the other side of it it stopped only one minute at quicksand what an opportunity it would offer to calliope he had only to step out the other door mount the train and away abandoning his breastwork buck with his gun ready dashed up the steps and into the room driving upon the closed door with one heave of his weighty shoulder the members of the posse heard one shot fired inside and then there was silence at length the wounded man opened his eyes after a blank space he again could see and hear and feel and think turning his eyes about he found himself lying on a wooden bench a tall man with a perplexed countenance wearing a big badge with city marshal engraved upon it stood over him a little old woman in black with a wrinkled face and sparkling black eyes was holding a wet handkerchief against one of his temples he was trying to get these facts fixed in his mind and connected with past events when the old woman began to talk there now great big strong man that bullet never tetched ye jest skeeted along the side of your head and sort of paralysed ye for a spell i ve heerd of sech things afore cun cussion is

t hardly think he d ever been a baby would ye this is my son sir half turning the old woman looked up at the standing man her worn face lighting with a proud and wonderful smile she reached out one veined and calloused hand and took one of her son s then smiling cheerily down at the prostrate man she continued to dip the handkerchief in the waiting room tin washbasin and gently apply it to his temple she had the benevolent garrulity of old age i ain t seen my son before she continued in eight years one of my nephews elkanah price he s a conductor on one of them railroads and he got me a

help sot you up i think i ll sit up now said the concussion patient i m feeling pretty fair by this time he sat somewhat weakly yet leaning against the wall he was a rugged man big boned and straight his eyes steady and keen seemed to linger upon the face of the man standing so still above him his look wandered often from the face he studied to the marshal s badge upon the other s breast yes yes you ll be all right said the old woman patting his arm if you don t get to cuttin up agin and havin folks shooting at you son told me about you sir while you was layin senseless on the floor don t you

you let me advise you sir not to do so no more be a good man and leave liquor alone and live peaceably and goodly keep away from bad company and work honest and sleep sweet the black mitted hand of the old pleader gently touched the breast of the man she addressed very earnest and candid her old worn face looked in her rusty black dress and antique bonnet she sat near the close of a long life and epitomised the experience of the world still the man to whom she spoke gazed above her head contemplating the silent son of the old mother what does the marshal say he asked does he believe the advice is good suppose the marshal speaks up and says if the talk s all right the tall man moved uneasily he fingered the badge on his breast for a moment and then he put an arm around the old woman and drew her close to him she smiled the unchanging mother smile of three score years and patted his big brown hand with her crooked mittened fingers while her son spake i says this he said looking squarely into the eyes of the other man that if i was in your place i d follow it if i was a drunken desp rate character without shame or hope i d follow it if i was in your place and you was in mine i d say marshal i m willin to swear if you ll give me the chance i ll quit the racket i ll drop the tanglefoot and the gun play and won t play hoss no more i ll be a good citizen and go to work and

place and said that and i was marshal i d say go free and do your best to keep your promise lawsy exclaimed the old woman in a sudden flutter ef i didn t clear forget that trunk of mine i see a man

comin in she never had heard a word bout my tough ways i didn t have the nerve to let her know i was a worthless cuss bein hunted down by the community there you was lyin where my shot laid you like

republic died by his own hand in the coast town of coralio that he had reached thus far in flight from the inconveniences of an imminent revolution and that one hundred thousand dollars government funds which he carried with him in an american leather valise as a souvenir of his tempestuous administration was never afterward recovered for a real a boy will show you his grave it is back of the town near a little bridge that spans a mangrove swamp a plain slab of wood stands at its head some one has burned upon the headstone with a hot iron this inscription ramon angel de las cruzes y miraflores presidente de la republica de anchuria que sea su juez dios it is characteristic of this buoyant people that they pursue no man beyond the grave let god be his judge even with the hundred thousand unfound though they greatly coveted the hue and cry went no further than that to the stranger or the guest the people of coralio will relate the story of the tragic end of their former president how he strove to escape from the country with the publice funds and also with dona isabel guilbert the young american opera singer and how being apprehended by members of the opposing political party in coralio he shot himself through the head rather than give up the funds and in consequence the senorita guilbert they will relate further that dona isabel her adventurous bark of fortune shoaled by the simultaneous loss of her distinguished admirer and the souvenir hundred thousand dropped anchor on this stagnant coast awaiting a rising tide they say in coralio that she found a prompt and prosperous tide in the form of frank goodwin an american resident of the town an investor who had grown wealthy by dealing in the products of the country a banana king a rubber prince a sarsaparilla indigo and mahogany baron the senorita guilbert you will be told married senor goodwin one month after the president s death thus in the very moment when fortune had ceased to smile wresting from her a gift greater than the prize withdrawn of the american don frank goodwin and of his wife the natives have nothing but good to say don frank has lived among them for years and has compelled their respect his lady is easily queen of what social life the sober coast affords the wife of the governor of the district herself who was of the proud castilian family of monteleon y dolorosa de los santos y mendez feels honored to unfold her napkin with olive hued ringed hands at the table of senora goodwin were you to refer with your northern prejudices to the vivacious past of mrs goodwin when her audacious and gleeful abandon in light opera captured the mature president s fancy or to her share in that statesman s downfall and malfeasance the latin shrug of the shoulder would be your only answer and rebuttal what prejudices there were in coralio concerning senora goodwin seemed now to be in her favor whatever they had been in the past it would seem that the story is ended instead of begun that the close of tragedy and the climax of a romance have covered the ground of interest but to the more curious reader it shall be some slight instruction to trace the close threads that underlie the ingenious web of circumstances the headpiece bearing the name of president miraflores is daily scrubbed with soap bark and sand an old half breed indian tends the grave with fidelity and the dawdling minuteness of inherited sloth he chops down the weeds and ever springing grass with his machete he plucks ants and scorpions and beetles from it with his horny fingers and sprinkles its turf with water from the plaza fountain there is no grave anywhere so well kept and ordered only by following out the underlying threads will it be made clear why the old indian galves is secretly paid to keep green the grave of president miraflores by one who never saw that unfortunate statesman in life or in death and why that one was wont to walk in the twilight casting from a distance looks of gentle sadness upon that unhonored mound elsewhere than at coralio one learns of the impetuous career of isabel guilbert new orleans gave her birth and the mingled french and spanish creole nature that tinctured her life with such turbulence and warmth she had little education but a knowledge of men and motives that seemed to have come by instinct far beyond the common woman was she endowed with intrepid rashness with a love for the pursuit of adventure to the brink of danger and with desire for the pleasures of life her spirit was one to chafe under any curb she was eve after the fall but before the bitterness of it was felt she wore life as a rose in her bosom of the legion of men who had been at her feet it was said that but one was so fortunate as to engage her fancy to president miraflores the brilliant but unstable ruler of anchuria she yielded the key to her resolute heart how then do we find her as the coralians would have told you the wife of frank goodwin and happily living a life of dull and dreamy inaction the underlying threads reach far stretching across the sea following them out it will be made plain why shorty o day of the columbia detective agency resigned his position and for a lighter pastime it shall be a duty and a pleasing sport to wander with momus beneath the tropic stars where melpomene once stalked austere now to cause laughter to echo from those lavish jungles and frowing crags where formerly rang the cries of pirate s victims to lay aside pike and cutlass and attack with quip and jollity to draw one saving titter of mirth from the rusty casque of romance this were pleasant to do in the shade of the lemon trees on that coast that is curved like lips set for smiling for there are yet tales of the spanish main that segment of continent washed by the tempestuous caribbean and presenting to the sea a formidable border of tropicle jungle topped by the overweening cordilleras is still begirt by mystery and romance in past times buccaneers and revolutionists roused the echoes of its cliffs and the condor wheeled perpetually above where in the green groves they made food for him with their matchlocks and toledos taken and retaken by sea rovers by adverse powers and by sudden uprising of rebellious factions the historic miles of adventurous coast has scarcely known for hundreds of years whom rightly to call its master pizarro balboa sir francis drake and bolivar did what they could to make it a part of christendom sir john morgan lafitte and other eminent swashbucklers bombarded and pounded it in the name of abaddon the game still goes on the guns of the rovers are silenced but the tintype man the enlarged photograph brigand the kodaking tourist and the scouts of the gentle brigade of fakirs have found it out and carry on the work the hucksters of germany france and sicily now bag in small change across their counters gentlemen adventurers throng the waiting rooms of its rulers with proposals for railways and concessions the little opera bouffe nations play at government and intrigue until some day a big silent gunboat glides into the offing and warns them not to break their toys and with these changes comes also the small adventurer with empty pockets to fill light of heart busy brained the modern fairy prince bearing an alarm clock with which more surely than by the sentimental kiss to awaken the beautiful tropics from their centuries sleep generally he wears a shamrock which he matches pridefully against the extravagant palms and it is he who had driven melpomene to the wings and set comedy to dancing before the footlights of the southern cross so there is a little tale to tell of many things perhaps to the promiscuous ear of the walrus it shall come with most avail for in it there are indeed shoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbage palms and presidents instead of kings add to these a little love and counterplotting and scatter everywhere throughout the maze a trail of tropical dollars dollars warmed no more by the torrid sun than by the hot palms of the scouts of fortune and after all here seems to be life itself with talk enough to weary the most garrulous of walruses i fox in the morning coralio reclined in the mid day heat like some vacuous beauty lounging in a guarded harem the town lay at the sea s edge on a strip of alluvial coast it was set like a little pearl in an emerald band behind it and seeming almost to topple imminent above it rose the sea following range of the cordilleras in front the sea was spread a smiling jailer but even more incorruptible than the frowning mountains the waves swished along the smooth beach the parrots screamed in the orange and ceiba trees the palms waved their limber fronds foolishly like an awkward chorus at the prima donna s cue to enter suddenly the town was full of excitement a native boy dashed down a grass grown street shrieking busca el senor goodwin ha venido un telegrafo por el the word passed quickly telegrams do not come to any one in coralio the cry for senor goodwin was taken up by a dozen officious voices the main street running parallel to the beach became populated with those who desired to expedite the delivery of the dispatch knots of women with complexions varying from palest olive to deepest brown gathered at street corners and plaintively carolled un telegrafo por senor goodwin the comandante don senor el coronel encarnacion rios who was loyal to the ins and suspected goodwin s devotion to the outs hissed aha and wrote in his secret memorandum book the accusive fact that senor goodwin had on that momentous date received a telegram in the midst of the hullabaloo a man stepped to the door of a small wooden building and looked out above the door was a sign that read keogh and clancy a nomenclature that seemed not to be indigenous to that tropical soil the man in the door was billy keogh scout of fortune and progress and latter day rover of the spanish main tintypes and photographs were the weapons with which keogh and clancy were at that time assailing the hopeless shores outside the shop were set two large frames filled with specimens fo their art and skill keogh leaned in the doorway his bold and humorous countenance wearing a look of interest at the unusual influx of life and sound in the street when the meaning of the disturbance became clear to him he placed a hand beside his mouth and shouted hey frank in such a robustious voice that the feeble clamor of the natives was drowned and silenced fifty yards away on the seaward side of the street stood the abode of the consul for the united states out from the door of this building tumbled goodwin at the call he had been smoking with willard geddie the consul on the back porch of the consulate which was conceded to be the coolest spot in coralio hurry up shouted keogh there s a riot in town on account of a telegram that s come for you you want to be careful about these things my boy it won t do to trifle with the feelings of the public this way you ll be getting a pink note some day with violet scent on it and then the country ll be steeped in the throes of a revolution goodwin had strolled up the street and met the boy with the message the ox eyed women gazed at him with shy admiration for his type drew them he was big blond and jauntily dressed in white linen with buckskin zapatos his manner was courtly with a merciful eye when the telegram had been delivered and the bearer of it dismissed with a gratuity the relieved populace returned to the contiguities of shade from which curiosity had drawn it the women to their baking in the mud ovens under the orange trees or to the interminable combing of their long straight hair the men to their cigarettes and gossip in the cantinas goodwin sat on keogh s doorstep and read his telegram it was from bob englehart an american who lived in san mateo the capital city of anchuria eighty miles in the interior englehart was a gold miner an ardent revolutionist and good people that he was a man of resource and imagination was proven by the telegram he had sent it had had been his task to send a confidential message to his friend in coralio this could not have been accomplished in either spanish or english for the eye politic in anchuria was an active one but englehart was a diplomatist there existed but one code upon which he might make requisition with promise of safety the great and potent code of slang so here is the message that slipped unconstrued through the fingers of curious officials and came to the eye of goodwin his nibs skedaddled yesterday per jack rabbit line with all the coin in the kitty and the bundle of muslin he s spoony about the boodle is six figures short our crowd in good shape but we need the spondulicks you collar it the main guy and the dry goods are headed for the briny you to know what to do bob this screed remarkable as it was had no mystery for goodwin he was the most successful of the small advance guard of speculative americans that had invaded anchuria and he had not reached that enviable pinnacle without having well exercised the arts of foresight and deduction he had taken up political intrigue as a matter of business he was acute enough to wield a certain influence among the leading schemers and he was prosperous enough to be able to purchase the respect of the petty officeholders there was always a revolutionary party and to it he had allied himself for the adherents of a new administration received the rewards of their labors there was now a liberal party seeking to overturn president miraflores if the wheel successfully revolved goodwin stood to win a concession to manzanas of the finest coffee lands in the interior certain incidents in the recent career of president miraflores had excited a shrewd suspicion in goodwin s mind that the government was near a dissolution from another cause than that of a revolution and now englehart s telegram had come as a corroboration of his wisdom the telegram which had remained unintelligible to the anchurian linguists who had applied to it in vain their knowledge of spanish and elemental english conveyed a stimulating piece of news to goodwin s understanding it informed him that the president of the republic had decamped from the capital city with the contents of the treasury furthermore that he was accompanied in his flight by that winning adventuress isabel guilbert the opera singer whose troupe of performers had been entertained by the president at san mateo during the past month on a scale less modest than that with which royal visitors are often content the reference to the jackrabbit line could mean nothing else than the mule back system of transport that prevailed between coralio and the capital the hint that the boodle was six figures short made the condition of the national treasury lamentably clear also it was convincingly true that the ingoing party its way now made a pacific one would need the spondulicks unless its pledges should be fulfilled and the spoils held for the delectation of the victors precarious indeed would be the position of the new government therefore it was exceeding necessary to collar the main guy and recapture the sinews of war and government goodwin handed the message to keogh read that billy he said it s from bob englehart can you manage the cipher keogh sat in the other half of the doorway and carefully perused the telegram tis not a cipher he said finally tis what they call literature and that s a system of language put in the mouths of people that they ve never been introduced to by writers of imagination the magazines invented it but i never knew before that president norvin green had stamped it with the seal of his approval tis now no longer literature but language the dictionaries tried but they couldn t make it go for anything but dialect sure now that the western union indorses it it won t be long till a race of people will spring up that speaks it you re running too much to philology billy said goodwin do you make out the meaning of it sure replied the philosopher of fortune all languages come easy to the man who must know em i ve even failed to misunderstand an order to evacuate in classical chinese when it was backed up by the muzzle of a breech loader this little literary essay i hold in my hands means a game of fox in the morning ever play that frank when you was a kid i think so said goodwin laughing you join hands all round and you do not interrupted keogh you ve got a fine sporting game mixed up in your head with all around the rosebush the spirit of fox in the morning is opposed to the holding of hands i ll tell you how it s played this president man and his companion in play they stand up over in san mateo ready for the run and shout fox in the morning me and you standing here we say goose and gander they say how many miles is it to london town we say only a few if your legs are long enough how many comes out they say more than you re able to catch and then the game commences i catch the idea said goodwin it won t do to let the goose and gander slip through your fingers billy their feathers are too valuable our crowd is prepared and able to step into the shoes of the government at once but with the treasury empty we d stay in power about as long as a tenderfoot would stick on an untamed bronco we must play the fox on every foot of the coast to prevent their getting out of the country by the mule back schedule said keogh it s five days down from san mateo we ve got plenty of time to set our outposts there s only three places on the coast where they can hope to sail from here and solitas and alazan they re the only points we ll have to guard it s as easy as a chess problem fox to play and mate in three moves oh goosey goosey gander whither do you wander by the blessing of the literary telegraph the boodle of this benighted fatherland shall be preserved to the honest political party that is seeking to overthrow it the situation had been justly outlined by keogh the down trail from the capital was at all times a weary road to travel a jiggety joggety journey it was ice cold and hot wet and dry the trail climbed appalling mountains wound like a rotten string about the brows of breathless precipices plunged through chilling snow fed streams and wriggled like a snake through sunless forests teeming with menacing insect and animal life after descending to the foothills it turned to a trident the central prong ending at alazan another branched off to coralio the third penetrated to solitas between the sea and the foothills stretched the five miles breadth of alluvial coast here was the flora ofthe tropics in its rankest and most prodigal growth spaces here and there had been wrested from the jungle and planted with bananas and cane and orange groves the rest was a riot of wild vegetation the home of monkeys tapirs jaguars alligators and prodigious reptiles and insects where no road was cut a serpent could scarcely make its way through the tangle of vines and creepers across the treacherous mangrove swamps few things without wings could safely pass therefore the fugitives could hope to reach the coast only by one of the routes named keep the matter quiet billy advised goodwin we don t want the ins to know that the president is in flight i suppose bob s information is something of a scoop in the capital as yet otherwise he would not have tried to make his message a confidential one and besides everybody would have heard the news i m going around now to see dr zavalla and start a man up the trail to cut the telegraph wire as goodwin rose keogh threw his hat upon the grass by the door and expelled a tremendous sigh what s the trouble billy asked goodwin pausing that s the first time i heard you sigh tis the last said keogh with that sorrowful puff of wind i resign myself to a life of praiseworthy but harassing honesty what are tintypes if you please to the opportunities of the great and hilarious class of ganders and geese not that i would be a president frank and the boodle he s got is too big for me to handle but in some ways i feel my conscience hurting me for addicting myself to photographing a nation instead of running away with it frank did you ever see the bundle of muslin that his excellency has wrapped up and carried off isabel guilbert said goodwin laughing no i never did from what i ve heard of her though i imagine that she wouldn t stick at anything to carry her point don t get romantic billy sometimes i begin to fear that there s irish blood in your ancestry i never saw her either went on keogh but they say she s got all the ladies of mythology sculpture and fiction reduced to chromos they say she can look at a man once and he ll turn monkey and climb trees to pick coconuts for her think of that president man with lord know how many hundreds of thousands of dollars in one hand and this muslin siren in the other galloping down the hill on a sympathetic mule amid songbirds and flowers and here is billy keogh because he is virtuous condemned to the unprofitable swindle of slandering the faces of missing links on tin for an honest living tis an injustice of nature cheer up said goodwin you are a pretty poor fox to be envying a gander maybe the enchanting guilbert will take a fancy to you and your tintypes after we impoverish her royal escort she could do worse reflected keogh but she won t tis not a tintype gallery but a gallery of the gods that she s fitted to adorn she s a very wicked lady and the president man is in luck but i hear clancy swearing in the back room for having to do all the work and keogh plunged for the rear of the gallery whistling gaily in a spontaneous way that belied his recent sigh over the questionable good luck of the flying president goodwin turned from the main street into a much narrower one that intersected it at a right angle these side streets were covered by a growth of thick rank grass which was kept to a navigable shortness by the machetes of the police stone sidewalks little more than a ledge in width ran along the base of the mean and monotonous adobe houses at the outskirts of the village these streets dwindled to nothing and here were set the palm thatched huts of the caribs and the poorer natives and the shabby cabins of negroes from jamaica and the west india islands a few structures raised their heads above the red tiled roofs of the one story houses the bell tower of the calaboza the hotel de los extranjeros the residence of the vesuvius fruit company s agent the store and residence of bernard brannigan a ruined cathedral in which columbus had once set foot and most imposing of all the casa morena the summer white house of the president of anchuria on the principal street running along the beach the broadway of coralio were the larger stores the government bodega and post office the cuartel the rum shops and the market place on his way goodwin passed the house of bernard brannigan it was a modern wooden building two stories in height the ground floor was occupied by brannigan s store the upper one contained the living apartments a wide cool porch ran around the house half way up its outer walls a handsome vivacious girl neatly dressed in flowing white leaned over the railing and smiled down upon goodwin she was no darker than many an andalusian of high descent and she sparkled and glowed like a tropical moonlight good evening miss paula said goodwin taking off his hat with his ready smile there was little difference in his manner whether he addressed women or men everybody in coralio liked to receive the salutation of the big american is there any news mr goodwin please don t say no isn t it warm i feel just like mariana in her moated grange or was it a range it s hot enough no there s no news to tell i believe said goodwin with a mischievous look in his eye except that old geddie is getting grumpier and crosser every day if something doesn t happen to relieve his mind i ll have to quit smoking on his back porch and there s no other place available that is cool enough he isn t grumpy said paula brannigan impulsively when he but she ceased suddenly and drew back with a deepening color for her mother had been a mestizo lady and the spanish blood had brought to paula a certain shyness that was an adornment to the other half of her demonstrative nature ii the lotus and the bottle willard greddie consul for the united states in coralio was working leisurely on his yearly report goodwin who had strolled in as he did daily for a smoke on the much coveted porch had found him so absorbed in his work that he departed after roundly abusing the consul for his lack of hospitality i shall complain to the civil service department said goodwin or is it a department perhaps it s only a theory one gets neither civility nor service from you you won t talk and you won t set out anything to drink what kind of a way is that of representing your government goodwin strolled out and across to the hotel to see if he could bully the quarantine doctor into a game on coralio s solitary billiard table his plans were completed for the interception of the fugitives from the capital and now it was but a waiting game that he had to play the consul was interested in his report he was only twenty four and he had not been in coralio long enough for his enthusiasm to cool in the heat of the tropics a paradox that may be allowed between cancer and capricorn so many thousand bunches of bananas so mnay thousand oranges and coconuts so many ounces of gold dust pounds of rubber coffee indigo and sarparilla actually exports were twenty per cent greater than for the previous year a little thrill of satisfaction ran through the consul perhaps he thought the state department upon reading his introduction would notice and then he leaned back in his chair and laughed he was getting as bad as the others for the moment he had forgotten that coralio was an insignificant republic lying along the by ways of a second rate sea he thought of gregg the quarantine doctor who subscribed for the london lancet expecting to find it quoting his reports to the home board of health concerning the yellow fever germ the consul knew that not one in fifty of his acquaintances in the states had ever heard of coralio he knew that two men at any rate would have to read his report some underling in the state department and a compositor in the public printing office perhaps the typesticker would note the increase of commerce in coralio and speak of it over the cheese and beer to a friend he had just written most unaccountable is the supineness of the large exporters in the united states in permitting the french and german houses to practically control the trade interests of this rich and productive country when he heard the hoarse notes of a steamer s siren geddie laid down his pen and gathered his panama hat and umbrella by the sound he knew it to be the valhalla one of the line of fruit vessels plying for the vesuvius company down to ninos of five years every one in coralio could name you each incoming steamer by the note of her siren the consul sauntered by a roundabout shaded way to the beach by reason of long practice he gauged his stroll so accurately that by the time he arrived on the sandy shore the boat of the customs officials was rowing back from the steamer which had been boarded and inspected according to the laws of anchuria there is no harbor at coralio vessels of the draught of the valhalla must ride at anchor a mile from shore when they take on fruit it is conveyed on lighters and freighter sloops at solitas where there was a fine harbor ships of many kinds were to be seen but in the roadstead off coralio scarcely any save the fruiters paused now and then a tramp coaster or a mysterious brig from spain and then a tramp coaster or a mysterious brig from spain or a saucy french barque would hang innocently for a few days in the offing then the custom house crew would become doubly vigilant and wary at night a sloop or two would be making strange trips in and out along the shore and in the morning the stock of three star hennessey wines and drygoods in coralio would be found vastly increased it has also been said that the customs officials jingled more silver in the pockets of their red striped trousers and that the record books showed no increase in import duties received the custom s boat and the valhalla gig reached the shore at the same time when they grounded in the shallow water there was still five yards of rolling surf between them and dry sand then half clothed caribs dashed into the water and brought in on their backs the valhalla s purser and the little native officials in their cotton undershirts blue trousers with red stripes and flapping straw hats at college geddie had been a treasure as a first baseman he now closed his umbrella stuck it upright in the sand and stooped with his hands resting upon his knees the purser burlesquing the pitcher s contortions hurled at the consul the heavy roll of newspapers tied with a string that the steamer always brought for him geddie leaped high and caught the roll with a sounding thwack the loungers on the beach about a third of the population of the town laughed and applauded delightedly every week they expected to see that roll of papers delivered and received in that same manner and they were never disappointed innovations did not flourish in coralio the consul re hoisted his umbrella and walked back to the consulate this home of a great nation s representative was a wooden structure of two rooms with a native built gallery of poles bamboo and nipa palm running on three sides of it one room was the official apartment furnished chastely with a flat top desk a hammock and three uncomfortable cane seated chairs engravings of the first and latest president of the country represented hung against the wall the other room was the consul s living apartment it was eleven o clock when he returned from the beach and therefore breakfast time chanca the carib woman who cooked for him was just serving the meal on the side of the gallery facing the sea a spot famous as the coolest in coralio the breakfast consisted of shark s fin soup stew of land crabs breadfruit a boiled iguana steak aquacates a freshly cut pineapple claret and coffee geddie took his seat and unrolled with luxurious laziness his bundle of newspapers here in coralio for two days or longer he would read the goings on in the world very much as we of the world read those whimsical contributions to inexact science that assume to portray the doings of the martians after he had finished with the papers they would be sent on the rounds of the other english speaking residents of the town the paper that came first to his hand was one of those bulky mattresses of printed stuff upon which the readers of certain new york journals are supposed to take their sabbath literary nap opening this the consul rested it upon the table supporting its weight with the aid of the back of a chair then he partook of his meal deliberately turning the leaves from time to time and glancing half idly at the contents presently he was struck by something familiar to him in a picture a half page badly printed reproduction of a photograph of a vessel languidly interested he leaned for a nearer scrutiny and a view of the florid headlines of the column next to the picture yes he was not mistaken the engraving was of the eight hundred ton yacht idalia belonging to that prince of good fellows midas of the money market and society s pink of perfection j ward tolliver slowly sipping his black coffee geddie read the column of print following a listed statement of mr tolliver s real estate and bonds came a description of the yacht s furnishings and then the grain of news no bigger than a mustard seed mr tolliver with a party of favored guests would sail the next day on a six weeks cruise along the central american and south american coasts and among the bahama islands among the guests were mrs cumberland payne and miss ida payne of norfolk the writer with the fatuous presumption that was demanded of him by his readers had concocted a romance suited to their palates he bracketed the names of miss payne and mr tolliver until he had well nigh read the marriage ceremony over them he played coyly and insinuatingly upon the strings of on dit and madame rumor and a little bird and no one would be surprised and ended with congratulations geddie having finished his breakfast took his papers to the edge of the gallery and sat there in his favorite steamer chair with his feet on the bamboo railing he lighted a cigar and looked out upon the sea he felt a glow of satisfaction at finding he was so little disturbed by what he had read he told himself that he had conquered the distress that had sent him a voluntary exile to this far land of the lotus he could never forget ida of course but there was no longer any pain in thinking about her when they had had that misunderstanding and quarrel he had impulsively sought this consulship with the desire to retaliate upon her by detaching himself from her world and presence he had succeeded thoroughly in that during the twelve months of his life in coralio no word had passed between them though he had sometimes heard of her through the dilatory correspondence with the few friends to whom he still wrote still he could not repress a little thrill of satisfaction at knowing that she had not yet married tolliver or any one else but evidently tolliver had not yet abandoned hope well it made no difference to him now he had eaten of the lotus he was happy and content in this land of perpetual afternoon those old days of life in the states seemed like an irritating dream he hoped ida would be as happy as he was the climate as balmy as that of distant avalon the fetterless idyllic round of enchanted days the life among this indolent romantic people a life full of music flowers and low laughter the influence of the imminent sea and mountains and the many shapes of love and magic and beauty that bloomed in the white tropic nights with all he was more than content also there was paula brannigan geddie intended to marry paula if of course she would consent but he felt rather sure that she would do that somehow he kept postponing his proposal several times he had been quite near to it but a mysterious something always held him back perhaps it was only the unconscious instinctive conviction that the act would sever the last tie that bound him to his old world he could be very happy with paula few of the native girls could be compared with her she had attended a convent school in new orleans for two years and when she chose to display her accomplishments no one could detect any difference between her and the girls of norfolk and manhattan but it was delicious to see her at home dressed as she sometimes was in the native costume with bare shoulders and flowing sleeves bernard brannigan was the great merchant of coralio besides his store he maintained a train of pack mules and carried on a lively trade with the interior towns and villages he had married a native lady of high castilian descent but with a tinge of indian brown showing through her olive cheek the union of the irish and the spanish had produced as it so often has an offshoot of rare beauty and variety they were very excellent people indeed and the upper story of the house was ready to be placed at the service of geddie and paula as soon as he should make up his mind to speak about it by the time two hours were whiled away the consul tired of reading the papers lay scattered about him on the gallery reclining there he gazed dreamily out upon an eden a clump of banana plants interposed their broad shields between him and the sun the gentle slope from the consulate to the sea was covered with the dark green foliage of lemon trees and orange trees just bursting into bloom a lagoon pierced the land like a dark jagged crystal and above it a pale ceiba tree rose almost to the clouds the waving coconut palms on the beach flared their decorative green leaves against the slate of an almost quiescent sea his senses were cognizant of brilliant scarlet and ochres and the vert of the coppice of odors of fruit and bloom and the smoke from chanca s clay oven under the calabash tree of the treble laughter of the native women in their huts the song of the robin the salt taste of the breeze the diminuendo of the faint surf running along the shore and gradually of a white speck growing to a blur that intruded itself upon the drab prospect of the sea lazily interested he watched this blur increase until it became the idalia steaming at full speed coming down the coast without changing his position he kept his eyes upon the beautiful white yacht as she drew swiftly near and came opposite to coralio then sitting upright he saw her float steadily past and on he had seen the frequent splash of her polished brass work and the stripes of her deck awnings so much and no more like a ship on a magic lantern slide the idalia had crossed the illuminated circle of the consul s little world and was gone save for the tiny cloud of smoke that was left hanging over the brim of the sea she might have been an immaterial thing a chimera of his idle brain geddie went into his office and sat down to dawdle over his report if the reading of the article in the paper had left him unshaken this silent passing of the idalia had done for him still more it had brought the calm and peace of a situation from which all uncertainty had been erased he knew that men sometimes hope without being aware of it now since she had come two thousand miles and had passed without a sign not even his unconscious self need cling to the past any longer after dinner when the sun was low behind the mountains geddie walked on the little strip of beach under the coconuts the wind was blowing mildly landward and the surface of the sea was rippled by tiny wavelets a miniature breaker spreading with a soft swish upon the sand brought with its something round and shiny that rolled back again as the wave receded the next influx beached it clear and geddie picked it up the thing was a long necked wine bottle of colorless glass the cork had been driven in tightly to the level of the mouth and the end covered with dark red sealing wax the bottle contained only what seemed to be a sheet of paper much curled from the manipulation it had undergone while being inserted in the sealing wax was the impression of a seal probably of a signet ring bearing the initials of a monogram but the impression had been hastily made and the letters were past anything more certain than a shrewd conjecture ida payne had always worn a signet ring in preference to any other finger decoration geddie thought he could make out the familiar i p and a queer sensation of disquietude went over him more personal and intimate was this reminder of her than had been the sight of the vessel she was doubtless on he walked back to his house and set the bottle on his desk throwing off his hat and coat and lighting a lamp for the night had crowded precipitately upon the brief twilight he began to examine his piece of sea salvage by holding the bottle near the light and turning it judiciously he made out that it contained a double sheet of note paper filled with close writing further that the paper was of the same size and shade as that always used by ida and that to the best of his belief the handwriting was hers the imperfect glass of the bottle so distorted the rays of light that he could read no word of the writing but certain capital letters of which he caught comprehensive glimpses were ida s he felt sure there was a little smile both of perplexity and amusement in geddie s eyes as he set the bottle down and laid three cigars side by side on his desk he fetched his steamer chair from the gallery and stretched himself comfortably he would smoke those three cigars while considering the problem for it amounted to a problem he almost wished that he had not found the bottle but the bottle was there why should it have drifted in from the sea whence come so many disquieting things to disturb his peace in this dreamy land where time seemed so redundant he had fallen into the habit of bestowing much thought upon even trifling matters he bagan to speculate upon many fanciful theories concerning the story of the bottle rejecting each in turn ships in danger of wreck or disablement sometimes cast forth such precarious messengers calling for aid but he had seen the idalia not three hours before safe and speeding suppose the crew had mutinied and imprisoned the passengers below and the message was one begging for succor but premising such an improbable outrage would the agitated captives have taken the pains to fill four pages of note paper with carefully penned arguments to their rescue thus by elimination he soon rid the matter of the more unlikely theories and was reduced though aversely to the less assailable ones that the bottle contained a message to himself ida knew he was in coralio she must have launched the bottle while the yacht was passing and the wind blowing fairly toward the shore as soon as geddie reached this conclusion a wrinkle came between his brows and a stubborn look settled around his mouth he sat looking out through the doorway at the gigantic fire flies traversing the quiet streets if this was a message to him from ida what could it mean save an overture at reconciliation and if that why had she not used the same methods of the post instead of this uncertain and even flippant means of communication a note in an empty bottle cast into the sea there was something light and frivolous about it if not actually contemptuous the thought stirred his pride and subdued whatever emotions had been resurrected by the finding of the bottle geddie put on his coat and hat and walked out he followed a street that led him along the border of the little plaza where a band was playing and people were rambling care free and indolent some timorous senoritas scurrying past with fire flies tangled in the jetty braids of their hair glanced at him with shy flattering eyes the air was languorous with the scent of jasmin and orange blossoms the consul stayed his steps at the house of bernard brannigan paula was swinging in a hammock on the gallery she rose from it like a bird from its nest the color came to her cheeck at the sound of geddie s voice he was charmed at the sight of her costume a flounced muslin dress with a little jacket of white flannel all made with neatness and style he suggested a stroll and they walked out to the old indian well on the hill road they sat on the curb and there geddie made the expected but long deferred speech certain though he had been that she would not say him nay he was still thrilled at the completeness and sweetness of her surrender here was surely a heart made for love and steadfastness here was no caprice or questionings or captious standards of convention when geddie kissed paula at her door that night he was happier than he had ever been before here in this hollow lotus land ever to live and lie reclined seemed to him as it has seemed to many mariners the best as well as the easiest his future would be an ideal one he had attained a paradise without a serpent his eve would be indeed a part of him unbeguiled and therefore more beguiling he had made his decision tonight and his heart was full of serene assured content geddie went back to his house whistling that finest and saddest love song la golondrina at the door his tame monkey leaped down from his shelf chattering briskly the consul turned to his desk to get him some nuts he usually kept there reaching in the half darkness his hand struck against the bottle he started as if he had touched the cold rotundity of a serpent he had forgotten that the bottle was there he lighted the lamp and fed the monkey then very deliberately he lighted a cigar and took the bottle in his hand and walked down the path to the beach there was a moon and the sea was glorious the breeze had shifted as it did each evening and was now rushing steadily seaward stepping to the water s edge geddie hurled the unopened bottle far out into the sea it disappeared for a moment and then shot upward twice its length geddie stood still watching it the moonlight was so bright that he could see it bobbing up and down with the little waves slowly it receded from the shore flashing and turning as it went the wind was carrying it out to sea soon it became a mere speck doubtfully discerned at irregular intervals and then the mystery of it was swallowed up by the greater mystery of the ocean geddie stood still upon the beach smoking and looking out upon the water simon oh simon wake up there simon bawled a sonorous voice at the edge of the water old simon cruz was a half breed fisherman and smuggler who lived in a hut on the beach out of his earliest nap simon was thus awakened he slipped on his shoes and went outside just landing from one of the valhalla s boats was the third mate of that vessel who was an acquaintance of simon s and three sailors from the fruiter go up simon called the mate and find doctor gregg or mr goodwin or anybody that s a friend to mr geddie and bring em here at once saints of the skies said simon sleepily nothing has happened to mr geddie he s under that tarpauling said the mate pointing to the boat and he s rather more than half drowned we seen him from the steamer nearly a mile out from shore swimmin like mad after a bottle that was floatin in the water outward bound we lowered the gig and started for him he nearly had his hand on the bottle when he gave out and went under we pulled him out in time to save him maybe but the doctor is the one to decide that a bottle said the old man rubbing his eyes he was not yet fully awake where is the bottle driftin along out there some eres said the mate jerking his thumb toward the sea get on with you simon iii smith goodwin and the ardent patriot zavalla took all the precautions that their foresight could contrive to prevent the escape of president miraflores and his companion the sent trusted messengers up the coast to solitas and alazan to warn the local leaders of the flight and to instruct them to patrol the water line and arrest the fugitives at all hazards should they reveal themselves in that territory after this was done there remained only to cover the district about coralio and await the coming of the quarry the nets were well spread the roads were so few the opportunities for embarkation so limited and the two or three probable points of exit so well guarded that it would be strange indeed if there should slip through the meshes so much of the country s dignity romance and collateral the president would without doubt move as secretly as possible and endeavor to board a vessel by stealth from some secluded point along the shore on the fourth day after the receipt of englehart s telegram the karlsefin a norwegian steamer chartered by the new orleans fruit trade anchored off coralio with three horse toots of her siren the karlesfin ws not one of the line operated by the vesuvius fruit company she was something of a dilettante doing odd jobs for a company that was scarcely important enough to figure as a rival to the vesuvius the movements of the karlesfin were dependent upon the state of the market sometimes she would ply steadily between the spanish main and new orleans in the regular transport of fruit next she would be maing erratic trips to mobile or charleston or even as far north as new york according to the distribution of the fruit supply goodwin lounged upon the beach with the susual crowd of idlers that had gathered to view the steamer now that president miraflores might be expected to reach the borders of his abjured country at any time the orders were to keep a strict and unrelenting watch every vessel that approached the shores might now be considered a possible means of escape for the fugitives and an eye was kept even on the slopes and dories that belonged to the sea going contingent of coralio goodwin and zavalla moved everywhere but without ostentation watching the loopholes of escape the customs official crowded importantly into their boat and rowed out to the karlesfin a boat from the steamer landed her purser with his papers and took out the quarantine doctor with his green umbrella and clinical thermometer next a swarm of caribs began to load upon lighters the thousands of bunches of bananas heaped upon the shore and row them out to the steamer the karlesfin had no passenger list and was soon done with the attention of the authorities the purser declared that the steamer would remain at anchor until morning taking on her fruit during the night the karlesfin had come he said from new york to which port her latest load of oranges and coconuts had been conveyed two or three of the freighter sloops were engaged to assist in the work for the captain was anxious to make a quick return in order to reap the advantage offered by a certain dearth of fruit in the states about four o clock in the afternoon another of those marine monsters not very familiar in those waters hove in sight following the fateful idalia a graceful steam yacht painted a light buff clean cut as a steel engraving the beautiful vessel hovered off shore see sawing the waves as lightly as a duck in a rain barrel a swift boat manned by a crew in uniform came ashore and a stocky built man leaped to the sands the newcomer seemed to turn a disapproving eye upon the rather motley congregation of native anchurians and made his way at once toward goodwin who was the most conspicuously anglo saxon figure present goodwin greeted him with courtesy conversation developed that the newly landed one was named smith and that he had come in a yacht a meagre biography truly for the yacht was most apparent and the smith not beyond a reasonable guess before the revelation yet to the eye of goodwin who has seen several things there was a discrepancy between smith and his yacht a bullet headed man smith was with an oblique dead eye and the moustache of a cocktail mixer and unless he had shifted costumes before putting off for shore he had affronted the deck of his correct vessel clad in a pearl gray derby a gay plaid suit and vaudeville neckwear men owning pleasure yachts generally harmonize better with them smith looked business but he was no advertiser he commented upon the scenery remarking upon its fidelity to the pictures in the geography and then inquired for the united states consul goodwin pointed out the starred and striped bunting hanging from above the little consulate which was concealed behind the orange trees mr geddie the consul will be sure to be there said goodwin he was very nearly drowned a few days ago while taking a swim in the sea and the doctor has ordered him to remain indoors for some time smith ploughed his way through the sand to the consulate his haberdashery creating violent discord against the smooth tropical blues and greens geddie was lounging in his hammock somewhat pale of face and languid in pose on that night when the valhalla s boat had brought him ashore apparently drenched to death by the sea doctor gregg and his other friends had toiled for hours to preserve the little spark of life that remained to him the bottle with its impotent message was gone out to sea and the problem that it had provoked was reduced to a simple sum in addition one and one make two by the rule of arithmetic one by the rule of romance there is a quaint old theory that man may have two souls a peripheral one which serves ordinarily and a central one which is stirred only at certain times but then with activity and vigor while under the domination of the former a man will shave vote pay taxes give money to his family buy subscription books and comport himself on the average plan but let the central soul suddenly become dominant and he may in the twinkling of an eye turn upon the partner of his joys with furious execration he may change his politics while you could snap your fingers he may deal out deadly insult to his dearest friend he may get him instanter to a monastery or a dance hall he may elope or hang himself or he may write a song or poem or kiss his wife unasked or give his funds to the search of a microbe then the peripheral soul will return and we have our safe sane citizen again it is but the revolt of the ego against order and its effect is to shake up the atoms only that they may settle where they belong geddie s revulsion had been a mild one no more than a swim in a summer sea after so inglorious an object as a drifting bottle and now he was himself again upon his desk ready for the post was a letter to his government tendering his resignation as consul to be effective as soon as another could be appointed in his place for bernard brannigan who never did things in a half way manner was to take geddie at once for a partner in his very profitable and various enterprises and paula was happily engaged in plans for refurnishing and decorating the upper story of the brannigan house the consul rose from his hammock when he saw the conspicuous stranger at this door keep your seat old man said the visitor with an airy wave of his large hand my name s smith and i ve come in a yacht you are the consul is that right a big cool guy on the beach directed me here thought i d pay my respects to the flag sit down said geddie i ve been admiring your craft ever since it came in sight looks like a fast sailer what s her tonnage search me said smith i don t know what she weighs in at but she s got a tidy gait the rambler that s her name don t take the dust of anything afloat this is my first trip on her i m taking a squint along this coast just to get an idea of the countries where the rubber and red pepper and revolutions come from i had no idea there was so much scenery down here why central park ain t in it with this neck of the woods i m from new york they get monkeys and coconuts and parrots down here is that right we have them all said geddie i m quite sure that our fauna and flora would take a prize over central park maybe they would admitted smith cheerfully i haven t seen them yet but i guess you ve got us skinned on the animal and vegetation question you don t have much travel here do you travel queried the consul i suppose you mean passengers on steamers no very few people land in coralio an investor now and then tourists and sightseers generally go further down the coast to one of the larger towns where there is a harbor i see a ship out there loading up with bananas said smith any passengers come on her that s the karlesfin said the consul she s a tramp fruiter made her last trip to new york i believe no she brought no passengers i saw her boat come ashore and there was no one about the only exciting recreation we have here is watching steamers when they arrive and a passenger on one of them generally causes the whole town to turn out if you are going to remain in coralio a while mr smith i ll be glad to take you around to meet some people there are four or five american chaps that are good to know besides the native high fliers thanks said the yachtsman but i wouldn t put you the trouble i d like to meet the guys you speak of but i won t be here long enough to do much knocking around that cool gent on the beach spoke of a doctor can you tell me where to find him the rambler ain t quite as steady on her feet as a broadway hotel and a fellow gets a touch of seasickness now and then thought i d strike the croaker for a handful of the little sugar pills in case i need em you will be apt to find doctor gregg at the hotel said the consul you can see it from the door it s that two story building with the balcony where the orange trees are the hotel de los extranjeros was a dreary hostelry in great disuse both by strangers and friends it stood at a corner of the street of the holy sepulchre a grove of small orange trees crowded against one side of it enclosed by a low rock wall over which a tall man might easily step the house was of plastered adobe stained a hundred shades of color by the salt breeze and the sun upon its upper balcony opened a central door and two windows containing broad jalousies instead of sashes the lower floor communicated by two doorways with the narrow rock paved sidewalk the pulperia or drinking shop of the proprietess madama timotea ortiz occupied the ground floor on the bottles of brandy anisada scotch smoke and inexpensive wines behind the little counter the dust lay thick save where the fingers of infrequent customers had left irregular prints the upper story contained four or five guest rooms which were rarely put to their destined use sometimes a fruitgrower riding in from his plantation to confer with his agent would pass a melancholy night in the dismal upper story sometimes a minor native official on some trifling government quest would have his pomp and majesty awed by madama s sepulchral hospitality but madama sat behind her bar content not desiring to quarrel with fate if any one required meat drink or lodging at the hotel de los extranjeros they had but to come and be served esta bueno if they came not why then they came not esta bueno as the exceptional yachtsman was making his way down the precarious sidewalk of the street of the holy sepulchre the solitary permanent guest of that decaying hotel sat at its door enjoying the breeze from the sea doctor gregg the quarantine physician was a man of fifty or sixty with a florid face and the longest beard between topeka and terra del fuego he held his position by virtue of an appointment by the board of health of a seaport city in one of the southern states that city feared the ancient enemy of every southern seaport the yellow fever and it was the duty of doctor gregg to examine crew and passengers of every vessel leaving coralio for preliminary symptoms the duties were light and the salary for one who lived in coralio ample surplus time there was in plenty and the good doctor added to his gains by a large private practice among the residents of the coast the fact that he did not know ten words of spanish was no obstacle a pulse could be felt and a fee collected without one being a linguist add to the description the facts that the doctor had a story to tell concerning the operation of trepanning which no listener had ever allowed him to conclude and that he believed in brandy as a prophylactic and the special points of interest possessed by doctor gregg will have become exhausted the doctor had dragged a chair to the sidewalk he was coatless and he leaned back against the wall and smoked while he stroked his beard surprise came into his pale blue eyes when he caught sight of smith in his unusual and prismatic clothes you re doctor gregg is that right said smith feeling the dog s head pin in his tie the constable i mean the consul told me you hung out at this caravansary my name s smith and i came in a yacht taking a cruise around looking at the monkeys and pineapple trees come inside and have a drink doc this cafe looks on the blink but i guess it can set out something wet i will join you sir in just a taste of brandy said doctor gregg rising quickly i find that as a prophylactic a little brandy is almost a necessity in this climate as they turned to enter the pulperia a native man barefoot glided noiselessly up and addressed the doctor in spanish he was yellowish brown like an over ripe lemon he wore a cotton shirt and ragged linen trousers girded by a leather belt his face was like an animal s live and wary but without promise of much intelligence this man jabbered with animation and so much seriousness that it seemed a pity that his words were to be wasted doctor gregg felt his pulse you sick he inquired mi mujer es enferma en la casa said the man thus endeavoring to convey the news in the only language open to him that his wife lay ill in her palm thatched hut the doctor drew a handful of capsules filled with a white powder from his trousers pocket he counted out ten of them into the native s hand and held up his forefinger impressively take one said the doctor every two hours he then held up two fingers shaking them emphatically before the native s face next he pulled out his watch and ran his finger round the dial twice again the two fingers confronted the patient s nose two two two hours repeated the doctor si senor said the native sadly he pulled a cheap silver watch from his own pocket and laid it in the doctor s hand me bring said he struggling painfully with his scant english other watchy tomorrow then he departed downheartedly with his capsules a very ignorant race of people sir said the doctor as he slipped the watch into his pocket he seems to have mistaken my directions for taking the physic for the fee however it is all right he owes me an account anyway the chances are that he won t bring the other watch you can t depend on anything they promise you about that drink now how did you come to coralio mr smith i was not aware that any boats except the karlesfin had arrived for some days the two leaned against the deserted bar and madama set out a bottle without waiting for the doctor s order there was no dust on it after they had drank twice smith said you say there were no passengers on the karlesfin doc are you sure about that it seems to me i heard somebody down on the beach say that there was one or two aboard they were mistaken sir i myself went out and put all hands through a medical examination as usual the karlesfin sails as soon as she gets her bananas loaded which will be about daylight in the morning and she got everything ready this afternoon no sir there was no passenger list like that three star a french schooner landed two slooploads of it a month ago if any customs duties on it went to the distinguished republic of anchuria you may have my hat if you won t have another come out and let s sit in the cool a while it isn t often we exiles get a chance to talk with somebody from the outside world the doctor brought out another chair to the sidewalk for his new acquaintance the two seated themselves you are a man of the world said doctor gregg a man of travel and experience your decision in a matter of ethics and no doubt on the points of equity ability and professional probity should be of value i would be glad if you will listen to the history of a case that i think stands unique in medical annals about nine years ago while i was engaged in the practice of medicine in my native city i was called to treat a case of contusion of the skull i made the diagnosis that a splinter of bone was pressing upon the brain and that the surgical operation known as trepanning was required however as the patient was a gentleman of wealth and position i called in for consultation doctor smith rose from his chair and laid a hand soft with apology upon the doctor s shirt sleeve say doc he said solemnly i want to hear that story you ve got me interrested and i don t want to miss the rest of it i know it s a loola by the way it begins and i want to tell it at the next meeting of the barney o flynn association if you don t mind but i ve got one or two matters to attend to first if i get em attended to in time i ll come right back and hear you spiel the rest before bedtime is that right by all means said the doctor get your business attended to and then return i shall wait up for you you see one of the most prominent physicians at the consultation diagnosed the trouble as a blood clot another said it was an abscess but i don t tell me now doc don t spoil the story wait till i come back i want to hear it as it runs off the reel is that right the mountains reached up their bulky shoulders to receive the level gallop of apollo s homing steeds the day died in the lagoons and in the shadowed banana groves and in the mangrove swamps where the great blue crabs were beginning to crawl to land for their nightly ramble and it died at last upon the highest peaks then the brief twilight ephemeral as the flight of a moth came and went the southern cross peeped with its topmost eye above a row of palms and the fire flies heralded with their torches and approach of soft footed night in the offing the karlesfin swayed at anchor her lights seeming to penetrate the water to countless fathoms with their shimmering lanceolate reflections the caribs were busy loading her by means of the great lighters heaped full from the piles of fruit ranged upon the shore on the sandy beach with his back against a coconut tree and the stubs of many cigars lying around him smith sat waiting never relaxing his sharp gaze in the direction of the steamer the incongruous yachtsman had concentrated his interest upon the innocent fruiter twice had he been assured that no passengers had come to coralio on board of her and yet with a persistence not to be attributed to an idling voyager he had appealed the case to the higher court of his own eyesight surprisingly like some gay coated lizard he crouched at the foot of the coconut palm and with the beady shifting eyes of the selfsame reptile sustained his espionage on the karlesfin on the white sands a whiter gig belonging to the yacht was drawn up guarded by one of the white ducked crew not far away in a pulperia on the shore following calle grande three other sailors swaggerred with their cues around coralio s solitary billiard table the boat lay there as if under orders to be ready for use at any moment there was in the atmosphere a hint of expectation of waiting for something to occur which was foreign to the air of coralio like some passing bird of brilliant plumage smith alights on this palmy shore but to preen his wings for an instant and then to fly away upon silent pinions when morning dawned there was no smith no waiting gig no yacht in the offing smith left no intimation of his mission there no footprints to show where he had followed the trail of his mystery on the sands of coralio that night he came he spake his strange jargon of the asphalt and the cafes he sat under the coconut tree and vanished the next morning coralio smithless ate its fried plantain and said the man of pictured clothing went himself away with the siesta the incident passed yawning into history so for a time must smith pass behind the scenes of the play he comes no more to coralio nor to doctor gregg who sits in vain wagging his redundant beard waiting to enrich his derelict audience with his moving tale of trepanning and jealousy but prosperously to the lucidity of these loose pages smith shall flutter among them again in the nick of time he shall come to tell us why he strewed so many anxious cigar stumps around the coconut palm that night this he must do for when he sailed away before the dawn in his yacht rambler he carried with him the answer to a riddle so big and preposterous that few in anchuria had ventured even to propound it iv caught the plans for the detention of the flying president miraflores and his companion at the coast line seemed hardly likely to fail doctor zavalla himself had gone to the port of alazan to establish a guard at that point at solitas the liberal patriot varras could be depended upon to keep close watch goodwin held himself responsible for the district about coralio the news of the president s flight had been disclosed to no one in the coast towns save trusted members of the ambitious political party that was desirous of succeeding to power the telegraph wire running from san mateo to the coast had been cut far up on the mountain trail by an emissary of zavalla s long before this could be repaired and word received along it from the capital the fugitives would have reached the coast and the question of escape or capture been solved goodwin had stationed armed sentinels at frequent intervals along the shore for a mile in each direction from coralio they were instructed to keep a vigilant lookout during the night to prevent miraflores from attempting to embark stealthily by means of some boat or sloop found by chance at the water s edge a dozen patrols walked the streets of coralio unsuspected ready to intercept the truant official should he show himself there goodwin was very well convinced that no precautions had been overlooked he strolled about the streets that bore such high sounding names and were but narrow grass covered lanes lending his own aid to the vigil that had been intrusted to him by bob englehart the town had begun the tepid round of its nightly diversions a few leisurely dandies cald in white duck with flowing neckties and swinging slim bamboo canes threaded the grassy by ways toward the houses of their favored senoritas those who wooed the art of music dragged tirelessly at whining concertinas or fingered lugubrious guitars at doors and windows an occasional soldier from the cuartel with flapping straw hat without coat or shoes hurried by balancing his long gun like a lance in one hand from every density of the foliage the giant tree frogs sounded their loud and irritating clatter further out the guttural cries of marauding baboons and the coughing of the alligators in the black estuaries fractured the vain silence of the wood by ten o clock the streets were deserted the oil lamps that had burned a sickly yellow at random corners had been extinguished by some economical civic agent coralio lay sleeping calmly between toppling mountains and encroaching sea like a stolen babe in the arms of its abductors somewhere over in that tropical darkness perhaps already threading the profundities of the alluvial lowlands the high adventurer and his mate were moving toward land s end the game of fox in the morning should be coming soon to its close goodwin at his deliberate gait passed the long low cuartel where coralio s contingent of anchuria s military force slumbered with its bare toes pointed heavenward there was a law that no civilian might come so near the headquarters of that citadel of war after nine o clock but goodwin was always forgetting the minor statutes quien vive shrieked the sentinel wrestling prodigiously with his lengthy musket americano growled goodwin without turning his head and passed on unhalted to the right he turned and to the left up the street that ultimately reached the plaza nacional when within the toss of a cigar stump from the intersecting street of the holy sepulchre he stopped suddenly in the pathway he saw the form of a tall man clothed in black and carrying a large valise hurry down the cross street in the direction of the beach and goodwin s second glance made him aware of a woman at the man s elbow on the farther side who seemed to urge forward if not even to assist her companion in their swift but silent progress they were no coralians those two goodwin followed at increased speed but without any of the artful tactics that are so dear to the heart of the sleuth the american was too broad to feel the instinct of the detective he stood as an agent for the people of anchuria and but for political reasons he would have demanded then and there the money it was the design of his party to secure the imperilled fund to restore it to the treasury of the country and to declare itself in power without bloodshed or resistance the couple halted at the door of the hotel de los extranjeros and the man struck upon the wood with the impatience of one unused to his entry being stayed madama was long in response but after a time her light showed the door was opened and the guests housed goodwin stoodin the quiet street lighting another cigar in two minutes a faint gleam began to show between the slats of the jalousies in the upper story of the hotel they have engaged rooms said goodwin to himself so then their arrangements for sailing have yet to be made at the moment there came along one esteban delgado a barber an enemy to existing government a jovial plotter against stagnation in any form this barber was one of coralio s saddest dogs often remaining out of doors as late as eleven post meridian he was a partisan liberal and he greeted goodwin with flatulent importance as a brother in the cause but he had something important to tell what think you don frank he cried in the universal tone of the conspirator i have tonight shaved la barba what you call the weeskers of the presidente himself of this countree consider he sent for me to come in the poor casita of an old woman he awaited me in a verree leetle house in a dark place carramba el senor presidente to make himself thus secret and obscured i shave a man and not see his face this gold piece he gave me and said it was to be all quite still i think don frank there is what you call a chip over the bug have you ever seen president miraflores before asked goodwin but once answered esteban he is tall and he had weeskers verree black and sufficient was any one else present when you shaved him an old indian woman senor that belonged with the casa and one senorita a ladee of so much beautee ah dios all right esteban said goodwin it s very lucky that you happened along with your tonsorial information the new administration will be likely to remember you for this then in a few words he made the barber acquainted with the crisis into which the affairs of the nation had culminated and instructed him to remain outside keeping watch upon the two sides of the hotel that looked upon the street and observing whether any one should attempt to leave the house by any door or window goodwin himself went to the door through which the guests had entered opened it and stepped inside madama had returned downstairs from her journey above to see after the comfort of her lodgers her candle stood upon the bar she was about to take a thimbleful of rum as a solace for having her rest disturbed she looked up without surprise or alarm as her third caller entered ah it is the senor goodwin not often does he honor my poor house with his presence i must come oftener said goodwin with a goodwin smile i hear that your cognac is the best between belize to the north and rio to the south set out the bottle madama and let us have the proof in un vasito for each of us my aguardiente said madama with pride is the best it grows in beautiful bottles in the dark places among the banana trees si senor only at midnight can they be picked by sailor men who bring them before daylight comes to your back door good aguardiente is a verree difficult fruit to handle senor goodwin smuggling in coralio was much nearer than competition to being the life of trade one spoke of it slyly yet with a certain conceit when it had been well accomplished you have guests in the house tonight said goodwin laying a silver dollar upon the counter why not said madama counting the change two but the smallest while finished to arrive one senor not quite old and one senorita of sufficient hadsomeness to their rooms they have ascended not desiring the to eat nor the to drink two rooms numero and numero i was expecting that gentleman and that lady said goodwin i have important negocios that must be transacted will you allow me to see them why not sighed madama placidly why should not senor goodwin ascend and speak to his friends esta bueno romm numero and romm numero goodwin loosened in his coat pocket the american revolver that he carried and ascended the steep dark stairway in the hallway above the saffron light from a hanging lamp allowed him to select the gaudy numbers on the doors he turned the knob on number entered and closed the door behind him if that was isabel guilbert seated by the table in that poorly furnished room report had failed to do her charms justice she rested her head upon one hand extreme fatigue was signified in every line of her figure and upon her countenance a deep perplexity was written her eyes were gray irised and of that mold that seems to have belonged to the orbs of all the famous queens of hearts their whites were singularly clear and brilliant concealed above the irises by heavy horizontal lids and showing a snowy line between them such eyes denote great nobility vigor and if you can conceive of it a most generous selfishness she looked up when the american entered with an expression of surprised inquiry but without alarm goodwin took off his hat and seated himself with his characteristic deliberate ease upon a corner of the table he held a lighted cigar between his fingers he took this familiar course because he was sure that preliminaries would be wasted upon miss guilbert he knew her history and the small part that the conventions had played in it good evening he said now madame let us come to business at once you will observe that i mention no names but i know who is in the next room and what he carries in that valise that is the point which brings me here i have come to dictate terms of surrender the lady neither moved nor replied but steadily regarded the cigar in goodwin s hand we continued the dictator thoughtfully regarding the neat buckskin shoe on his gently swinging foot i speak for a considerable majority of the people demand the return of the stolen funds belonging to them our terms go very little further than that they are very simple as an accredited spokesman i promise that our interference will cease if they are accepted give up the money and you and your companion will be permitted to proceed wherever you will in fact assistance will be given you in the matter of securing a passage by any outgoing vessel you may choose it is on my personal responsibility that i add congratulations to the gentleman in number upon his taste in feminine charms returning his cigar to his mouth goodwin observed her and saw that her eyes followed it and rested upon it with icy and significant concentration apparently she had not heard a word he had said he understood tossed the cigar out the window and with an amused laugh slid from the table to his feet that is better said the lady it makes it possible for me to listen to you for a second lesson in good manners you might now tell me by whom i am being insulted i am sorry said goodwin leaning one hand on the table that my time is too brief for devoting much of it to a course of etiquette come now i appeal to you good sense you have shown yourself in more than one instance to be well aware of what is to your advantage this is an occasion that demands the exercise of your undoubted intelligence there is no mystery here i am frank goodwin and i have come for the money i entered this room at a venture had i entered the other i would have had it before me now do you want it in words the gentleman in number has betrayed a great trust he has robbed his people of a large sum and it is i who will prevent their losing it i do not say who that gentleman is but if i should be forced to see him and he should prove to be a certain high official of the republic it will be my duty to arrest him the house is guarded i am offering you liberal terms it is not absolutely necessary that i confer personally with the gentleman in the next room bring me the valise containing the money and we will call the affair ended the lady arose from her chair and stood for a moment thinking deeply do you live here mr goodwin she asked presently yes what is your authority for this intrusion i am an instrument of the republic i was advised by wire of the movements of the gentleman in number may i ask you two or three questions i believe you to be a man more apt to be truthful than timid what sort of town is this coralio i think they call it not much of a town said goodwin smiling a banana town as they run grass huts dobes five or six two story houses accomodations limited population half breed spanish and indian caribs and blackamoors no sidewalks to speak of no amusements rather unmoral that a an offhand sketch of course are there any inducements say in a social or in a business way for people to reside here oh yes answered goodwin smiling broadly there are no afternoon teas no hand organs no department stores and there is no extradition treaty he told me went on the lady speaking as if to herself and with a slight frown that there were towns on this coast of beauty and importance that there was a pleasing social order especially an american colony of cultured residents there is an american colony said goodwin gazing at her in some wonder some of the members are all right some are fugitives from justice from the states i recall two exiled bank presidents one army paymaster under a cloud a couple of manslayers and a widow arsenic i believe was the suspicion in her case i myself complete the colony but as yet i have not distinguished myself by any particular crime do not lose hope said the lady dryly i see nothing in your actions tonight to guarantee you further obscurity some mistake has been made i do not know just where but him you shall not disturb tonight the journey has fatigued him so that he has fallen asleep i think in his clothes you talk of stolen money i do not understand you some mistake has been made i will convince you remain where you are and i will bring you the valise that you seem to covet so and show it to you she moved toward the closed door that connected the two rooms but stopped and half turned and bestowed upon goodwin a grave searching look that ended in a quizzical smile you force my door she said and you follow your ruffianly behavior with the basest accusations and yet she hesitated as if to reconsider what she was about to say and yet it is a puzzling thing i am sure there has been some mistake she took a step toward the door but goodwin stayed her by a light touch upon her arm i have said before that women turned to look at him in the streets he was the viking sort of man big good looking and with an air of kindly truculence she was dark and proud glowing or pale as her mood moved her i do not know if eve were light or dark but if such a woman had stood in the garden i know that the apple would have been eaten this woman was to be goodwin s fate and he did not know it but he must have felt the first throes of destiny for as he faced her the knowledge of what report named her turned bitter in her throat if there has been any mistake he said hotly it was yours i do not blame the man who has lost his country his honor and is about to lose the poor consolation of his stolen riches as much as i blame you for by heaven i can very well see how he was brought to it i can understand and pity him it is such women as you that strew this degraded coast with wretched exiles that make men forget their trusts that drag the lady interrupted him with a weary gesture there is no need to continue your insults she said coldly i do not understand what you are saying nor do i know what mad blunder you are making but if the inspection of the contents of a gentleman s portmanteau will rid me of you let us delay it no longer she passed quickly and noiselessly into the other room and returned with the heavy leather valise which she handed to the american with an air of patient contempt goodwin set the valise quickly upon the table and began to unfasten the straps the lady stood by with an expression of infinite scorn and weariness upon her face the valise opened wide to a powerful sidelong wrench goodwin dragged out two or three articles of clothing exposing the bulk of its contents package after package of tightly packed united states bank and treasury notes of large denomination reckoning from the high figures written upon the paper bands that bound them the total must have come closely upon the hundred thousand mark goodwin glanced swiftly at the woman and saw with surprise and a thrill of pleasure that he wondered at that she had experienced an unmistakeable shock her eyes grew wide she gasped and leaned heavily against the table she had been ignorant then he inferred that her companion had looted the government treasury but why he angrily asked himself should he be so well pleased to think this wandering and unscrupulous singer not so black as report had painted her a noise in the other room startled them both the door swung open and a tall elderly dark complexioned man recently shaven hurried into the room all the pictures of president miraflores represent him as the possessor of a luxuriant supply of dark and carefully tended whiskers but the story of the barber esteban had prepared goodwin for the change the man stumbled in from the dark room his eyes blinking at the lamplight and heavy from sleep what does this mean he demanded in excellent english with a keen and perturbed look at the american robbery very near it answered goodwin but i rather think i m in time to prevent it i represent the people to whom this money belongs and i have come to convey it back to them he thrust his hand into a pocket of his loose linen coat the other man s hand went quickly behind him don t draw called goodwin sharply i ve got you covered from my pocket the lady stepped forward and laid one hand upon the shoulder of her hesitating companion she pointed to the table tell me the truth the truth she said in a low voice whose money is that the man did not answer he gave a deep long drawn sigh leaned and kissed her on the forehead stepped back into the other room and closed the door goodwin foresaw his purpose and jumped for the door but the report of the pistol echoed as his hand touched the knob a heavy fall followed and some one swept him aside and struggled into the room of the fallen man a desolation thought goodwin greater than that derived from the loss of cavalier and gold must have been in the heart of the enchantress to have wrung from her in that moment the cry of one turning to the all forgiving all comforting earthly consoler to have made her call out from that bloody and dishonored room oh mother mother mother but there was an alarm outside the barber esteban at the sound of the shot had raised his voice and the shot itself had aroused half the town a pattering of feet came up the street and official orders rang out on the still air goodwin had a duty to perform circumstances had made him the custodian of his adopted country s treasure swiftly cramming the money into the valise he closed it leaned far out of the window and dropped it into a thick orange tree in the little inclosure below they will tell you in coralio as they delight in telling the stranger of the conclusion of that tragic flight they will tell you how the upholders of the law came apace when the alarm was sounded the comandante in red slippers and a jacket like a head waiter s and girded sword the soldiers with their interminable guns followed by outnumbering officers struggling into their gold and lace epaulettes the bare footed policemen the only capables in the lot and ruffled citizens of every hue and description they say that the countenance of the dead man was marred sadly by the effects of the shot but he was identified as the fallen president by both goodwin and the barber esteban on the next morning messages began to come over the mended telegraph wire and the story of the flight from the capital was given out to the public in san mateo the revolutionary party had seized the sceptre of government without opposition and the vivas of the mercurial populace quickly effaced the interest belonging to the unfortunate miraflores they will relate to you how the new government sifted the towns and raked the roads to find the valise containing anchuria s surplus capital which the president was known to have carried with him but all in vain in coralio senor goodwin himself led the searching party which combed that town as carefully as a woman combs her hair but the money was not found so they buried the dead man without honors back of the town near the little bridge that spans the mangrove swamp and for a real a boy will show you his grave they say that the old woman in whose hut the barber shaved the president placed the wooden slab at his head and burned the inscription upon it with a hot iron you will hear also that senor goodwin like a tower of strength shielded dona isabel guilbert through those subsequent distressful days and that his scruples as to her past career if he had any vanished and her adventuresome waywardness if she had any left her and they were wedded and were happy the american built a home on a little foothill near the town it is a conglomerate structure of native woods that exported would be worth a fortune and of brick palm glass bamboo and adobe there is a paradise of nature about it and something of the same sort within the natives speak of its interior with hands uplifted in admiration there are floors polished like mirrors and covered with hand woven indian rugs of silk fibre tall ornaments and pictures musical instruments and papered walls figure it to yourself they exclaim but they cannot tell you in coralio as you shall learn what became of the money that frank goodwin dropped into the orange tree but that shall come later for the palms are fluttering in the breeze bidding us to sport and gaiety v cupid s exile number two the united states of america after looking over its stock of consular timber selected mr john de graffenreid atwood of dalesburg alabama for a successor to willard geddie resigned without prejudice to mr atwood it will have to be acknowledged that in this instance it was the man who sought the office as with the self banished geddie it was nothing less than the artful smiles of lovely woman that had driven johnny atwood to the desperate expedient of accepting office under a despised federal government so that he might go far far away and never see again the false fair face that had wrecked his young life the consulship at coralio seemed to offer a retreat sufficiently removed and romantic enough to inject the necessary drama into the pastoral scenes of dalesburg life it was while playing the part of cupid s exile that johnny added his handiwork to the long list of casualties along the spanish main by his famous manipulation of the shoe market and his unparalleled feat of elevating the most despised and useless weed in his own country from obscurity to be a valuable product in international commerce the trouble began as trouble often begins instead of ending with a romance in dalesburg there was a man named elijah hemstetter who kept a general store his family consisted of one daughter called rosine a name that atoned much for hemstetter this young woman was possessed of plentiful attractions so that the young men of the community were agitated in their bosoms among the more agitated was johnny the son of judge atwood who lived in the big colonial mansion on the edge of dalesburg it would seem that the desirable rosine should have been pleased to return the affection of an atwood a name honored all over the state long before and since the war it does seem that she should have gladly consented to have been led into that stately but rather empty colonial mansion but not so there was a cloud on the horizon a threatening cumulus cloud in the shape of a lively and shrewd young farmer in the neighborhood who dared to enter the lists as a rival to the high born atwood one night johnny propounded to rosine a question that is considered of much importance by the young of the human species the accessories were all there moonlight oleanders magnolias the mockingbird s song whether or no the shadow of pinkney dawson that prosperous young farmer came between them on that occasion is not known but rosine s answer was unfavorable mr john de graffenreid atwood bowed till his hat touched the lawn grass and went away with his head high but with a sore wound in his pedigree and heart a hemstetter refuse an atwood zounds among other accidents of that year was a democratic president judge atwood was a warhorse of democracy johnny persuaded him to set the wheels moving for some foreign appointment he would go away away perhaps in years to come rosine would think how true how faithful his love had been and would drop a tear maybe in the cream she would be skimming for pink dawson s breakfast the wheels of politics revolved and johnny was appointed consul to coralio just before leaving he dropped in at hemstetter s to say good bye there was a queer pinkish look about rosine s eyes and had the two been alone the united states might have had to cast about for another consul but pink dawson was there of course talking about his acre orchard and the three mile alfalfa tract and the acre pasture so johnny shook hands with rosine as coolly as if he were only going to run up to montgomery for a couple of days they had the royal manner when they chose those atwoods if you happen to strike anything in the way of a good investment down there johnny said pink dawson just let me know will you i reckon i could lay my hands on a few extra thousands most any time for a profitable deal certainly pink said johnny pleasantly if i strike anything of that sort i ll let you in with pleasure so johnny went down to mobile and took a fruit steamer for the coast of anchuria when the new consul arrived in coralio the strangeness of the scenes diverted him much he was only twenty two and the grief of youth was not worn like a garment as it is by older men it has its seasons when it reigns and then it is unseated for time by the assertion of the keen senses billy keogh and johnny seemed to conceive a mutual friendship at once keogh took the new consul about town and presented him to the handful of americans and the smaller number of french and germans who made up the foreign contingent and then of course he had to be more formally introduced to the native officials and have his credentials transmitted through an interpreter there was something about the young southerner that the sophisticated keogh liked his manner was simple almost to boyishness but he possessed the cool carelessness of a man of far greater age and experience neither uniforms nor titles red tape nor foreign languages mountains nor sea weighed upon his spirits he was heir to all ages an atwood of dalesburg and you might know every thought conceived to his bosom geddie came down to the consulate to explain the duties and workings of the office he and keogh tried to interest the new consul in their description of the work that his government expected him to perform it s all right said johnnie from the hammock that he had set up as the official reclining place if anything turns up that has to be done i ll let you fellows do it you can t expect a democrat to work during his first term of holding office you might look over these headings suggested geddie of the different lines of exports you will have to keep account of the fruit is classified and there are the valuable woods coffee rubber that last account sounds all right interrupted mr atwood sounds as if it could be stretched i want to buy a new flag a monkey a guitar and a barrel of pineapples will the rubber account stretch over em that s merely statistics said geddie smiling the expense account is what you want it is supposed to have a slight elasticity the stationery items are sometimes carelessly audited by the state department we re wasting our time said keogh this man was born to hold office he penetrates to the root of the art at one step of his eagle eye the true genius of government shows its hand in every word of his speech i didn t take this job with any intention of working explained johnny lazily i wanted to go somewhere in the world where they didn t talk about farms there are none here are there not the kind you are acquainted with answered the ex consul there is no such art here as agriculture there never was a plow or a reaper within the boundaries of anchuria this is the country for me murmured the consul and immediately he fell asleep the cheerful tintypist pursued his intimacy with johnny in spite of open charges that he did so to obtain a preemption on a seat in that coveted spot the rear gallery of the consulate but whether his designs were selfish or purely friendly keogh achieved that desirable privilege few were the nights on which the two could not be found reposing there in the sea breeze with their heels on the railing and the cigars and brandy conveniently near one evening they sat thus mainly silent for their talk had dwindled before the stilling influence of an unusual night there was a great full moon and the sea mother of pearl almost every sound was hushed for the air was but faintly stirring and the town lay panting waiting for the night to cool offshore lay the fruit steamer andador of the vesuvius line full laden and scheduled to sail at six in the morning there were no loiterers on the beach so bright was the moonlight that the two men could see the small pebbles shining on the beach where the gentle surf wetted them then down the coast tacking close to shore slowly swam a little sloop white winged like some snowy sea fowl its course lay within twenty points of the wind s eye so it veered in and out again in long slow strokes like the movements of a graceful skater again the tactics of its crew brought it close in shore this time nearly opposite the consulate and then there blew from the sloop clear and surprising notes as if from a horn of elfland a fairy bugle it might have been sweet and silvery and unexpected playing with spirit the familiar air of home sweet home it was a scene set for the land of the lotus the authority of the sea and the tropics the mystery that attends unknown sails and the prestige of drifting music on moonlit waters gave it an anodynous charm johnny atwood felt it and thought of dalesburg but as soon as keogh s mind had arrived at a theory concerning the peripatetic solo he sprang to the railing and his ear rending yawp fractured the silence of coralio like a cannon shot mel lin ger a hoy the sloop was now on its outward tack but from it came a clear answering hail good bye billy go ing home bye the andador was the sloop s destination no doubt some passenger with a sailing permit from some up the coast point had come down in this sloop to catch the regular fruit steamer on its return trip like a coquettish pigeon the little boat tacked on its eccentric way until at last its white sail was lost to sight against the larger bulk of the fruiter s side that s old h p mellinger explained keogh dropping back into his chair he s going back to new york he was a private secretary of the late hot foot president of this grocery and fruit stand that they call a country his job s over now and i guess old mellinger is glad why does he disappear to music like zo zo the magic queen asked johnny just to show em that he doesn t care that noise you heard is a phonograph said keogh i sold him that mellinger had a graft in this country that was the only thing of its kind in the world the tooting machine saved it for him once and he always carried it around with him afterward tell me about it demanded johnny betraying interest i m no disseminator of narratives said keogh i can use language for purposes of speech but when i attempt a discourse the words come out as they will and they may make sense when they strike the atmosphere or they may not i want to hear about the graft persisted johnny you ve got no right to refuse i ve told you all about every man woman and hitching post in dalesburg you shall hear it said keogh i said my instincts of narrative were perplexed don t you believe it it s an art i ve acquired along with many other of the graces and sciences vi the phonograph and the graft what was this this graft asked johnny with the impatience of the great public to whom tales are told tis contrary to art and philosophy to give you the information said keogh calmly the art of narrative consists in concealing from your audience everything it wants to know until after you expose your favorite opinions on topics foreign to the subject a good story is like a bitter pill with the sugar coating inside of it i will begin if you please with a horoscope located in the cherokee nation and end with a moral tune on the phonograph me and henry horsecollar brought the first phonograph to this country henry was a quarter breed quarter back cherokee educated east in the idioms of football and west in contraband whiskey and a gentleman the same as you and me he was easy and romping in his ways a man about six foot with a kind of rubber tire movement yes he was a little man about five foot five or five foot eleven he was what you would call a medium tall man of average smallness henry had quit college once and the muscogee jail three times the last named institution on account of introducing and selling whisky in the territories henry horsecollar never let any cigar stores come up and stand behind him he didn t belong to that tribe of indians henry and me met at texarkana and figured out this phonograph scheme he had which came to him out of a land allotment in the reservation i had run down from little rock on account of a distressful scene i had witnessed on the street there a man stood on a box and passed around some gold watches screw case stem winders elgin movement very elegant twenty bucks they cost you over the counter at three dollars the crowd fought for the tickers the man happened to find a valise full of them handy and he passed them out like putting hot biscuits on a plate the backs were hard to unscrew but the crowd put its ear to the case and they ticked mollifying and agreeable three of these watches were genuine tickers the rest were only kickers hey why empty cases with one of them horny black bugs that fly around electric lights in em them bugs kick off minutes and seconds industrious and beautiful so this man i was speaking of cleaned up and then he went away because he knew that when it came time to wind watches in little rock an entomologist would be needed and he wasn t one so as i say henry had and i had the idea of introducing the phonograph to south america was henry s but i took to it freely being fond of machinery of all kinds the latin races says henry explaining easy in the idioms he learned at college are peculiarly adapted to be victims of the phonograph they yearn for music and color and gaiety they give wampum to the hand organ man and the four legged chicken in the tent when they re three months behind with the grocery and the bread fruit tree then says i we ll export canned music to the latins but i m mindful of mr julius caesar s account of em where he says omnia gallia in tres partes divisa est which is the same as to say we will need all of our gall in devising means to tree them parties i hated to make a show of education but i was disinclined to be overdone in syntax by a mere indian a member of a race to which we owe nothing except the land on which the united states is situated we bought a fine phonograph in texarkana one of the best make and half a trunkful of records we packed up and took the t and p for new orleans from that celebrated center of molasses and disfranchised coon songs we took a steamer for south america we landed at solitas forty miles up the coast from here twas a palatable enough place to look at the houses were clean and white and to look at em stuck around among the scenery they reminded you of hard boiled eggs served with lettuce there was a block of skyscraper mountains in the suburbs and they kept pretty quiet like they had crept up there and were watching the town and the sea was remarking sh sh sh on the beach and now and then a ripe coconut would drop kerblip in the sand and that was all there was doing yes i judge that town was considerably on the quiet i judge that after gabriel quits blowing his horn and the car starts with philadelphia swinging to the last strap and pine gully arkansas hanging onto the rear step this town of solitas will wake up and ask if anybody spoke the captain went ashore with us and offered to conduct what he seemed to like to call the obsequies he introduced henry and me to the united states consul and a roan man the head of the department of mercenary and licentious dispostions the way it read upon his sign i thouch here again a week from today says the captain by that time we told him we ll be amassing wealth in the interior towns with our galvanized prima donna and correct imitations of sousa s band excavating a march from a tin mine ye ll not says the captain ye ll be hypnotized any gentleman in the audience who kindly steps upon the stage and looks this country in the eye will be converted to the hypothesis that he s but a fly in the elgin creamery ye ll be standing knee deep in the surf waiting for me and your machine for making hamburger steak out of the hitherto respected art of music will be playing there s no place like home henry skinned a twenty off his roll and received from the bureau of mercenary dispositions a paper bearing a red seal and a dialect story and no change then we got the consul full of red wine and struck him for a horoscope he was a thin youngish kind of man i should say past fifty sort of french irish in his affections and puffed up with disconsolation yes he was a flattened kind of man in whom drink lay stagnant inclined to corpulence and misery yes i think he was a kind of dutchman being very sad and genial in his ways the marvelous invention he says entitled the phonograph has never invaded these shores the people have never heard it they would not believe it if they should simple hearted children of nature progress has never condemned them to accept the work of a can opener as an overture and rag time might incite them to a bloody revolution but you can try the experiment the best chance you have is that the populace may not wake up when you play there s two ways says the consul they may take it they may become inebriated with attention like an atlanta colonel listening to marching through georgia or they will get excited and transpose the key of the music with an axe and yourselves into a dungeon in the latter case says the consul i ll do my duty by cabling to the state department and i ll wrap the stars and stripes around you when you come to be shot and threaten them with the vengeance of the greatest gold export and financial reserve nation on earth the flag is full of bullet holes now says the consul made in that way twice before says the consul i have cabled our government for a couple of gunboats to protect american citizens the first time the department sent me a pair of gum boots the other time was when a man named pease was going to be executed here they referred that appeal to the secretary of agriculture let us now disturb the senor behind the bar for a subsequence of the red wine thus soliloquized the consul of solitas to me and henry horsecollar but notwithstanding we hired a room that afternoon in the calle de los angeles the main street that runs along the shore and put our trunks there twas a good sized room dark and cheerful but small twas on a various street diversified by houses and conservatory plants the peasantry of the city passed to and fro on the fine pasturage between the sidewalks twas for the world like an opera chorus when the royal kafoozlum is about to enter we were rubbing the dust off the machine and getting fixed to start business the next day when a big fine looking white man in white clothes stopped at the door and looked in we extended the invitations and he walked inside and sized us up he was chewing a long cigar and wrinkling his eyes meditative like a girl trying to decide which dress to wear to the party new york he says to me finally originally and from time to time i says hasn t it rubbed off yet it s simple says he when you know how it s the fit of the vest they don t cut vests right anywhere else coats maybe but not vests the white man looks at henry horsecollar and hesitates injun says henry tame injun mellinger says the man homer p mellinger boys you re confiscated you re babes in the wood without a chaperon or referee and it s my duty to start you going i ll knock out the props and launch you proper in the pellucid waters of this tropical mud puddle you ll have to be christened and if you ll come with me i ll break a bottle of wine across your bows according to hoyle well for two days homer p mellinger did the honors that man cut ice in anchuria he was it he was the royal kafoozlum if me and henry was babes in the wood he was a robin redbreast from the topmost bough him and me and henry horsecollar locked arms and toted that phonograph around and had wassail and diversions everywhere we found doors open we went inside and set the machine going and mellinger called upon the people to observe the artful music and his two lifelong friends the senores americanos the opera chorus was agitated with esteem and followed us from house to house there was a different kind of drink to be had with every tune the natives had acquirements of a pleasant thing in the way of a drink that gums itself to the recollection they chop off the end of a green coconut and pour in on the juice of it french brandy and other adjuvants we had them and other things mine and henry s money was counterfeit everything was on homer p mellinger that man could find rolls of bills concealed in places on his person where hermann the wizard couldn t have conjured out a rabbit or an omelette he could have founded universities and made orchid collections and then had enough left to purchase the colored vote of his country henry and me wondered what his graft was one evening he told us boys said he i ve deceived you you think i m a painted butterfly but in fact i m the hardest worked man in this country ten years ago i landed on its shores and two years ago on the point of its jaw yes i guess i can get the decision over this ginger cake commonwealth at the end of any round i choose i ll confide in you because you are my countrymen and guests even if you have assaulted my adopted shores with the worst system of noises ever set to music my job is private secretary to the president of this republic and my duties are running it i m not headlined in the bills but i m the mustard in the salad dressing just the same there isn t a law goes before congress there isn t a concession granted there isn t an import duty levied but what h p mellinger he cooks and seasons it in the front office i fill the president s inkstand and search visiting statesmen for dirks and dynamite but in the back room i dictate the policy of the government you d never guess in the world how i got my pull it s the only graft of its kind on earth i ll put you wise you remember the old top liner in the copy book honesty is the best policy that s it i m working honestly for a graft i m the only honest man in the republic the government knows it the people know it the boodlers know it the foreign investors know it i make the government keep its faith if a man is promised a job he gets it if outside capital buys a concession it gets the goods i run the monopoly of square dealing here there s no competition if colonel diogenes were to flash his lantern in this precinct he d have my address inside of two minutes there isn t big money in it but it s a sure thing and lets a man sleep of nights thus homer p mellinger made oration to me and henry horsecollar and later he divested himself of this remark boys i m to hold a soiree this evening with a gang of leading citizens and i want your assistance you bring the musical corn sheller and give the affair the outside appearance of a function there s important business on hand but it mustn t show i can talk to you people i ve been pained for years on account of not having anybody to blow off and brag to i get homesick sometimes and i d swap the entire perquisites of office for just one hour to have a stein and a caviar sandwich somewhere on thirty fourth street and stand and watch the street cars go by and smell the peanut roaster at old giuseppe s fruit stand yes said i there s fine caviar at billy renfrew s cafe corner of thirty fourth and god knows it interrupts mellinger and if you d told me you knew billy renfrew i d have invented tons of ways of making you happy billy was my side kicker in new york there is a man who never knew what crooked was here i am working honesty for a graft but that man loses money on it carrambos i get sick at times of this country everything s rotten from the executive down to the coffee pickers they re plotting to down each other and skin their friends if a mule driver takes off his hat to an official that man figures it out that he s a popular idol and set his pegs to stir up a revolution and upset the administration it s one of my little chores as private secretary to smell out these revolutions and affix the kibosh before they break out and scratch the paint off the government property that s why i m down here now in this mildewed coast town the governor of the district and his crew are plotting to uprise i ve got every one of their names and they re invited to listen to the phonograph tonight compliments of h p m that s the way i ll get them in a bunch and things are on the program to happen to them we three were sitting at table in the cantina of the purified saints mellinger poured out wine and was looking some worried i was thinking they re a sharp crowd he says kind of fretful they re capitalized by a foreign syndicate after rubber and they re loaded to the muzzle for bribing i m sick goes on mellinger of comic opera i want to smell east river and wear suspenders again at times i feel loke throwing up my job but i m d n fool enough to be sort of proud of it there s mellinger they say here por dios you can t touch him with a million i d like to take that record back and show it to billy renfrow some day and that tightens my grip whenever i see a fat thing that i could corral just by winking one eye and losing my graft by they can t monkey with me they know it what money i get i make honest and spend it some day i ll make a pile and go back and eat caviar with billy tonight i ll show you how to handle a bunch of corruptionists i ll show them what mellinger private secretary means when you spell it with the cotton and tissue paper off mellinger appears shaky and breaks his glass against the neck of the bottle i says to myself white man if i m not mistaken there s been a bait laid out where the tail of your eye could see it that night according to arrangements me and henry took the phonograph to a room in a dobe house in a dirty side street where the grass was knee high twas a long room lit with smoky oil lamps there was plenty of chairs and a table at the back end we set the phonograph on the table mellinger was there walking up and down disturbed in his predicaments he chewed cigars and spat em out and he bit the thumb nail of his left hand by and by the invitations to the musicale come sliding in by pairs and threes and spade flushes their color was of a diversity running from a three day s smoked meerschaum to a patent leather polish they were as polite as wax being devastated with enjoyments to give senor mellinger the good evenings i understood their spanish talk i ran a pumping engine two years in a mexican silver mine and had it pat but i never let on maybe fifty of em had come and was seated when in slid the king bee the governor of the district mellinger met him at the door and escorted him to the grand stand when i saw that latin man i knew that mellinger private secretary had all the dances on his card taken that was a big squashy man the color of a rubber overshoe and he had an eye like a head waiter s mellinger explained fluent in the castilian idioms that his soul was disconcerted with joy at introducing to his respected friends america s greatest invention the wonder of the age henry got the cue and run on an elegant brass band record and the festivities became initiated the governor man had a bit of english under his hat and when the music was choked off he says ver r ree fine gr r r r racias the american gentlemen the so esplendeed moosic as to playee the table was a long one and henry and me sat at the end of it next the wall the governor sat at the other end homer p mellinger stood at the side of it i was just wondering how mellinger was going to handle his crowd when the home talent suddenly opened the services that governor man was suitable for uprisings and policies i judge he was a ready kind of man who took his own time yes he was full of attention and immediateness he leaned his hands on the table and imposed his face toward the secretary man do the american senors understand spanish he asks in his native accents they do not says mellinger then listen goes on the latin man prompt the musics are of sufficient prettiness but not of necessity let us speak of business i well know why we are here since i observe my compatriots you had a whisper yesterday senor mellinger of our proposals tonight we will speak out we know that you stand in the president s favor and we know your influence the government will be changed we know the worth of your services we esteem your friendship and aid so much that mellinger praises his hand but the governor man bottles him up do not speak until i have done the governor man then draws a package wrapped in paper from his pocket and lays it on the table by mellinger s hand in that you will find fifty thousand dollars in money of your country you can do nothing against us but you can be worth that for us go back to the capital and obey our instructions take that money now we trust you you will find with it a paper giving in detail the work you will be expected to do for us do not have the unwiseness to refuse the governor man paused with his eyes fixed on mellinger full of expressions and observances i looked at mellinger and was glad billy renfrew couldn t see him then the sweat was popping out on his forehead and he stood dumb tapping the little package with the ends of his fingers the colorado maduro gang was after his graft he had only to change his politics and stuff five fingers in his inside pocket henry whispers to me and wants the pause in the program interpreted i whisper back h p is up against a bribe senator s size and the coons have got him going i saw mellinger s hand moving closer to the package he s weakening i whispered to henry we ll remind him says henry of the peanut roaster on thirty fourth street new york henry stooped down and got a record from the basketful we d brought slid it in the phonograph and started her off it was a cornet solo very neat and beautiful and the name of it was home sweet home not one of them fifty odd men in the room moved while it was playing and the governor man kept his eyes steady on mellinger i saw mellinger s head go up little by little and his hand came creeping away from the package not until the last note sounded did anybody stir and there homer p mellinger takes up the bundle of boodle and slams it in the governor man s face that s my answer says mellinger private secretary and there ll be another in the morning i have proofs of conspiracy against every man of you the show is over gentlemen there s one more act puts in the governor man you are a servant i believe employed by the president to copy letters and answer raps at the door i am governor here senores i call upon you in the name of the cause to seize this man that brindled gang of conspirators shoved back their chairs and advanced in force i could see where mellinger had made a mistake in massing his enemy so as to make a grand stand play i think he made another one too but we can pass that mellinger s idea of a graft and mine being different according to estimations and points of view there was only one window and door in that room and they were in the front end here was fifty odd latin men coming in a bunch to obstruct the legislation of mellinger you may say there were three of us for me and henry simultaneous declared new york city and the cherokee nation in sympathy with the weaker party then it was that henry horsecollar rose to a point of disorder and intervened showing admirable the advantages of education as applied to the american indian s natural intellect and native refinement he stood up and smoothed back his hair on each side with his hands as you have seen little girls do when they play get behind me both of you says henry what s it to be chief i asked i m going to buck center says henry in his football idioms there isn t a tackle in the lot of them follow me close and rush the game then that cultured red man exhaled an arrangement of sounds with his mouth that made the latin aggregation pause with thoughtfulness and hesitations the matter of his proclamation seemed to be a cooperation of the carlisle war whoop with the cherokee college yell he went at the chocolate team like a bean out of a little boy s nigger shooter his right elbow laid out the governor man on the gridiron and he made a lane the length of the crowd so wide that a woman could have carried a stepladder through it without striking against anything all mellinger and me had to do was to follow it took us just three minutes to get out of that street around to military headquarters where mellinger had things his own way a colonel and a battalion of bare toed infantry turned out and went back to the scene of the musicale with us but the conspirator gang was gone but we recaptured the phonograph with honors of war and marched back to the cuartel with it playing all coons look alike to me the next day mellinger takes me and henry to one side and begins to shed tens and twenties i want to buy that phonograph says he i liked that last tune it played at the soiree this is more money than the machine is worth says i tis government expense money says mellinger the government pays for it and it s getting the tune grinder cheap me and henry knew that pretty well we knew that it had saved homer p mellinger s graft when he was on the point of losing it but we never let him know we knew it now you boys better slide off further down the coast for a while says mellinger till i get the screws put on these fellows here if you don t they ll give you trouble and if you ever happen to see billy renfrew again before i do tell him i m coming back to new york as soon as i can make a stake honest me and henry laid low until the day the steamer came back when we saw the captain s boat on the beach we went down and stood in the edge of the water the captain grinned when he saw us i told you you d be waiting he says where s the hamburger machine it stays behind i says to play home sweet home i told you so says the captain again climb in the boat and that said keogh is the way me and henry horsecollar introduced the phonograph into this country henry went back to the states but i ve been rummaging around in the tropics ever since they say mellinger never travelled a mile after that without his phonograph i guess it kept him reminded about his graft whenever he saw the siren voice of the boodler tip him the wink with a bribe in his hand i suppose he s taking it home with him as a souvenir remarked the consul not as a souvenir said keogh he ll need two of em in new york running day and night vii money maze the new administration of anchuria entered upon its duties and privileges with enthusiasm its first act was to send an agent to coralio with imperative orders to recover if possible the sum of money ravished from the treasury by the ill fated miraflores colonel emilio falcon the private secretary of losada the new president was despatched from the capital upon this important mission the position of private secretary to a tropical president is a responsible one he must be a diplomat a spy a ruler of men a body guard to his chief and a smeller out of plots and nascent revolutions often he is the power behind the throne the dictator of policy and a president chooses him with a dozen times the care with which he selects a matrimonial mate colonel falcon a handsome and urbane gentleman of castilian courtesy and debonnaire manners came to coralio with the task before him of striking upon the cold trail of the lost money there he conferred with the military authorities who had received instructions to cooperate with him in the search colonel falcon established his headquarters in one of the rooms of the casa morena here for a week he held informal sittings much as if he were a kind of unified grand jury and summoned before him all those whose testimony might illumine the financial tragedy that had accompanied the less momentous one of the late president s death two or three who were thus examined among whom was the barber esteban declared that they had identified the body of the president before its burial of a truth testified esteban before the mighty secretary it was he the president consider how could i shave a man and not see his face he sent for me to shave him in a small house he had a beard very black and thick had i ever seen the president before why not i saw him once ride forth in a carriage from the vapor in solitas when i shaved him he gave me a gold piece and said there was to be no talk but i am a liberal i am devoted to my country and i spake of these things to senor goodwin it is known said colonel falcon smoothly that the late president took with him an american leather valise containing a large amount of money did you see that de veras no esteban answered the light in the little house was but a small lamp by which i could scarcely see to shave the president such a thing there may have been but i did not see it no also in the room was a young lady a senorita of much beauty that i could see even in so small a light but the money senor or the thing in which it was carried that i did not see the comandante and other officers gave testimony that they had been awakened and alarmed by the noise of a pistol shot in the hotel de los extranjeros hurrying thither to protect the peace and dignity of the republic they found a man lying dead with a pistol clutched in his hand beside him was a young woman weeping sorely senor goodwin was also in the room when they entered it but of the valise of money they saw nothing madame timotea ortiz the proprietress of the hotel in which the game of fox in the morning had been played out told of the coming of the two guests to her house to my house they came said she one senor not quite old and one senorita of sufficient handsomeness they desired not to eat or to drink not even of my aguardiente which is the best to their rooms they ascended numero nueve and numero diez later came senor goodwin who ascended to speak with them then i heard a great noise like that of a canon and they said that the pobre presidente had shot himself esta bueno i saw nothing of money or of the thing you call veliz that you say he carried it in colonel falcon soon came to the reasonable conclusion that if any one in coralio could furnish a clue to the vanished money frank goodwin must be the man but the wise secretary pursued a different course in seeking information from the american goodwin was a powerful friend to the new administration and one who was not to be carelessly dealt with in respect to either his honesty or his courage even the private secretary of his excellency hesitated to have this rubber prince and mahogany baron haled before him as a common citizen of anchuria so he sent goodwin a flowery epistle each word petal dripping with honey requesting the favor of an interview goodwin replied with an invitation to dinner at his own house before the hour named the american walked over to the casa morena and greeted his guest frankly and friendly then the two strolled in the cool of the afternoon to goodwin s home in the environs the american left colonel falcon in a big cool shadowed room with a floor of inlaid and polished woods that any millionaire in the states would have envied excusing himself for a few minutes he crossed a patio shaded with deftly arranged awnings and plants and entered a long room looking upon the sea in the opposite wing of the house the broad jalousies were opened wide and the ocean breeze flowed in through the room an invisible current of coolness and health goodwin s wife sat near one of the windows making a water color sketch of the afternoon seascape here was a woman who looked to be happy and more she looked to be content had a poet been inspired to pen just similes concerning her favor he would have likened her full clear eyes with their white encircled gray irises to moonflowers with none of the goddesses whose traditional charms have become coldly classic would the discerning rhymester have compared her she was purely paradisaic not olympian if you can imagine eve after the eviction beguiling the flaming warriors and serenely reentering the garden you will have her just so human and still so harmonious with eden seemed mrs goodwin when her husband entered she looked up and her lips curved and parted her eyelids fluttered twice or thrice a movement remindful proesy forgive us of the tail wagging of a faithful dog and a little ripple went through her like the commotion set up in a weeping willow by a puff of wind thus she ever acknowledged his coming were it twenty times a day if they who sometimes sat over their wine in coralio reshaping old diverting stories of the madcap career of isabel guilbert could have seen the wife of frank goodwin that afternoon in the estimable aura of her happy wifehood they might have disbelieved or have agreed to forget those graphic annals of the life of the one for whom their president gave up his country and his honor i have brought a guest to dinner said goodwin one colonel falcon from san mateo he is come on government business i do not think you will care to see him so i prescribe for you one of those convenient and indisputable feminine headaches he has come to inquire about the lost money has he not asked mrs goodwin going on with her sketch a good guess acknowledged goodwin he has been holding an inquisition among the natives for three days i am next on his list of witnesses but as he feels shy about dragging one of uncle sam s subjects before him he consents to give it the outward appearance of a social function he will apply the torture over my own wine and provender has he found any one who saw the valise of money not a soul even madama ortiz whose eyes are so sharp for the sight of a revenue official does not remember that there was any baggage mrs goodwin laid down her brush and sighed i am so sorry frank she said that they are giving you so much trouble about the money but we can t let them know about it can we not without doing our intelligence a great injustice said goodwin with a smile and a shrug that he had picked up from the natives americano though i am they would have me in the calaboza in half an hour if they knew we had appropriated that valise no we must appear as ignorant about the money as the other ignoramuses in coralio do you think that this man they have sent suspects you she asked with a little pucker of her brows he d better not said the american carelessly it s lucky that no one caught a sight of the valise except myself as i was in the rooms when the shot was fired it is not surprising that they should want to investigate my part in the affair rather closely but there s no cause for alarm this colonel is down on the list of events for a good dinner with a dessert of american bluff that will end the matter i think mrs goodwin rose and walked to the window goodwin followed and stood by her side she leaned to him and rested in the protection of his strength as she had always rested since that dark night on which he had first made himself her tower of refuge thus they stood for a little while straight through the lavish growth of tropical branch and leaf and vine that confronted them had been cunningly trimmed a vista that ended at the cleared environs of coralio on the banks of the mangrove swamp at the other end of the aerial tunnel they could see the grave and wooden headpiece that bore the name of the unhappy president miraflores from this window when the rains forbade the open and from the green and shady slopes of goodwin s fruitful lands when the skies were smiling his wife was wont to look upon that grave with a gentle sadness that was now scarcely a mar to her happiness i loved him so frank she said even after that terrible flight and its awful ending and you have been so good to me and have made me so happy it has all grown into such a strange puzzle if they were to find out that we got the money do you think they would force you to make the amount good to the government they would undoubtedly try answered goodwin you are right about its being a puzzle and it must remain a puzzle to falcon and all his countrymen until it solves itself you and i who know more than any one else only know half of the solution we must not let even a hint about this money get abroad let them come to the theory that the president concealed it in the mountains during his journey or that he found means to ship it out of the country before he reached coralio i don t think that falcon suspects me he is making a closer investigation according to his orders but he will find out nothing thus they spake together had any one overheard or overseen them as they discussed the lost funds of anchuria there would have been a second puzzle presented for upon the faces and in the bearing of each of them was visible if countenances are to be believed saxon honesty and pride and honorable thoughts in goodwin s steady eye and firm lineaments molded into material shape by the inward spirit of kindness and generosity and courage there was nothing reconcilable with his words as for his wife physiognomy championed her even in the face of their accusive talk nobility was in her guise purity was in her glance the devotion that she manifested had not even the appearance of that feeling that now and then inspires a woman to share the guilt of her partner out of the pathetic greatness other love no there was a discrepancy here between what the eye would have seen and the ear have heard dinner was served to goodwin and his guest in the patio under cool foliage and flowers the american begged the illustrious secretary to excuse the absence of mrs goodwin who was suffering he said from a headache brought on by a slight calentura after the meal they lingered according to the custom over their coffee and cigars colonel falcon with true castilian delicacy waited for his host to open the question that they had met to discuss he had not long to wait as soon as the cigars were lighted the american cleared the way by inquiring whether the secretary s investigations in the town had furnished him with any clue to the lost funds i have found no one yet admitted colonel falcon who even had sight of the valise or the money yet i have persisted it has been proven in the capital that president miraflores set out from san mateo with one hundred thousand dollars belonging to the government accompanied by senorita isabel guilbert the opera singer the government officially and personally is loathe to believe concluded colonel falcon with a smile that our late president s tastes would have permitted him to abandon on the route as excess baggage either of the desirable articles with which his flight was burdened i suppose you would like to hear what i have to say about the affair said goodwin coming directly to the point it will not require many words on that night with others of our friends here i was keeping a lookout for the president having been notified of his flight by a telegram in our national cipher from englehart one of our leaders in the capital about ten o clock that night i saw a man and a woman hurrying along the streets they went to the hotel de los extranjeros and engaged rooms i followed them upstairs leaving esteban who had come up to watch outside the barber had told me that he had shaved the beard from the president s face that night therefore i was prepared when i entered the rooms to find him with a smooth face when i apprehended him in the name of the people he drew a pistol and shot himself instantly in a few minutes many officers and citizens were on the spot i suppose you have been informed of the subsequent facts goodwin paused losada s agent maintained an attitude of waiting as if he expected a continuance and now went on the american looking steadily into the eyes of the other man and giving each word a deliberate emphasis you will oblige me by attending carefully to what i have to add i saw no valise or receptacle of any kind or any money belonging to the republic of anchuria if president miraflores decamped with any funds belonging to the treasury of this country or to himself or to any one else i saw no trace of it in the house or elsewhere at that time or at any other does that statement cover the ground of the inquiry you wished to make of me colonel falcon bowed and described a fluent curve with his cigar his duty was performed goodwin was not to be disputed he was a loyal supporter of the government and enjoyed the full confidence of the new president his rectitude had been the capital that had brought him fortune in anchuria just as it had formed the lucrative graft of mellinger the secretary of miraflores i thank you senor goodwin said falcon for speaking plainly but senor goodwin i am instructed to pursue every clue that presents itself in this matter there is one that i have not yet touched upon our friends in france senor have a saying cherchez la femme when there is a mystery without a clue but here we do not have to search the woman who accompanied the late president in his flight must surely i must interrupt you there interposed goodwin it is true that when i entered the hotel for the purpose of intercepting president miraflores i found a lady there i must beg of you to remember that that lady is now my wife i speak for her as i do for myself she knows nothing of the fate of the valise or of the money that you are seeking you will say to his excellency that i guarantee her innocence i do not need to add to you colonel falcon that i do not care to have her questioned or disturbed colonel falcon bowed again por supuesto no he cried and to indicate that the inquiry was ended he added and now senor let me beg of you to show me that sea view from your galeria of which you spoke i am a lover of the sea in the early evening goodwin walked back to the town with his guest leaving him at the corner of the calle grande as he was returning homeward one beelzebub blythe with the air of a courtier and the outward aspect of a scarecrow pounced upon him hopefully from the door of a pulperia blythe had been re christened beelzebub as an acknowledgement of the greatness of his fall once in some distant paradise lost he had foregathered with the angels of the earth but fate had hurled him headlong down to the tropics where flamed in his bosom a fire that was seldom quenched in coralio they called him a beach comber but he was in reality a categorical idealist who strove to anamorphosize the dull verities of life by the means of brandy and rum as beelzebub himself might have held in his clutch with unwitting tenacity his harp or crown during his tremendous fall so his namesake had clung to his gold rimmed eyeglasses as the only souvenir of his lost estate these he wore with impressiveness and distinction while he combed beaches and extracted toll from his friends by some mysterious means he kept his drink reddened face always smoothly shaven for the rest he sponged gracefully upon whomsoever he could for enough to keep him pretty drunk and sheltered from the rains and night dews hallo goodwin called the derelict airily i was hoping i d strike you i wanted to see you particularly suppose we go where we can talk of course you know there s a chap down here looking up the money old miraflores lost yes said goodwin i ve been talking with him let s go into espada s place i can spare you ten minutes they went into the pulperia and sat at a little table upon stools with rawhide tops have a drink said goodwin they can t bring it too quickly said blythe i ve been in a drought ever since morning hi muchacho el aguardiente por aca now what do you want to see me about asked goodwin when the drinks were before them confound it old man drawled blythe why do you spoil a golden moment like this with business i wanted to see you well this has the preference he gulped down his brandy and gazed longingly into the empty glass have another suggested goodwin between gentlemen said the fallen angel i don t quite like your use of that word another it isn t quite delicate but the concrete idea that the word represents is not displeasing the glasses were refilled blythe sipped blissfully from his as he began to enter the state of a true idealist i must trot along in a minute or two hinted goodwin was there anything in particular blythe did not reply at once old losada would make it a hot country he remarked at length for the man who swiped that gripsack of treasury boodle don t you think undoubtedly he would agreed goodwin calmly as he rose leisurely to his feet i ll be running over to the house now old man mrs goodwin is alone there was nothing important you had to say was there that s all said blythe unless you wouldn t mind sending in another drink from the bar as you go out old espada has closed my account to profit and loss and pay for the lot will you like a good fellow all right said goodwin buenas noches beezlebub blythe lingered over his cups polishing his eyeglasses with a disreputable handkerchief i thought i could do it but i couldn t he muttered to himself after a time a gentleman can t blackmail the man that he drinks with viii the admiral spilled milk draws few tears from an anchurian administration many are its lacteal sources and the clocks hands point forever to milking time even the rich cream skimmed from the treasury by the bewitched miraflores did not cause the newly installed patriots to waste time in unprofitable regrets the government philosophically set about supplying the deficiency by increasing the import duties and by suggesting to wealthy private citizens that contributions according to their means would be considered patriotic and in order prosperity was expected to attend the reign of losada the new president the ousted office holders and military favorites organized a new liberal party and began to lay their plans for a re succession thus the game of anchurian politics began like a chinese comedy to unwind slowly its serial length here and there mirth peeps for an instant from the wings and illumines the florid lines a dozen quarts of champagne in conjunction with an informal sitting of the president and his cabinet led to the establishment of the navy and the appointment of felipe carrera as its admiral next to the champagne the credit of the appointment belongs to don sabas placido the newly confirmed minister of war the president had requested a convention of his cabinet for the discussion of questions politic and for the transaction of certain routine matters of state the session had been signally tedious the business and the wine prodigiously dry a sudden prankish humor of don sabas impelling him to the deed spiced the grave affairs of state with a whiff of agreeable playfulness in the dilatory order of business had come a bulletin from the coast department of orilla del mar reporting the seizure by the custom house officers at the town of coralio of the sloop estrella del noche and her cargo of drygoods patent medicines granulated sugar and three star brandy also six martini rifles and a barrel of american whiskey caught in the act of smuggling the sloop with its cargo was now according to law the property of the republic the collector of customs in making his report departed from the conventional forms so far as to suggest that the confiscated vessel be converted to the use of the government the prize was the first capture to the credit of the department in ten years the collector took opportunity to pat his department on the back it often happened that government officers required transportation from point to point along the coast and means were usually lacking furthermore the sloop could be manned by a loyal crew and employed as a coast guard to discourage the pernicious art of smuggling the collector also ventured to nominate one to whom the charge of the boat could be safely intrusted a young man of coralio felipe carrera not be it understood one of extreme wisdom but loyal and the best sailor along the coast it was upon this hint that the minister of war acted executing a rare piece of drollery that so enlivened the tedium of the executive session in the consultation of this small maritime banana republic was a forgotten section that provided for the maintenance of a navy this provision with many other wiser ones had lain inert since the establishment of the republic anchuria had no navy and had no use for one it was characteristic of don sabas a man at once merry learned whimsical and audacious that he should have disturbed the dust of this musty and sleeping statute to increase the humor of the world by so much as a smile from his indulgent colleagues with delightful mock seriousness the minister of war proposed the creation of a navy he argued its need and the glories it might achieve with such gay and witty zeal that the travesty overcame with its humor even the swart dignity of president losada himself the champagne was bubbling trickily in the veins of the mercurial statesmen it was not the custom of the grave governors of anchuria to enliven their sessions with a beverage so apt to cast a veil of disparagement over sober affairs the wine had been a thoughtful compliment tendered by the agent of the vesuvius fruit company as a token of amicable relations and certain consummated deals between that company and the republic of anchuria the jest was carried to its end a formidable official document was prepared encrusted with chromatic seals and jaunty with fluttering ribbons bearing the florid signatures of state this commission conferred upon el senor don felipe carrera the title of flag admiral of the republic of anchuria thus within the space of a few minutes and the dominion of a dozen extra dry the country took its place among the naval powers of the world and felipe carrera became entitled to a salute of nineteen guns whenever he might enter port the southern races are lacking in that particular kind of humor that finds entertainment in the defects and misfortunes bestowed by nature owing to this defect in their constitution they are not moved to laughter as are their northern brothers by the spectacle of the deformed the feeble minded or the insane felipe carrera was sent upon earth with but half his wits therefore the people of coralio called him el pobrecito loco the poor little crazed one saying that god had sent but half of him to earth retaining the other half a sombre youth glowering and speaking only at the rarest times felipe was but negatively loco on shore he generally refused all conversation he seemed to know that he was badly handicapped on land where so many kinds of understanding are needed but on the water his one talent set him equal with most men few sailors whom god had carefully and completely made could handle a sailboat as well five points nearer the wind than the best of them he could sail his sloop when the elements raged and set other men to cowering the deficiencies of felipe seemed of little importance he was a perfect sailor if an imperfect man he owned no boat but worked among the crews of the schooners and sloops that skimmed the coast trading and freighting fruit out to the steamers where there was no harbor it was through his famous skill and boldness on the sea as well as for the pity felt for his mental imperfections that he was recommended by the collector as a suitable custodian of the captured sloop when the outcome of don sabas little pleasantry arrived in the form of the imposing and preposterous commission the collector smiled he had not expected such prompt and overwhelming response to his recommendation he despatched a muchacho at once to fetch the future admiral the collector waited in his official quarters his office was in the calle grande and the sea breezes hummed through its windows all day the collector in white linen and canvas shoes philandered with papers on an antique desk a parrot perched on a pen rack seasoned the official tedium with a fire of choice castilian imprecations two rooms opened into the collector s in one the clerical force of young men of variegated complexions transacted with glitter and parade their several duties through the open door of the other room could be seen a bronze babe guiltless of clothing that rollicked upon the floor in a grass hammock a thin woman tinted a pale lemon played a guitar and swung contentedly in the breeze thus surrounded by the routine of his high duties and the visible tokens of agreeable domesticity the collector s heart was further made happy by the power placed in his hands to brighten the fortunes of the innocent felipe felipe came and stood before the collector he was a lad of twenty not ill favored in looks but with an expression of distant and pondering vacuity he wore white cotton trousers down the seams of which he had sewed red stripes with some vague aim at military decoration a flimsy blue shirt fell open at his throat his feet were bare he held in his hand the cheapest of straw hats from the states senor carrera said the collector gravely producing the showy commission i have sent for you at the president s bidding this document that i present to you confers upon you the title of admiral of this great republic and gives you absolute command of the naval forces and fleet of our country you may think friend felipe that we have no navy but yes the sloop the estrella del noche that my brave men captured from the coast smugglers is to be placed under your command the boat is to be devoted to the services of your country you will be ready at all times to convey officials of the government to points along the coast where they may be obliged to visit you will also act as a coast guard to prevent as far as you may be able the crime of smuggling you will uphold the honor and prestige of your country at sea and endeavor to place anchuria among the proudest naval powers of the world these are your instructions as the minister of war desires me to convey them to you por dios i do not know how all this is to be accomplished for not one word did his letter contain in respect to a crew or to the expenses of this navy perhaps you are to provide a crew yourself senor admiral i do not know but it is a very high honor that has descended upon you i now hand you your commission when you are ready for the boat i will give orders that she shall be made over into your charge that is as far as my instructions go felipe took the commission that the collector handed to him he gazed through the open window at the sea for a moment with his customary expression of deep but vain pondering then he turned without having spoken a word and walked swiftly away through the hot sand of the street pobrecito loco sighed the collector and the parrot on the pen racks screeched loco loco loco the next morning a strange procession filed through the streets to the collector s office at its head was the admiral of the navy somewhere felipe had raked together a pitiful semblance of a military uniform a pair of red trousers a dingy blue short jacket heavily ornamented with gold braid and an old fatigue cap that must have been cast away by one of the british soldiers in belize and brought away by felipe on one of his coasting voyages buckled around his waist was an ancient ship s cutlass contributed to his equipment by pedro lafitte the baker who proudly asserted its inheritance from his ancestor the illustrious buccaneer at the admiral s heels tagged his newly shipped crew three grinning glossy black caribs bare to the waist the sand spurting in showers from the spring of their naked feet briefly and with dignity felipe demanded his vessel of the collector and now a fresh honor awaited him the collector s wife who played the guitar and read novels in the hammock all day had more than a little romance in her placid yellow bosom she had found in an old book an engraving of a flag that purported to be the naval flag of anchuria perhaps it had so been designed by the founders of the nation but as no navy had ever been established oblivion had claimed the flag laboriously with her own hands she had made a flag after the pattern a red cross upon a blue and white ground he presented it to felipe with these words brave sailor this flag is of your country be true and defend it with your life go you with god for the first time since his appointment the admiral showed a flicker of emotion he took the silken emblem and passed his hand reverently over its surface i am the admiral he said to the collector s lady being on land he could bring himself to no more exuberant expression of sentiment at sea with the flag at the masthead of his navy some more eloquent exposition of feelings might be forthcoming abruptly the admiral departed with his crew for the next three days they were busy giving the estrella del noche a new coat of white paint trimmed with blue and then felipe further adorned himself by fastening a handful of brilliant parrot s plumes in his cap again he tramped with his faithful crew to the collector s office and formally notified him that the sloop s name had been changed to el nacional during the next few months the navy had its troubles even an admiral is perplexed to know what to do without any orders but none came neither did any salaries el nacional swung idly at anchor when felipe s little store of money was exhausted he went to the collector and raised the question of finances salaries exclaimed the collector with hands raised valgame dios not one centavo of my own pay have i received for the last seven months the pay of an admiral do you ask quien sabe should it be less than three thousand pesos mira you will see a revolution in this country very soon a good sign of it is when the government calls all the time for pesos pesos pesos and pays none out felipe left the collector s office with a look almost of content on his sombre face a revolution would mean fighting and then the government would need his services it was rather humiliating to be an admiral without anything to do and have a hungry crew at your heels begging for reales to buy plantains and tobacco with when he returned to where his happy go lucky caribs were waiting they sprang up and saluted as he had drilled them to do come muchachos said the admiral it seems that the government is poor it has no money to give us we will earn what we need to live upon thus will we serve our country soon his heavy eyes almost lighted up it may gladly call upon us for help thereafter el nacional turned out with the other coast craft and became a wage earner she worked with the lighters freighting bananas and oranges out to the fruit steamers that could not approach nearer than a mile from the shore surely a self supporting navy deserves red letters in the budget of any nation after earning enough at freighting to keep himself and his crew in provisions for a week felipe would anchor the navy and hang about the little telegraph office looking like one of the chorus of an insolvent comic opera troupe besieging the manager s den a hope for orders from the capital was always in his heart that his services as admiral had never been called into requirement hurt his pride and patriotism at every call he would inquire gravely and expectantly for despatches the operator would pretend to make a search and then reply not yet it seems senor el almirante poco tiempo outside in the shade of the lime trees the crew chewed sugar cane or slumbered well content to serve a country that was contented with so little service one day in the early summer the revolution predicted by the collector flamed out suddenly it had long been smoldering at the first note of alarm the admiral of the navy force and fleet made all sail for a larger port on the coast of a neighboring republic where he traded a hastily collected cargo of fruit for its value in cartridges for the five martini rifles the only guns that the navy could boast then to the telegraph office sped the admiral sprawling in his favorite corner in his fast decaying uniform with his prodigious sabre distributed between his red legs he waited for the long delayed but now soon expected orders not yet senor el almirante the telegraph clerk would call to him poco tiempo at the answer the admiral would plump himself down with a great rattling of scabbard to await the infrequent tick of the little instrument on the table they will come would be his unshaken reply i am the admiral ix the flag paramount at the head of the insurgent party appeared that hector and learned theban of the southern republics don sabas placido a traveller a soldier a poet a scientist a statesman and a connoisseur the wonder was that he could content himself with the petty remote life of his native country it is a whim of placido s said a friend who knew him well to take up political intrigue it is not otherwise than as if he had come upon a new tempo in music a new bacillus in the air a new scent or rhyme or explosive he will squeeze this revolution dry of sensations and a week afterward will forget it skimming the seas of the world in his brigantine to add to his already world famous collections collections of what por dios of everything from postage stamps to prehistoric stone idols but for a mere dilettante the aesthetic placido seemed to be creating a lively row the people admired him they were fascinated by his brilliancy and flattered by his taking an interest in so small a thing as his native country they rallied to the call of his lieutenants in the capital where somewhat contrary to arrangements the army remained faithful to the government there was also lively skirmishing in the coast towns it was rumored that the revolution was aided by the vesuvius fruit company the power that forever stood with chiding smile and uplifted finger to keep anchuria in the class of good children two of its steamers the traveler and the salvador were known to have conveyed insurgent troops from point to point along the coast as yet there had been no actual uprising in coralio military law prevailed and the ferment was bottled for the time and then came the word that everywhere the revolutionists were encountering defeat in the capital the president s forces triumphed and there was a rumor that the leaders of the revolt had been forced to fly hotly pursued in the little telegraph office at coralio there was always a gathering of officials and loyal citizens awaiting news from the seat of government one morning the telegraph key began clicking and presently the operator called loudly one telegram for el almirante don senor felipe carrera there was a shuffling sound a great rattling of tin scabbard and the admiral prompt at his spot of waiting leaped across the room to receive it the message was handed to him slowly spelling it out he found it to be his first official order thus running proceed immediately with your vessel to mouth of rio ruiz transport beef and provisions to barracks at alforan martinez general small glory to be sure in this his country s first call but it had called and joy surged in the admiral s breast he drew his cutlass belt to another buckle hole roused his dozing crew and in a quarter of an hour el nacional was tacking swiftly down coast in a stiff landward breeze the rio ruiz is a small river emptying into the sea ten miles below coralio that portion of the coast is wild and solitary through a gorge in the cordilleras rushes the rio ruiz cold and bubbling to glide at last with breadth and leisure through an alluvial morass into the sea in two hours el nacional entered the river s mouth the banks were crowded with a disposition of formidable trees the sumptuous undergrowth of the tropics overflowed the land and drowned itself in the fallow waters silently the sloop entered there and met a deeper silence brilliant with greens and ochres and floral scarlets the umbrageous mouth of the rio ruiz furnished no sound or movement save of the sea going water as it purled against the prow of the vessel small chance there seemed of wresting beef or provisions from that empty solitude the admiral decided to cast anchor and at the chain s rattle the forest was stimulated to instant and resounding uproar the mouth of the rio ruiz had only been taking a morning nap parrots and baboons screeched and barked in the trees a whirring and a hissing and a booming marked the awakening of animal life a dark blue bulk was visible for an instant as a startled tapir fought his way through the vines the navy under orders hung in the mouth of the little river for hours the crew served the dinner of shark s fin soup plantains crab gumbo and sour wine the admiral with a three foot telescope closely scanned the impervious foliage fifty yards away it was nearly sunset when a reverberating hal lo o o came from the forest to their left it was answered and three men mounted upon mules crashed through the tropic tangle to within a dozen yards of the river s bank there they dismounted and one unbuckling his belt struck each mule a violent blow with his sword scabbard so that they with a fling of heels dashed back again into the forest those were strange looking men to be conveying beef and provisions one was a large and exceedingly active man of striking presence he was of the purest spanish type with curling gray besprinkled dark hair blue sparkling eyes and the pronounced air of a caballero grande the other two were small brown faced men wearing white military uniforms high riding boots and swords the clothes of all were drenched bespattered and rent by the thicket some stress of circumstance must have driven them diable a quatre through flood mire and jungle o he senor almirante called the large man send to us your boat the dory was lowered and felipe with one of the caribs rowed toward the left bank the large man stood near the water s brink waist deep in the curling vines as he gazed upon the scarecrow figure in the stern of the dory a sprightly interest beamed upon his mobile face months of wageless and thankless service had dimmed the admiral s splendor his red trousers were patched and ragged most of the bright buttons and yellow braid were gone from his jacket the visor of his cap was torn and depended almost to his eyes the admiral s feet were bare dear admiral cried the large man and his voice was like a blast from a horn i kiss your hands i knew we could build upon your fidelity you had our despatch from general martinez a little nearer with your boat dear admiral upon these devils of shifting vines we stand with the smallest security felipe regarded him with a stolid face provisions and beef for the barracks at alforan he quoted no fault of the butchers almirante mio that the beef awaits you not but you are come in time to save the cattle get us aboard your vessel senor at once you first caballeros a priesa come back for me the boat is too small the dory conveyed the two officers to the sloop and returned for the large man have you so gross a thing as food good admiral he cried when aboard and perhaps coffee beef and provisions nombre de dios a little longer and we could have eaten one of those mules that you colonel rafael saluted so feelingly with your sword scabbard at parting let us have food and then we will sail for the barracks at alforan no the caribs prepared a meal to which the three passengers of el nacional set themselves with famished delight about sunset as was its custom the breeze veered and swept back from the mountains cool and steady bringing a taste of the stagnant lagoons and mangrove swamps that guttered the lowlands the mainsail of the sloop was hoisted and swelled to it and at that moment they heard shouts and a waxing clamor from the bosky profundities of the shore the butchers my dear admiral said the large man smiling too late for the slaughter further than his orders to his crew the admiral was saying nothing the topsail and jib were spread and the sloop elided out of the estuary the large man and his companions had bestowed themselves with what comfort they could about the bare deck belike the thing big in their minds had been their departure from that critical shore and now that the hazard was so far reduced their thoughts were loosed to the consideration of further deliverance but when they saw the sloop turn and fly up coast again they relaxed satisfied with the course the admiral had taken the large man sat at ease his spirited blue eye engaged in the contemplation of the navy s commander he was trying to estimate this sombre and fantastic lad whose impenetrable stolidity puzzled him himself a fugitive his life sought and chafing under the smart of defeat and failure it was characteristic of him to transfer instantly his interest to the study of a thing new to him it was like him too to have conceived and risked all upon this last desperate and madcap scheme this message to a poor crazed fanatico cruising about with his grotesque uniform and his farcical title but his companions had been at their wits end escape had seemed incredible and now he was pleased with the success of the plan they had called crack brained and precarious the brief tropic twilight seemed to slide swiftly into the pearly splendor of a moonlit night and now the lights of coralio appeared distributed against the darkening shore to their right the admiral stood silent at the tiller the caribs like black panthers held the sheets leaping noiselessly at his short commands the three passengers were watching intently the sea before them and when at length they came in sight of the bulk of a steamer lying a mile out from the town with her lights radiating deep into the water they held a sudden voluble and close headed converse the sloop was speeding as if to strike midway between ship and shore the large man suddenly separated from his companions and approached the scarecrow at the helm my dear admiral he said the government has been exceedingly remiss i feel all the shame for it that only its ignorance of your devoted service has prevented it from sustaining an inexcusable oversight has been made a vessel a uniform and a crew worthy of your fidelity shall be furnished you but just now dear admiral there is business of moment afoot the steamer lying there is the salvador i and my friends desire to be conveyed to her where we are sent on the government s business do us the favor to shape your course accordingly without replying the admiral gave a sharp command and put the tiller hard to port el nacional swerved and headed straight as an arrow s course for the shore do me the favor said the large man a trifle restively to acknowledge at least that you catch the sound of my words it was possible that the fellow might be lacking in senses as well as intellect the admiral emitted a croaking harsh laugh and spake they will stand you he said with your face to a wall and shoot you dead that is the way they kill traitors i knew you when you stepped into my boat i have seen your picture in a book you are sabas placido traitor to your country with your face to a wall so you will die i am the admiral and i will take you to them with your face to a wall yes don sabas half turned and waved his hand with a ringing laugh toward his fellow fugitives to you caballeros i have related the history of that session when we issued that so ridiculous commission of a truth our jest has been turned against us behold the frankenstein s monster we have created don sabas glanced toward the shore the lights of coralio were drawing near he could see the beach the warehouse of the bodega nacional the long low cuartel occupied by the soldiers and behind that gleaming in the moonlight a stretch of high adobe wall he had seen men stood with their faces to that wall and shot dead again he addressed the extravagant figure at the helm it is true he said that i am fleeing the country but receive the assurance that i care very little for that courts and camps everywhere are open to sabas placido vaya what is this molehill of a republic this pig s head of a country to a man like me i am a paisano of everywhere in rome in london in paris in vienna you will hear them say welcome back don sabas come tonto baboon of a boy admiral whatever you call yourself turn your boat put us on board the salvador and here is your pay five hundred pesos in money of the estados unidos more than your lying government will pay you in twenty years don sabas pressed a plump purse against the youth s hand the admiral gave no heed to the words or the movement braced against the helm he was holding the sloop dead on her shoreward course his dull face was lit almost to intelligence by some inward conceit that seemed to afford him joy and found utterance in another parrot like cackle that is why they do it he said so that you will not see the guns they fire boom and you fall dead with your face to the wall yes the admiral called a sudden order to his crew the lithe silent caribs made fast the sheets they held and slipped down the hatchway into the hold of the sloop when the last one had disappeared don sabas like a big brown leopard leaped forward closed and fastened the hatch and stood smiling no rifles if you please dear admiral he said it was a whimsey of mine once to compile a dictionary of the carib lengua so i understood your order perhaps now you will he cut short his words for he heard the dull swish of iron scraping along tin the admiral had drawn the cutlass of pedro lafitte and was darting upon him the blade descended and it was only by a display of surprising agility that the large man escaped with only a bruised shoulder the glancing weapon he was drawing his pistol as he sprang and the next instant he shot the admiral down don sabas stooped over him and rose again in the heart he said briefly senores the navy is abolished colonel rafael sprang to the helm and the other officer hastened to loose the mainsail sheets the boom swung round el nacional veered and began to tack industriously for the salvador strike that flag senor called colonel rafael our friends on the steamer will wonder why we are sailing under it well said cried don sabas advancing to the mast he lowered the flag to the deck where lay its too loyal supporter thus ended the minister of war s little piece of after dinner drollery and by the same hand that began it suddenly don sabas gave a great cry of joy and ran down the slanting deck to the side of colonel rafael across his arm he carried the flag of the extinguished navy mire mire senor ah dios already can i hear that great bear of an oestreicher shout du hast mein herz gebrochen mire of my friend herr grunitz of vienna you have heard me relate that man has travelled to ceylon for an orchid to patagonia for a headdress to benares for a slipper to mozambique for a spearhead to add to his famous collections thou knowest also amigo rafael that i have been a gatherer of curios my collection of battle flags of the world s navies was the most complete in existence until last year then herr grunitz secured two such rare specimens one of a barberry state and one of the makarooroos a tribe on the west coast of africa i have not those but they can be procured but this flag senor do you know what it is name of god do you know see that red cross upon the blue and white ground you never saw it before seguramente no it is the naval flag of your country mire this rotten tub we stand upon is its navy that dead cockatoo lying there was its commander that stroke of cutlass and single pistol shot a sea battle all a piece of absurd foolery i grant you but authentic there has never been another flag like this and there never will be another no it is unique in the whole world yes think of what that means to a collector of flags do you know coronel mio how many golden crowns herr grunitz would give for this flag ten thousand likely well a hundred thousand would not buy it beautiful flag only flag little devil of a most heaven born flag o he old grumbler beyond the ocean wait till don sabas comes again to the konigin strasse he will let you kneel and touch the folds of it with one finger o he old spectacled ransacker of the world forgotten was the impotent revolution the danger the loss the gall of defeat possessed solely by the inordinate and unparalleled passion of the collector he strode up and down the little deck clasping to his breast with one hand the paragon of a flag he snapped his fingers triumphantly toward the east he shouted the paean to his prize in trumpet tones as though he would make old grunitz hear in his musty den beyond the sea they were waiting on the salvador to welcome them the sloop came close alongside the steamer where her sides were sliced almost to the lower deck for the loading of fruit the sailors of the salvador grappled and held her there captain mcleod leaned over the side well senor the jig is up i m told the jig is up don sabas looked perplexed for a moment that revolution ah yes with a shrug of his shoulders he dismissed the matter the captain learned of the escape and the imprisoned crew caribs he said no harm in them he slipped down into the sloop and kicked loose the hasp of the hatch the black fellows came tumbling up sweating but grinning hey black boys said the captain in a dialect of his own you sabe catchy boat and vamos back same place quick they saw him point to themselves the sloop and coralio yas yas they cried with broader grins and many nods the four don sabas the two officers and the captain moved to quit the sloop don sabas lagged a little behind looking at the still form of the late admiral sprawled in his paltry trappings pobrecito loco he said softly he was a brilliant cosmopolite and a cognoscente of high rank but after all he was of the same race and blood and instinct as this people even as the simple paisanos of coralio had said it so said don sabas without a smile he looked and said the poor little crazed one stooping he raised the limp shoulders drew the priceless and induplicable flag under them and over the breast pinning it there with the diamond star of the order of san carlos that he took from the collar of his own coat he followed after the others and stood with them upon the deck of the salvador the sailors that steadied el nacional shoved her off the jabbering caribs hauled away at the rigging the sloop headed for the shore and herr grunitz s collection of naval flags was still the finest in the world x the shamrock and the palm one night when there was no breeze and coralio seemed closer than ever to the gratings of avernus five men were grouped about the door of the photograph establishment of keogh and clancy thus in all the scorched and exotic places of the earth caucasians meet when the day s work is done to preserve the fulness of their heritage by the aspersion of alien things johnny atwood lay stretched upon the grass in the undress uniform of a carib and prated feebly of cool water to be had in the cucumber wood pumps of dalesburg doctor gregg through the prestige of his whiskers and as a bribe against the relation of his imminent professional tales was conceded the hammock that was swung between the door jamb and a calabash tree keogh had moved out upon the grass a little table that held the instrument for burnishing completed photographs he was the only busy one of the group industriously from between the cylinders of the burnisher rolled the finished depictments of coralio s citizens blanchard the french mining engineer in his cool linen viewed the smoke of his cigarette through his calm glasses impervious to the heat clancy sat on the steps smoking his short pipe his mood was the gossip s the others were reduced by the humidity to the state of disability desirable in an audience clancy was an american with an irish diathesis and cosmopolitan proclivities many businesses had claimed him but not for long the roadster s blood was in his veins the voice of the tintype was but one of the many callings that had wooed him upon so many roads sometimes he could be persuaded to oral construction of his voyages into the informal and egregious tonight there were symptoms of divulgement in him tis elegant weather for filibustering he volunteered it reminds me of the time i struggled to liberate a nation from the poisonous breath of a tyrant s clutch twas hard work tis straining to the back and makes corns on the hands i didn t know you had ever lent your sword to an oppressed people murmured atwood from the grass i did said clancy and they turned it into a plowshare what country was so fortunate as to secure your aid airily inquired blanchard where s kamchatka asked clancy with seeming irrelevance why off siberia somewhere in the arctic regions somebody answered doubtfully i thought that was the cold one said clancy with a satisfied nod i m always gettin the two names mixed twas guatemala then the hot one i ve been filibusterin with ye ll find that country on the map tis in the district known as the tropics by the foresight of providence it lies on the coast so the geography men could run the names of the towns off into the water they re an inch long small type composed of spanish dialects and tis my opinion of the same system of syntax that blew up the maine yes twas that country i sailed against single handed and endeavored to liberate it from a tyrannical government with a single barrelled pickaxe unloaded at that ye don t understand of course tis a statement demandin elucidation and apologies twas in new orleans one morning about the first ofjune i was standing down on the wharf looking about at the ships in the river there was a little steamer moored right opposite me that seemed about ready to sail the funnels of it were throwing out smoke and a gang of roustabouts were carrying aboard a pile of boxes that was stacked up on the wharf the boxes were about two feet square and something like four feet long and they seemed to be pretty heavy i walked over careless to the stack of boxes i saw one of them had been broken in handlin twas curiosity made me pull up the loose top and look inside the box was packed full of winchester rifles so so says i to myself somebody s gettin a twist on the neutrality laws somebody s aidin with munitions of war i wonder where the popguns are goin i heard somebody cough and i turned around there stood a little round fat man with a brown face and white clothes a first class looking little man with a four karat diamond on his finger and his eye full of interrogations and respects i judged he was a kind of foreigner may be from russia or japan or the archipelagoes hist says the round man full of concealments and confidences will the senor respect the discoveryments he has made that the mans on the ship shall not be acquaint the senor will be a gentleman that shall not expose one thing that by accident occur monseer says i for i judged him to be a kind of frenchman receive my most exasperated assurances that your secret is safe with james clancy furthermore i will go so far as to remark veev la liberty veev it good and strong whenever you hear of a clancy obstructin the abolishment of existin governments you may notify me by return mail the senor is good says the dark fat man smilin under his black mustache wish you to come aboard my ship and drink of wine a glass bein a clancy in two minutes me and the foreigner man were seated at a table in the cabin of the steamer with a bottle between us i could hear the heavy boxes bein dumped into the hold i judged that cargo must consist of at least winchesters me and the brown man drank the bottle of stuff and he called the steward to bring another when you amalgamate a clancy with the contents of a bottle you practically instigate secession i had heard a good deal about these revolutions in them tropical localities and i begun to want a hand in it you goin to stir things up in your country ain t you monseer says i with a wink to let him know i was on yes yes said the little man pounding his fist on the table a change of the greatest will occur too long have the people been oppressed with the promises and the never to happen things to become the great work it shall be carry on yes our forces shall in the capital city strike of the soonest carrambos carrambos is the word says i beginning to invest myself with enthusiasm and more wine likewise veeva as i said before may the shamrock of old i mean the banana vine or the pie plant or whatever the imperial emblem may be of your down trodden country wave forever a thousand thank yous says the round man for your emission of amicable utterances what our cause needs of the very most is mans who will the work do to lift it along oh for one thousands strong good mans to aid the general de vega that he shall to his country bring those success and glory it is hard oh so hard to find good mans to help in the work monseer says i leanin over the table and graspin his hand i don t know where your country is but me heart bleeds for it the heart of a clancy was never deaf to the sight of an oppressed people the family is filibusterers by birth and foreigners by trade if you can use james clancy s arms and his blood in denuding your shores of the tyrant s yoke they re yours to command general de vega was overcome with joy to confiscate my condolence of his conspiracies and predicaments he tried to embrace me across the table but his fatness and the wine that had been in the bottles prevented thus was i welcomed into the ranks of filibustery then the general man told me his country had the name of guatemala and was the greatest nation laved by any ocean whatever anywhere he looked at me with tears in his eyes and from time to time he would emit the remark ah big strong brave mans that is what my country need general de vega as was the name by which he denounced himself brought out a document for me to sign which i did makin a fine flourish and curlycue with the tail of the y your passage money says the general business like shall from your pay be deduct twill not says i haughty i ll pay my own passage a hundred and eighty dollars i had in my inside pocket and twas no common filibuster i was goin to be filibusterin for me board and clothes the steamer was to sail in two hours and i went ashore to get some things together i d need when i came aboard i showed the general with pride the outfit twas a fine chinchilla overcoat arctic overshoes fur cap and earmuffs with elegant fleece lined gloves and woollen muffler carrambos says the little general what clothes are these that shall go to the tropic and then the little spalpeen laughs and he calls the captain and the captain calls the purser and they pipe up the chief engineer and the whole gang leans against the cabin and laughs at clancy s wardrobe for guatemala i reflects a bit serious and asks the general again to denominate the terms by which his country is called he tells me and i see then that twas the t other one kamchatka i had in mind since then i ve had difficulty in separatin the two nations in name climate and geographic disposition i paid my passage twenty four dollars first cabin and ate at table with the officer crowd down on the lower deck was a gang of second class passengers about forty of them seemin to be dagoes and the like i wondered what so many of them were goin along for well then in three days we sailed alongside that guatemala twas a blue country and not yellow as tis miscolored on the map we landed at a town on the coast where a train of cars was waitin for us on a dinky little railroad the boxes on the steamer were brought ashore and loaded on the cars the gang of dagoes got aboard too the general and me in the front car yes me and general de vega headed the revolution as it pulled out of the seaport town that train travelled about as fast as a policeman goin to a riot it penetrated the most conspicuous lot of fuzzy scenery ever seen outside a geography we run some forty miles in seven hours and the train stopped there was no more railroad twas a sort of camp in a damp gorge full of wildness and melancholies they was grading and choppin out the forests ahead to continue the road here says i to myself is the romantic haunt of the revolutionists here will clancy by the virtue that is in a superior race and the inculcation of fenian tactics strike a tremendous blow for liberty they unloaded the boxes from the train and begun to knock the tops off from the first one that was open i saw general de vega take the winchester rifles and pass them around to a squad of morbid soldiery the other boxes was opened next and believe me or not divil another gun was to be seen every other box in the load was full of pickaxes and spades and then sorrow be upon them tropics the proud clancy and the dishonored dagoes each one of them had to shoulder a pick or a spade and march away to work on that dirty little railroad yes twas that the dagoes shipped for and twas that the filibusterin clancy signed for though unbeknownst to himself at the time in after days i found out about it it seems twas hard to get hands to work on that road the intelligent natives of the country was too lazy to work indeed the saints know twas unnecessary by stretchin out one hand they could seize the most delicate and costly fruits of the earth and by stretchin out the other they could sleep for days at a time without hearin a seven o clock whistle or the footsteps of the rent man upon the stairs so regular the steamers travelled to the united states to seduce labor usually the imported spade slingers died in two or three months from eatin the over ripe water and breathing the violent tropical scenery wherefore they made them sign contracts for a year when they hired them and put an armed guard over the poor devils to keep them from runnin away twas thus i was double crossed by the tropics through a family failing of goin out of the way to hunt disturbances they gave me a pick and i took it meditating an insurrection on the spot but there was the guards handling the winchesters careless and i come to the conclusion that discretion was the best part of filibusterin there was about a hundred of us in the gang starting out to work and the word was given to move i steps out of the ranks and goes up to that general de vega man who was smokin a cigar and gazin upon the scene with satisfactions and glory he smiles at me polite and devilish plenty work says he for big strong mans in guatemala yes thirty dollars in the month good pay ah yes you strong brave man bimeby we push those railroad in the capital very quick they want you go work now adios strong mans monseer says i lingerin will you tell a poor little irishman this when i set foot on your cockroachy steamer and breathed liberal and revolutionary sentiments into your sour wine did you think i was conspirin to sling a pick on your contemptuous little railroad and when you answered me with patriotic recitations humping up the star spangled cause of liberty did you have meditations of reducin me to the ranks of the stump grubbin dagoes in the chain gangs of your vile and grovelin country the general man expanded his rotundity and laughed considerable yes he laughed very long and loud and i clancy stood and waited comical mans he shouts at last so you will kill me from the laughing yes it is hard to find the brave strong mans to aid my country revolutions did i speak of r r revolutions not one word i say big strong man is need in guatemala so the mistake is of you you have looked in those one box containing those gun for the guard you think all boxes is contain gun no there is not war in guatemala but work yes good thirty dollar in the month you shall shoulder one pickaxe senor and dig for the liberty and prosperity of guatemala off to your work the guard waits for you little fat poodle dog of a brown man says i quiet but full of indignations and discomforts things shall happen to you maybe not right away but as soon as j clancy can formulate somethin in the way of repartee the boss of the gang orders us to work i tramps off with the dagoes and i hears the distinguished patriot and kidnapper laughin hearty as we go tis a sorrowful fact for eight weeks i built railroads for that misbehavin country i filibustered twelve hours a day with a heavy pick and a spade choppin away the luxurious landscape that grew upon the right of way we worked in swamps that smelled like there was a leak in the gas mains trampin down a fine assortment of the most expensive hothouse plants and vegetables the scene was tropical beyond the wildest imagination of the geography man the trees was all sky scrapers the underbrush was full of needles and pins there was monkeys jumpin around and crocodiles and pink tailed mockin birds and ye stood knee deep in the rotten water and grabbled roots for the liberation of guatemala of nights we would build smudges in camp to discourage the mosquitoes and sit in the smoke with the guards pacin all around us there was two hundred men working on the road mostly dagoes nigger men spanish men and swedes three or four were irish one old man named halloran a man of hibernian entitlements and discretions explained it to me he had been working on the road a year most of them died in less than six months he was dried up to gristle and bone and shook with chills every third night when you first come says he ye think ye ll leave right away but they hold out your first month s pay for your passage over and by that time the tropics has its grip on ye ye re surrounded by a ragin forest full of disreputable beasts lions and baboons and anacondas waiting to devour ye the sun strikes ye hard and melts the marrow in your bones ye get similar to the lettuce eaters the poetry books speaks about ye forget the elevated sintiments of life such as patriotism revenge disturbances of the peace and the dacint love of a clane shirt ye do your work and ye swallow the kerosene ile and rubber pipestems dished up to ye by the dago cook for food ye light your pipeful and say to yourself nixt week i ll break away and ye go to sleep and call yersilf a liar for ye know yell never do it who is this general man asks i that calls himself de vega tis the man says halloran who is tryin to complete the finishin of the railroad twas the project of a private corporation but it busted and then the government took it up de vegy is a big politician and wants to be president the people want the railroad completed as they re taxed mighty on account of it the de vegy man is pushing it along as a campaign move tis not my way says i to make threats against any man but there s an account to be settled between the railroad man and james o dowd clancy twas that way i thought mesilf at first halloran says with a big sigh until i got to be a lettuce eater the fault s wid these tropics they rejuices a man s system tis a land as the poet says where it always seems to be after dinner i does me work and smokes me pipe and sleeps there s little else in life anyway ye ll get that way yersilf mighty soon don t be harborin any sentiments at all clancy i can t help it says i i m full of em i enlisted in the revolutionary army of this dark country in good faith to fight for its liberty honors and silver candlesticks instead of which i am set to amputatin its scenery and grubbin its roots tis the general man will have to pay for it two months i worked on that railroad before i found a chance to get away one day a gang of us was sent back to the end of the completed line to fetch some picks that had been sent down to port barrios to be sharpened they were brought on a hand car and i noticed when i started away that the car was left there on the track that night about twelve i woke up halloran and told him my scheme run away says halloran good lord clancy do ye mean it why i ain t got the nerve it s too chilly and i ain t slept enough run away i told you clancy i ve eat the lettuce i ve lost my grip tis the tropics that s done it tis like the poet says forgotten are our friends that we have left behind in the hollow lettuce land we will live and lay reclined you better go on clancy i ll stay i guess it s too early and cold and i m sleepy so i had to leave halloran i dressed quiet and slipped out of the tent we were in when the guard came along i knocked him over like a ninepin with a green coconut i had and made for the railroad i got on that hand car and made it fly twas yet a while before daybreak when i saw the lights of port barrios about a mile away i stopped the hand car there and walked to the town i stepped inside the corporations of that town with care and hesitations i was not afraid of the army of guatemala but me soul quaked at the prospect of a hand to hand struggle with its employment bureau tis a country that hires its help easy and keeps em long sure i can fancy missis america and missis guatemala passin a bit of gossip some fine still night across the mountains oh dear says missis america and it s a lot of trouble i m havin ag in with the help senora ma am laws now says missis guatemala you don t say so ma am now mine never think ofleavin me te he ma am snickers missis guatemala i was wonderin how i was goin to move away from them tropics without bein hired again dark as it was i could see a steamer ridin in the harbor

savve english heap plenty yes says he with a pleasant grin what steamer is that i asks him and where is it going and what s the news and the good word and the time of day that steamer the conchita

vega verree much they want catchee him for shoot you think they catchee that general senor saints grant it says i twould be the judgment of providence for settin the warlike talent of a clancy to gradin the tropics with a pick and shovel but tis not so much a question of insurrections now me little man as tis of the hired man problem tis anxious i am to resign a situation of responsibility and trust with the white wings department of your great and degraded country row me in your little boat out to that steamer and i ll give ye five dollars sinker pacers sinker pacers says i reducing the offer to the language and denomination of the tropic dialects cinco pesos repeats the little man five dollee you give twas not such a bad little man he had hesitations at first sayin that passengers leavin the country had to have papers and passports but at last he took me out alongside the steamer day was just breakin as we struck her and there wasn t a soul to be seen on board the water was very still and the nigger man gave me a lift from the boat and i climbed onto the steamer where her side was sliced to the deck for loadin fruit the hatches was open and i looked down and saw the cargo of bananas that filled the hold to within six feet of the top i thinks to myself clancy you better go as a stowaway it s safer the steamer men might hand you back to the employment bureau the tropic ll get you clancy if you don t watch out so i jumps down easy among the bananas and digs out a hole to hide in among the bunches in an hour or so i could hear the engines goin and feel the steamer rockin and i knew we were off to sea they left the hatches open for ventilation and pretty soon it was light enough in the hold to see fairly well i got to feelin a bit hungry and thought i d have a light fruit lunch by way of refreshment i creeped out of the hole i d made and stood up straight just then i saw another man crawl up about ten feet away and reach out and skin a banana and stuff it into his mouth twas a dirty man black faced and ragged and disgraceful of aspect yes the man was a ringer for the pictures of the fat weary willie in the funny papers i looked again and saw it was my general man de vega the great revolutionist mule rider and pickaxe importer when he saw me the general hesitated with his mouth filled with banana and his eyes the size of coconuts hist i says not a word or they ll put us off and make us walk veev la liberty i adds copperin the sentiment by shovin a banana into the source of it i was certain the general wouldn t recognize me the nefarious work of the tropics had left me lookin different there was half an inch of roan whiskers coverin me face and me costume was a pair of blue overalls and a red shirt how you come in the ship senor asked the general as soon as he could speak by the back door whist says i twas a glorious blow for liberty we struck i continues but we was overpowered by numbers let us accept our defeat like brave men and eat another banana were you in the cause of liberty fightin senor says the general sheddin tears on the cargo to the last says i twas i led the last desperate charge against the minions of the tyrant but it made them mad and we was forced to retreat twas i general procured the mule upon which you escaped could you give that ripe bunch a little boost this way general it s a bit out of my reach thanks say you so brave patriot said the general again weepin ah dios and i have not the means to reward your devotion barely did i my life bring away carrambos what a devil s animal was that mule senor like ships in one storm was i dashed about the skin on myself was ripped away with the thorns and vines upon the bark of a hundred trees did that beast of the infernal bump and cause outrage to the legs of mine in the night to port barrios i came i dispossess myself of that mountain of mule and hasten along the water shore i find a little boat to be tied i launch myself and row to the steamer i cannot see any mans on board so i climbed one rope which hang at the side i then myself hide in the bananas surely i say if the ship captains view me they shall throw me again to those guatemala those things are not good guatemala will shoot general de vega therefore i am hide and remain silent life itself is glorious liberty it is pretty good but so good as life i do not think three days as i said was the trip to new orleans the general man and me got to be cronies of the deepest dye bananas we ate until they were distasteful to the sight and an eyesore to the palate but to bananas alone was the bill of fare reduced at night i crawls out careful on the lower deck and gets a bucketful of fresh water that general de vega was a man inhabited by an engorgement of words and sentences he added to the monotony of the voyage by divestin himself of conversation he believed i was a revolutionist of his own party there bein as he told me a good many americans and other foreigners in its ranks twas a braggart and a conceited little gabbler it was though he considered himself a hero twas on himself he wasted all his regrets at the failing of his plot not a word did the little balloon have to say about the other misbehaving idiots that had been shot or run themselves to death in his revolution the second day out he was feelin pretty braggy and uppish for a stowed away conspirator that owed his existence to a mule and stolen bananas he was tellin me about the great railroad he had been buildin and he relates what he calls a comic incident about a fool irishman he inveigled from new orleans to sling a pick on his little morgue of a narrow gauge line twas sorrowful to hear the little dirty general tell the opprobrious story of how he put salt upon the tail of that reckless and silly bird clancy laugh he did hearty and long he shook with laughin the black faced rebel and outcast standing neck deep in bananas without friends or country ah senor he snickers to death you would have laughed at that drollest irish i say to him strong big mans is need very much in guatemala i will blows strike for your down pressed country he say that shall you do i tell him ah it was an irish so comic he sees one box break upon the wharf that contain for the guard a few gun he think there is gun in all the box but that is all pickaxe yes ah senor could you the face of that irish have seen when they set him to the work twas thus the ex boss of the employment bureau contributed to the tedium of the trip with merry jests and anecdote but now and then he would weep upon the bananas and make oration about the lost cause of liberty and the mule twas a pleasant sound when the steamer bumped against the pier in new orleans pretty soon we heard the pat a pat of hundreds of bare feet and the dago gang that unloads the fruit jumped on the deck and down into the hold me and the general worked a while at passing up the bunches and they thought we were part of the gang after about an hour we managed to slip off the steamer onto the wharf twas a great honor on the hands of an obscure clancy havin the entertainment of the representative of a great foreign filibustering power i first bought for the general and myself many long drinks and things to eat that were not bananas the general man trotted along at my side leaving all the arrangements to me i led him up to lafayette square and set him on a bench in the little park cigarettes i had bought for him and he humped himself down on the seat like a little fat contented hobo i look him over as he sets there and what i see pleases me brown by nature and instinct he is now brindled with dirt and dust praise to the mule his clothes is mostly strings and flaps yes the looks of the general man is agreeable to clancy i asks him delicate if by any chance he brought away anybody s money with him from guatemala he sighs and humps his shoulders against the bench not a cent all right maybe he tells me some of his friends in the tropic outfit will send him funds later the general was as clear a case of no visible means as i ever saw i told him not to move from the bench and then i went up to the corner of poydras and carondelet along there is o hara s beat in five minutes along comes o hara a big fine man red faced with shinin buttons swinging his club twould be a fine thing for guatemala to move into o hara s precinct twould be a fine bit of recreation for danny to suppress revolutions and uprisins once or twice a week with his club is workin yet danny says i walking up to him overtime says o hara looking over me suspicious want some of it fifty forty six is the celebrated city ordinance authorizing arrest conviction and imprisonment of persons that succeed in concealing their crimes from the police don t ye know jimmy clancy says i ye pink gilled monster so when o hara recognized me beneath the scandalous exterior bestowed upon me by the tropics i backed him into a doorway and told him what i wanted and why i wanted it all right jimmy says o hara go back and hold the bench i ll be along in ten minutes in that time o hara strolled through lafayette square and spied two weary willies disgracin one of the benches in ten minutes more j clancy and general de vega late candidate for the presidency of guatemala was in the station house the general is badly frightened and calls upon me to proclaim his distinguishments and rank the man says i to the police used to be a railroad man he s on the bum now tis a little bughouse he is on account of losin his job carrambos says the general fizzin like a little soda fountain you fought senor with my forces in my native country why do you say the lies you shall say i am the general de vega one soldier one caballero railroader says i again on the hog no good been livin for three days on stolen bananas look at him ain t that enough twenty five dollars or sixty days was what the recorder gave the general he didn t have a cent so he took the time they let me go as i knew they would for i had money to show and o hara spoke for me yes sixty days he got twas just so long as i slung a pick for the great country of kam guatemala clancy paused the bright starlight showed a reminiscent look of happy content on his seasoned features keogh leaned in his chair and gave his partner a slap on his thinly clad back that sounded like the crack of the surf on the sands tell em ye divil he chuckled how you got even with the tropical general in the way of agricultural maneuverings having no money concluded clancy with unction they set him to work his fine out with a gang from the parish prison clearing ursulines street around the corner was a saloon decorated genially with electric fans and cool merchandise i made that me headquarters and every fifteen minutes i d walk around and take a look at the little man filibusterin with a rake and shovel twas just such a hot broth of a day as this has been and i d call at him hey monseer and he d look at me black with the damp showin through his shirt in places fat strong mans says i to general de vega is needed in new orleans yes to carry on the good work carrambos erin go bragh xi the remnants of the code breakfast in coralio was at eleven therefore the people did not go to market early the little wooden market house stood on a patch of short trimmed grass under the vivid green foliage of a bread fruit tree thither one morning the venders leisurely convened bringing their wares with them a porch or platform six feet wide encircled the building shaded from the mid morning sun by the projecting grass thatched roof upon this platform the venders were wont to display their goods newly killed beef fish crabs fruit of the country cassava eggs dulces and high tottering stacks of native tortillas as large around as the sombrero of a spanish grandee but on this morning they whose stations lay on the seaward side of the market house instead of spreading their merchandise formed themselves into a softly jabbering and gesticulating group for there upon their space of the platform was sprawled asleep the unbeautiful figure of beelzebub blythe he lay upon a ragged strip of cocoa matting more than ever a fallen angel in appearance his suit of coarse flax soiled bursting at the seams crumpled into a thousand diversified wrinkles and creases inclosed him absurdly like the garb of some effigy that had been stuffed in sport and thrown there after indignity had been wrought upon it but firmly upon the high bridge of his nose reposed his gold rimmed glasses the surviving badge of his ancient glory the sun s rays reflecting quiveringly from the rippling sea upon his face and the voices of the market men woke beelzebub blythe he sat up blinking and leaned his back against the wall of the market drawing a blighted silk handkerchief from his pocket he assiduously rubbed and burnished his glasses and while doing this he became aware that his bedroom had been invaded and that polite brown and yellow men were beseeching him to vacate in favor of their market stuff if the senor would have the goodness a thousand pardons for bringing to him molestation but soon would come the compradores for the day s provisions surely they had ten thousand regrets at disturbing him in this manner they expanded to him the intimation that he must clear out and cease to clog the wheels of trade blythe stepped from the platform with the air of a prince leaving his canopied couch he never quite lost that air even at the lowest point of his fall it is clear that the college of good breeding does not necessarily maintain a chair of morals within its walls blythe shook out his wry clothing and moved slowly up the calle grande through the hot sand he moved without a destination in his mind the little town was languidly stirring to its daily life golden skinned babies tumbled over one another in the grass the sea breeze brought him appetite but nothing to satisfy it throughout coralio were its morning odors those from the heavily fragrant tropical flowers and from the bread baking in the outdoor ovens of clay and the pervading smoke of their fires where the smoke cleared the crystal air with some of the efficacy of faith seemed to remove the mountains almost to the sea bringing them so near that one might count the scarred glades on their wooded sides the light footed caribs were swiftly gliding to their tasks at the waterside already along the bosky trails from the banana groves files of horses were slowly moving concealed except for their nodding heads and plodding legs by the bunches of green golden fruit heaped upon their backs on doorsills sat women combing their long black hair and calling one to another across the narrow thoroughfares peace reigned in coralio arid and bald peace but still peace on that bright morning when nature seemed to be offering the lotus on the dawn s golden platter beelzebub blythe had reached rock bottom further descent seemed impossible that last night s slumber in a public place had done for him as long as he had had a roof to cover him there had remained unbridged the space that separates a gentleman from the beasts of the jungle and the fowls of the air but now he was little more than a whimpering oyster led to be devoured on the sands of a southern sea by the artful walrus circumstance and the implacable carpenter fate to blythe money was now but a memory he had drained his friends of all that their good fellowship had to offer then he had squeezed them to the last drop of their generosity and at last aaron like he had smitten the rock of their hardening bosoms for the scattering ignoble drops of charity itself he had exhausted his credit to the last real with the minute keenness of the shameless sponger he was aware of every source in coralio from which a glass of rum a meal or a piece of silver could be wheedled marshalling each such source in his mind he considered it with all the thoroughness and penetration that hunger and thirst lent him for the task all his optimism failed to thresh a grain of hope from the chaff of his postulations he had played out the game that one night in the open had shaken his nerves until then there had been left to him at least a few grounds upon which he could base his unblushing demands upon his neighbors stores now he must beg instead of borrowing the most brazen sophistry could not dignify by the name of loan the coin contemptuously flung to a beachcomber who slept on the bare boards of the public market but on this morning no beggar would have more thankfully received a charitable coin for the demon thirst had him by the throat the drunkard s matutinal thirst that requires to be slaked at each morning station on the road to tophet blythe walked slowly up the street keeping a watchful eye for any miracle that might drop manna upon him in his wilderness as he passed the popular eating house of madama vasquez madama s boarders were just sitting down to freshly baked bread aguacates pines and delicious coffee that sent forth odorous guarantee of its quality upon the breeze madama was serving she turned her shy stolid melancholy gaze for a moment out the window she saw blythe and her expression turned more shy and embarrassed beelzebub owed her twenty pesos he bowed as he had once bowed to less embarrassed dames to whom he owed nothing and passed on merchants and their clerks were throwing open the solid wooden doors of their shops polite but cool were the glances they cast upon blythe as he lounged tentatively by with the remains of his old jaunty air for they were his creditors almost without exception at the little fountain in the plaza he made an apology for a toilet with his wetted handkerchief across the open square filed the dolorous line of friends to the prisoners in the calaboza bearing the morning meal of the immured the food in their hands roused small longing in blythe it was drink that his soul craved or money to buy it in the streets he met many with whom he had been friends and equals and whose patience and liberality he had gradually exhausted willard geddie and paula cantered past him with the coolest of nods returning from their daily horseback ride along the old indian road keogh passed him at another corner whistling cheerfully and bearing a prize of newly laid eggs for the breakfast of himself and clancy the jovial scout of fortune was one of blythe s victims who had plunged his hand oftenest into his pocket to aid him but now it seemed that keogh too had fortified himself against further invasions his curt greeting and the ominous light in his full gray eye quickened the steps of beelzebub whom desperation had almost incited to attempt an additional loan three drinking shops the forlorn one next visited in succession in all of these his money his credit and his welcome had long since been spent but blythe felt that he would have fawned in the dust at the feet of an enemy that morning for one draught of aguardiente in two of the pulperias his courageous petition for drink was met with a refusal so polite that it stung worse than abuse the third establishment had acquired something of american methods and here he was seized bodily and cast out upon his hands and knees this physical indignity caused a singular change in the man as he picked himself up and walked away an expression of absolute relief came upon his features the specious and conciliatory smile that had been graven there was succeeded by a look of calm and sinister resolve beelzebub had been floundering in the sea of improbability holding by a slender life line to the respectable world that had cast him overboard he must have felt that with this ultimate shock the line had snapped and have experienced the welcome ease of the drowning swimmer who has ceased to struggle blythe walked to the next corner and stood there while he brushed the sand from his garments and repolished his glasses i ve got to do it oh i ve got to do it he told himself aloud if i had a quart of rum i believe i could stave it off yet for a little while but there s no more rum for beelzebub as they call me by the flames of tartarus if i m to sit at the right hand of satan somebody has got to pay the court expenses you ll have to pony up mr frank goodwin you re a good fellow but a gentleman must draw the line at being kicked into the gutter blackmail isn t a pretty word but it s the next station on the road i m travelling with purpose in his steps blythe now moved rapidly through the town by way of its landward environs he passed through the squalid quarters of the improvident negroes and on beyond the picturesque shacks of the poorer mestizos from many points along his course he could see through the umbrageous glades the house of frank goodwin on its wooded hill and as he crossed the little bridge over the lagoon he saw the old indian galvez scrubbing at the wooden slab that bore the name of miraflores beyond the lagoon the lands of goodwin began to slope gently upward a grassy road shaded by a munificent and diverse array of tropical flora wound from the edge of an outlying banana grove to the dwelling blythe took this road with long and purposeful strides goodwin was seated on his coolest gallery dictating letters to his secretary a sallow and capable native youth the household adhered to the american plan of breakfast and that meal had been a thing of the past for the better part of an hour the castaway walked to the steps and flourished a hand good morning blythe said goodwin looking up come in and have a chair anything i can do for you i want to speak to you in private goodwin nodded at his secretary who strolled out under a mango tree and lit a cigarette blythe took the chair that he had left vacant i want some money he began doggedly i m sorry said goodwin with equal directness but you can t have any you re drinking yourself to death blythe your friends have done all they could to help you to brace up you won t help yourself there s no use furnishing you with money to ruin yourself with any longer dear man said blythe tilting back his chair it isn t a question of social economy now it s past that i like you goodwin and i ve come to stick a knife between your ribs i was kicked out of espada s saloon this morning and society owes me reparation for my wounded feelings i didn t kick you out no but in a general way you represent society and in a particular way you represent my last chance i ve had to come down to it old man i tried to do it a month ago when losada s man was here turning things over but i couldn t do it then now it s different i want a thousand dollars goodwin and you ll have to give it to me only last week said goodwin with a smile a silver dollar was all you were asking for an evidence said blythe flippantly that i was still virtuous though under heavy pressure the wages of sin should be something higher than a peso worth forty eight cents let s talk business i am the villain in the third act and i must have my merited if only temporary triumph i saw you collar the late president s valiseful of boodle oh i know it s blackmail but i m liberal about the price i know i m a cheap villain one of the regular sawmill drama kind but you re one of my particular friends and i don t want to stick you hard suppose you go into the details suggested goodwin calmly arranging his letters on the table all right said beelzebub i like the way you take it i despise histrionics so you will please prepare yourself for the facts without any red fire calcium or grace notes on the saxophone on the night that his fly by night excellency arrived in town i was very drunk you will excuse the pride with which i state that fact but it was quite a feat for me to attain that desirable state somebody had left a cot out under the orange trees in the yard of madama ortiz s hotel i stepped over the wall laid down upon it and fell asleep i was awakened by an orange that dropped from the tree upon my nose and i laid there for a while cursing sir isaac newton or whoever it was that invented gravitation for not confining his theory to apples and then along came mr miraflores and his true love with the treasury in a valise and went into the hotel next you hove in sight and held a pow wow with the tonsorial artist who insisted upon talking shop after hours i tried to slumber again but once more my rest was disturbed this time by the noise of the popgun that went off upstairs then that valise came crashing down into an orange tree just above my head and i arose from my couch not knowing when it might begin to rain saratoga trunks when the army and the constabulary began to arrive with their medals and decorations hastily pinned to their pajamas and their snickersnees drawn i crawled into the welcome shadow of a banana plant i remained there for an hour by which time the excitement and the people had cleared away and then my dear goodwin excuse me i saw you sneak back and pluck that ripe and juicy valise from the orange tree i followed you and saw you take it to your own house a hundred thousand dollar crop from one orange tree in a season about breaks the record of the fruit growing industry being a gentleman at that time of course i never mentioned the incident to any one but this morning i was kicked out of a saloon my code of honor is all out at the elbows and i d sell my mother s prayer book for three fingers of aguardiente i m not putting on the screws hard it ought to be worth a thousand to you for me to have slept on that cot through the whole business without waking up and seeing anything goodwin opened two more letters and made memoranda in pencil on them then he called manuel to his secretary who came spryly the ariel when does she sail asked goodwin senor answered the youth at three this afternoon she drops down coast to punta soledad to complete her cargo of fruit from there she sails for new orleans without delay bueno said goodwin these letters may wait yet awhile the secretary returned to his cigarette under the mango tree in round numbers said goodwin facing blythe squarely how much money do you owe in this town not including the sums you have borrowed from me five hundred at a rough guess answered blythe lightly go somewhere in the town and draw up a schedule of your debts said goodwin come back here in two hours and i will send manuel with the money to pay them i will also have a decent outfit of clothing ready for you you will sail on the ariel at three manuel will accompany you as far as the deck of the steamer there he will hand you one thousand dollars in cash i suppose that we needn t discuss what you will be expected to do in return oh i understand piped blythe cheerily i was asleep all the time on the cot under madama ortiz s orange trees and i shake off the dust of coralio forever i ll play fair no more of the lotus for me your proposition is k youre a good fellow goodwin and i let you off light i ll agree to everything but in the meantime i ve a devil of a thirst on old man not a centavo said goodwin firmly until you are on board the ariel you would be drunk in thirty minutes if you had money now but he noticed the blood streaked eyeballs the relaxed form and the shaking hands of beelzebub and he stepped into the dining room through the low window and brought out a glass and a decanter of brandy take a bracer anyway before you go he proposed even as a man to the friend whom he entertains beelzebub blythe s eyes glistened at the sight of the solace for which his soul burned today for the first time his poisoned nerves had been denied their steadying dose and their retort was a mounting torment he grasped the decanter and rattled its crystal mouth against the glass in his trembling hand he flushed the glass and then stood erect holding it aloft for an instant for one fleeting moment he held his head above the drowning waves of his abyss he nodded easily at goodwin raised his brimming glass and murmured a health that men had used in his ancient paradise lost and then so suddenly that he spilled the brandy over his hand he set down his glass untasted in two hours his dry lips muttered to goodwin as he marched down the steps and turned his face toward the town in the edge of the cool banana grove beelzebub halted and snapped the tongue of his belt buckle into another hole i couldn t do it he explained feverishly to the waving banana fronds i wanted to but i couldn t a gentleman can t drink with the man that he blackmails xii shoes john de graffenreid atwood ate of the lotus root stem and flower the tropics gobbled him up he plunged enthusiastically into his work which was to try to forget rosine now they who dine on the lotus rarely consume it plain there is a sauce au diable that goes with it and the distillers are the chefs who prepare it and on johnny s menu card it read brandy with a bottle between them he and billy keogh would sit on the porch of the little consulate at night and roar out great indecorous songs until the natives slipping hastily past would shrug a shoulder and mutter things to themselves about the americanos diablos one day johnny s mozo brought the mail and dumped it on the table johnny leaned from his hammock and fingered the four or five letters dejectedly keogh was sitting on the edge of the table chopping lazily with a paper knife at the legs of a centipede that was crawling among the stationery johnny was in that phase of lotus eating when all the world tastes bitter in one s mouth same old thing he complained fool people writing for information about the country they want to know all about raising fruit and how to make a fortune without work half of em don t even send stamps for a reply they think a consul hasn t anything to do but write letters slit those envelopes for me old man and see what they want i m feeling too rocky to move keogh acclimated beyond all possibility of ill humor drew his chair to the table with smiling compliance on his rose pink countenance and began to slit open the letters four of them were from citizens in various parts of the united states who seemed to regard the consul at coralio as a cyclopedia of information they asked long lists of questions numerically arranged about the climate products possibilities laws business chances and statistics of the country in which the consul had the honor of representing his own government write em please billy said that inert official just a line referring them to the latest consular report tell em the state department will be delighted to furnish the literary gems sign my name don t let your pen scratch billy it ll keep me awake don t snore said keogh amiably and i ll do your work for you you need a corps of assistants anyhow don t see how you ever get out a report wake up a minute here s one more letter it s from your own town too dalesburg that so murmured johnny showing a mild and obligatory interest what s it about postmaster writes explained keogh says a citizen of the town wants some facts and advice from you says the citizen has an idea in his head of coming down where you are and opening a shoe store wants to know if you think the business would pay says he s heard of the boom along this coast and wants to get in on the ground floor in spite of the heat and his bad temper johnny s hammock swayed with his laughter keogh laughed too and the pet monkey on the top shelf of the bookcase chattered in shrill sympathy with the ironical reception of the letter from dalesburg great bunions exclaimed the consul shoe store what ll they ask about next i wonder overcoat factory i reckon say billy of our citizens how many do you suppose ever had on a pair of shoes keogh reflected judicially let s see there s you and me and not me said johnny promptly and incorrectly holding up a foot encased in a disreputable deerskin zapato i haven t been a victim to shoes in months but you ve got em though went on keogh and there s goodwin and blanchard and geddie and old lutz and doc gregg and that italian that s agent for the banana company and there s old delgado no he wears sandals and oh yes there s madama ortiz what kapes the hotel she had on a pair of red kid slippers at the baile the other night and miss pasa her daughter that went to school in the states she brought back some civilized notions in the way of footgear and there s the comandante s sister that dresses up her feet on feast days and mrs geddie who wears a two with a castilian instep and that s about all the ladies let s see don t some of the soldiers at the cuartel no that s so they re allowed shoes only when on the march in barracks they turn their little toeses out to grass bout right agreed the consul not over twenty out of the three thousand ever felt leather on their walking arrangements oh yes coralio is just the town for an enterprising shoe store that doesn t want to part with its goods wonder if old patterson is trying to jolly me he always was full of things he called jokes write him a letter billy i ll dictate it we ll jolly him back a few keogh dipped his pen and wrote at johnny s dictation with many pauses filled in with smoke and sundry travellings of the bottle and glasses the following reply to the dalesburg communication was perpetrated mr obadiah patterson dalesburg ala dear sir in reply to your favor of july d i have the honor to inform you that according to my opinion there is no place on the habitable globe that presents to the eye stronger evidence of the need of a first class shoe store than does the town of coralio there are inhabitants in the place and not a single shoe store the situation speaks for itself this coast is rapidly becoming the goal of enterprising business men but the shoe business is one that has been sadly overlooked or neglected in fact there are a considerable number of our citizens actually without shoes at present besides the want above mentioned there is also a crying need for a brewery a college of higher mathematics a coal yard and a clean and intellectual punch and judy show i have the honor to be your obt servant john de graffenreid atwood u s consul at coralio p s hello uncle obadiah how s the old burg racking along what would the government do without you and me look out for a green headed parrot and a bunch of bananas soon from your old friend johnny i throw in that postscript explained the consul so uncle obadiah won t take offense at the official tone of the letter now billy you get that correspondence fixed up and send pancho to the post office with it the ariadne takes the mail out tomorrow if they make up that load of fruit today the night programme in coralio never varied the recreations of the people were soporific and flat they wandered about barefoot and aimless speaking lowly and smoking cigar or cigarette looking down on the dimly lighted ways one seemed to see a threading maze of brunette ghosts tangled with a procession of insane fireflies in some houses the thrumming of lugubrious guitars added to the depression of the triste night giant tree frogs rattled in the foliage as loudly as the end man s bones in a minstrel troupe by nine o clock the streets were almost deserted not at the consulate was there often a change of bill keogh would come there nightly for coralio s one cool place was the little porch of that official residence the brandy would be kept moving and before midnight sentiment would begin to stir in the heart of the self exiled consul then he would relate to keogh the story of his ended romance each night keogh would listen patiently to the tale and be ready with untiring sympathy but don t you think for a minute thus johnny would always conclude his woeful narrative that i m grieving about that girl billy i ve forgotten her she never enters my mind if she were to enter that door right now my pulse wouldn t gain a beat that s all over long ago don t i know it keogh would answer of course you ve forgotten her proper thing to do wasn t quite k of her to listen to the knocks that er dink pawson kept giving you pink dawson a word of contempt would be in johnny s tones poor white trash that s what he was had five hundred acres of farming land though and that counted maybe i ll have a chance to get back at him some day the dawsons weren t anybody everybody in alabama knows the atwoods say billy did you know my mother was a de graffenreid why no keogh would say is that so he had heard it some three hundred times fact the de graffenreids of hancock county but i never think of that girl any more do i billy not for a minute my boy would be the last sounds heard by the conqueror of cupid at this point johnny would fall into a gentle slumber and keogh would saunter out to his own shack under the calabash tree at the edge of the plaza in a day or two the letter from the dalesburg postmaster and its answer had been forgotten by the coralio exiles but on the th day of july the fruit of the reply appeared upon the tree of events the andador a fruit steamer that visited coralio regularly drew into the offing and anchored the beach was lined with spectators while the quarantine doctor and the custom house crew rowed out to attend to their duties an hour later billy keogh lounged into the consulate clean and cool in his linen clothes and grinning like a pleased shark guess what he said to johnny lounging in his hammock too hot to guess said johnny lazily your shoe store man s come said keogh rolling the sweet morsel on his tongue with a stock of goods big enough to supply the continent as far down as tierra del fuego they re carting his cases over to the custom house now six barges full they brought ashore and have paddled back for the rest oh ye saints in glory won t there be regalements in the air when he gets onto the joke and has an interview with mr consul it ll be worth nine years in the tropics just to witness that one joyful moment keogh loved to take his mirth easily he selected a clean place on the matting and lay upon the floor the walls shook with his enjoyment johnny turned half over and blinked didn t tell me he said that anybody was fool enough to take that letter seriously four thousand dollar stock of goods gasped keogh in ecstasy talk about coals to newcastle why didn t he take a ship load of palm leaf fans to spitzenbergen while he was about it saw the old codger on the beach you ought to have been there when he put on his specs and squinted at the five hundred or so barefooted citizens standing around are you telling the truth billy asked the consul weakly am i you ought to see the buncoed gentleman s daughter he brought along looks she makes the brick dust senoritas here look like tar babies go on said johnny if you can stop that asinine giggling i hate to see a grown man make a laughing hyena of himself name is hemstetter went on keogh he s a hello what s the matter now johnny s moccasined feet struck the floor with a thud as he wriggled out of his hammock get up you idiot he said sternly or i ll brain you with this inkstand that s rosine and her father gad what a drivelling idiot old patterson is get up here billy keogh and help me what the devil are we going to do has all the world gone crazy keogh rose and dusted himself he managed to regain a decorous demeanor situation has got to be met johnny he said with some success at seriousness i didn t think about its being your girl until you spoke first thing to do is to get them comfortable quarters you go down and face the music and i ll trot out to goodwin s and see if mrs goodwin won t take them in they ve got the decentest house in town bless you billy said the consul i knew you wouldn t desert me the world s bound to come to an end but maybe we can stave it off for a day or two keogh hoisted his umbrella and set out for goodwin s house johnny put on his coat and hat he picked up the brandy bottle but set it down again without drinking and marched bravely down to the beach in the shade of the custom house walls he found mr hemstetter and rosine surrounded by a mass of gaping citizens the customs officers were ducking and scraping while the captain of the andador interpreted the business of the new arrivals rosine looked healthy and very much alive she was gazing at the strange scenes around her with amused interest there was a faint blush upon her round cheek as she greeted her old admirer mr hemstetter shook hands with johnny in a very friendly way he was an oldish impractical man one of that numerous class of erratic business men who are forever dissatisfied and seeking a change i am very glad to see you john may i call you john he said let me thank you for your prompt answer to our postmaster s letter of inquiry he volunteered to write to you on my behalf i was looking about for something different in the way of a business in which the profits would be greater i had noticed in the papers that this coast was receiving much attention from investors i am extremely grateful for your advice to come i sold out everything that i possess and invested the proceeds in as fine a stock of shoes as could be bought in the north you have a picturesque town here john i hope business will be as good as your letter justifies me in expecting johnny s agony was abbreviated by the arrival of keogh who hurried up with the news that mrs goodwin would be much pleased to place rooms at the disposal of mr hemstetter and his daughter so there mr hemstetter and rosine were at once conducted and left to recuperate from the fatigue of the voyage while johnny went down to see that the cases of shoes were safely stored in the customs warehouse pending their examination by the officials keogh grinning like a shark skirmished about to find goodwin to instruct him not to expose to mr hemstetter the true state of coralio as a shoe market until johnny had been given a chance to redeem the situation if such a thing were possible that night the consul and keogh held a desperate consultation on the breezy porch of the consulate send em back home began keogh reading johnny s thoughts i would said johnny after a little silence but i ve been lying to you billy all right about that said keogh affably i ve told you hundreds of times said johnny slowly that i had forgotten that girl haven t i about three hundred and seventy five admitted the monument of patience i lied repeated the consul every time i never forgot her for one moment i was an obstinate ass for running away just because she said no once and i was too proud a fool to go back i talked with rosine a few minutes this evening up at goodwin s i found out one thing you remember that farmer fellow who was always after her dink pawson asked keogh pink dawson well he wasn t a hill of beans to her she says she didn t believe a word of the things be told her about me but i m sewed up now billy that tomfool letter we sent ruined whatever chance i had left she ll despise me when she finds out that her old father has been made the victim of a joke that a decent schoolboy wouldn t have been guilty of shoes why he couldn t sell twenty pairs of shoes in coralio if he kept store here for twenty years you put a pair of shoes on one of these caribs or spanish brown boys and what d he do stand on his head and squeal until he d kicked em off none of em ever wore shoes and they never will if i send em back home i ll have to tell the whole story and what ll she think of me i want that girl worse than ever billy and now when she s in reach i ve lost her forever because i tried to be funny when the thermometer was at keep cheerful said the optimistic keogh and let em open the store i ve been busy myself this afternoon we can stir up a temporary boom in foot gear anyhow i ll buy six pairs when the doors open i ve been around and seen all the fellows and explained the catastrophe they ll all buy shoes like they was centipedes frank goodwin will take cases of em the geddies want about eleven pairs between em clancy is going to invest the savings of weeks and even old doc gregg wants three pairs of alligator hide slippers if they ve got any tens blanchard got a look at miss hemstetter and as he s a frenchman no less than a dozen pairs will do for him a dozen customers said johnny for a stock of shoes it won t work there s a big problem here to figure out you go home billy and leave me alone i ve got to work at it all by myself take that bottle of three star along with you no sir not another ounce of booze for the united states consul i ll sit here tonight and pull out the think stop if there s a soft place on this proposition anywhere i ll land on it if there isn t there ll be another wreck to the credit of the gorgeous tropics keogh left feeling that he could be of no use johnny laid a handful of cigars on a table and stretched himself in a steamer chair when the sudden daylight broke silvering the harbor ripples he was still sitting there then he got up whistling a little tune and took his bath at nine o clock he walked down to the dingy little cable office and hung for half an hour over a blank the result of his application was the following message which he signed and had transmitted at a cost of to pinkney dawson dalesburg ala draft for comes to you next mail ship me immediately pounds stiff dry cockleburrs new use here in arts market price twenty cents pound further orders likely rush xiii ships within a week a suitable building had been secured in the calle grande and mr hemstetter s stock of shoes arranged upon their shelves the rent of the store was moderate and the stock made a fine showing of neat white boxes attractively displayed johnny s friends stood by him loyally on the first day keogh strolled into the store in a casual kind of way about once every hour and bought shoes after he had purchased a pair each of extension soles congress gaiters button kids low quartered calfs dancing pumps rubber boots tans of various hues tennis shoes and flowered slippers he sought out johnny to be prompted as to the names of other kinds that he might inquire for the other english speaking residents also played their parts nobly by buying often and liberally keogh was grand marshal and made them distribute their patronage thus keeping up a fair run of custom for several days mr hemstetter was gratified by the amount of business done thus far but expressed surprise that the natives were so backward with their custom oh they re awfully shy explained johnny as he wiped his forehead nervously they ll get the habit pretty soon they ll come with a rush when they do come one afternoon keogh dropped into the consul s office chewing an unlighted cigar thoughtfully got anything up your sleeve he inquired of johnny if you have it s about time to show it if you can borrow some gent s hat in the audience and make a lot of customers for an idle stock of shoes come out of it you d better spiel the boys have all laid in enough footwear to last em ten years and there s nothing doing in the shoe store but dolcy far nienty i just came by there your venerable victim was standing in the door gazing through his specs at the bare toes passing by his emporium the natives here have got the true artistic temperament me and clancy took eighteen tintypes this morning in two hours there s been but one pair of shoes sold all day blanchard went in and bought a pair of furlined house slippers because he thought he saw miss hemstetter go into the store i saw him throw the slippers into the lagoon afterwards there s a mobile fruit steamer coming in tomorrow or next day said johnny we can t do anything until then what are you going to do try to create a demand political economy isn t your strong point said the consul impudently you can t create a demand but you can create a necessity for a demand that s what i am going to do two weeks after the consul sent his cable a fruit steamer brought him a huge mysterious brown bale of some unknown commodity johnny s influence with the custom house people was sufficiently strong for him to get the goods turned over to him without the usual inspection he had the bale taken to the consulate and snugly stowed in the back room that night he ripped open a corner of it and took out a handful of the cockleburrs he examined them with the care with which a warrior examines his arms before he goes forth to battle for his lady love and life the burrs were the ripe august product as hard as filberts and bristling with spines as tough and sharp as needles johnny whistled softly a little tune and went out to find billy keogh later in the night when coralio was steeped in slumber he and billy went forth into the deserted streets with their coats bulging like balloons all up and down the calle grande they went sowing the sharp burrs carefully in the sand along the narrow sidewalks in every foot of grass between the silent houses and then they took the side streets and byways missing none no place where the foot of man woman or child might fall was slighted many trips they made to and from the prickly hoard and then nearly at the dawn they laid themselves down to rest calmly as great generals do after planning a victory according to the revised tactics and slept knowing that they had sowed with the accuracy of satan sowing tares and the perseverance of paul planting with the rising sun came the purveyors of fruits and meats and arranged their wares in and around the little market house at one end of the town near the seashore the market house stood and the sowing of the burrs had not been carried that far the dealers waited long past the hour when their sales usually began none came to buy que hay they began to exclaim one to another at their accustomed time from every dobe and palm hut and grass thatched shack and dim patio glided women black women brown women lemon colored women women dun and yellow and tawny they were the marketers starting to purchase the family supply of cassava plantains meat fowls and tortillas decollete they were and bare armed and bare footed with a single skirt reaching below the knee stolid and ox eyed they stepped from their doorways into the narrow paths or upon the soft grass of the streets the first to emerge uttered ambiguous squeals and raised one foot quickly another step and they sat down with shrill cries of alarm to pick at the new and painful insects that had stung them upon the feet que picadores diablos they screeched to one another across the narrow ways some tried the grass instead of the paths but there they were also stung and bitten by the strange little prickly balls they plumped down in the grass and added their lamentations to those of their sisters in the sandy paths all through the town was heard the plaint of the feminine jabber the venders in the market still wondered why no customers came then men lords of the earth came forth they too began to hop to dance to limp and to curse they stood stranded and foolish or stopped to pluck at the scourge that attacked their feet and ankles some loudly proclaimed the pest to be poisonous spiders of an unknown species and then the children ran out for their morning romp and now to the uproar was added the howls of limping infants and cockleburred childhood every minute the advancing day brought forth fresh victims dona maria castillas y buenventura de las casas stepped from her honored doorway as was her daily custom to procure fresh bread from the panaderia across the street she was clad in a skirt of flowered yellow satin a chemise of ruffled linen and wore a purple mantilla from the looms of spain her lemon tinted feet alas were bare her progress was majestic for were not her ancestors hidalgos of aragon three steps she made across the velvety grass and set her aristocratic sole upon a bunch of johnny s burrs dona maria castillas y buenventura de las casas emitted a yowl even as a wild cat turning about she fell upon hands and knees and crawled ay like a beast of the field she crawled back to her honorable door sill don senor ildefonso federico valdazar juez de la paz weighing twenty stone attempted to convey his bulk to the pulperia at the corner of the plaza in order to assuage his matutinal thirst the first plunge of his unshod foot into the cool grass struck a concealed mine don ildefonso fell like a crumpled cathedral crying out that he had been fatally bitten by a deadly scorpion everywhere were the shoeless citizens hopping stumbling limping and picking from their feet the venomous insects that had come in a single night to harass them the first to perceive the remedy was esteban delgado the barber a man of travel and education sitting upon a stone he plucked burrs from his toes and made oration behold my friends these bugs of the devil i know them well they soar through the skies in swarms like pigeons these are dead ones that fell during the night in yucatan i have seen them as large as oranges yes there they hiss like serpents and have wings like bats it is the shoes the shoes that one needs zapatos zapatos para mi esteban hobbled to mr hemstetter s store and bought shoes coming out he swaggered down the street with impunity reviling loudly the bugs of the devil the suffering ones sat up or stood upon one foot and beheld the immune barber men women and children took up the cry zapatos zapatos the necessity for the demand had been created the demand followed that day mr hemstetter sold three hundred pairs of shoes it is really surprising he said to johnny who came up in the evening to help him straighten out the stock how trade is picking up yesterday i made but three sales i told you they d whoop things up when they got started said the consul i think i shall order a dozen more cases of goods to keep the stock up said mr hemstetter beaming through his spectacles i wouldn t send in any orders yet advised johnny wait till you see how the trade holds up each night johnny and keogh sowed the crop that grew dollars by day at the end of ten days two thirds of the stock of shoes had been sold and the stock of cockleburrs was exhausted johnny cabled to pink dawson for another pounds paying twenty cents per pound as before mr hemstetter carefully made up an order for worth of shoes from northern firms johnny hung about the store until this order was ready for the mail and succeeded in destroying it before it reached the postoffice that night he took rosine under the mango tree by godwin s porch and confessed everything she looked him in the eye and said you are a very wicked man father and i will go back home you say it was a joke i think it is a very serious matter but at the end of half an hour s argument the conversation had been turned upon a different subject the two were considering the respective merits of pale blue and pink wall paper with which the old colonial mansion of the atwoods in dalesburg was to be decorated after the wedding on the next morning johnny confessed to mr hemstetter the shoe merchant put on his spectacles and said through them you strike me as being a most extraordinary young scamp if i had not managed this enterprise with good business judgment my entire stock of goods might have been a complete loss now how do you propose to dispose of the rest of it when the second invoice of cockleburrs arrived johnny loaded them and the remainder of the shoes into schooner and sailed down the coast to alazan there in the same dark and diabolical manner he repeated his success and came back with a bag of money and not so much as a shoestring and then he besought his great uncle of the waving goatee and starred vest to accept his resignation for the lotus no longer lured him he hankered for the spinach and cress of dalesburg the services of mr william terence keogh as acting consul pro term were suggested and accepted and johnny sailed with the hemstetters back to his native shores keogh slipped into the sinecure of the american consulship with the ease that never left him even in such high places the tintype establishment was soon to become a thing of the past although its deadly work along the peaceful and helpless spanish main was never effaced the restless partners were about to be off again scouting ahead of the slow ranks of fortune but now they would take different ways there were rumors of a promising uprising in peru and thither the martial clancy would turn his adventurous steps as for keogh he was figuring in his mind and on quires of government letter heads a scheme that dwarfed the art of misrepresenting the human countenance upon tin what suits me keogh used to say in the way of a business proposition is something diversified that looks like a longer shot than it is something in the way of a genteel graft that isn t worked enough for the correspondence schools to be teaching it by mail i take the long end but i like to have at least as good a chance to win as a man learning to play poker on an ocean steamer or running for governor of texas on the republican ticket and when i cash in my winnings i don t want to find any widows and orphans chips in my stack the grass grown globe was the green table on which keogh gambled the games he played were of his own invention he was no grubber after the diffident dollar nor did he care to follow it with horn and hounds rather he loved to coax it with egregious and brilliant flies from its habitat in the waters of strange streams yet keogh was a business man and his schemes in spite of their singularity were as solidly set as the plans of a building contractor in arthur s time sir william keogh would have been a knight of the round table in these modern days he rides abroad seeking the graft instead of the grail three days after johnny s departure two small schooners appeared off coralio after some delay a boat put off from one of them and brought a sunburned young man ashore this young man had a shrewd and calculating eye and he gazed with amazement at the strange things that he saw he found on the beach some one who directed him to the consul s office and thither he made his way at a nervous gait keogh was sprawled in the official chair drawing caricatures of his uncle s head on an official pad of paper he looked up at his visitor where s johnny atwood inquired the sunburned young man in a business tone gone said keogh working carefully at uncle sam s necktie that s just like him remarked the nut brown one leaning against the table he always was a fellow to gallivant around instead of tending to business will he be in soon don t think so said keogh after a fair amount of deliberation i s pose he s out at some of his tomfoolery conjectured the visitor in a tone of virtuous conviction johnny never would stick to anything long enough to succeed i wonder how he manages to run his business here and never be round to look after it i m looking after the business just now admitted the pro term consul are you then say where s the factory what factory asked keogh with a mildly polite interest why the factory where they use them cockleburrs lord knows what they use em for anyway i ve got the basements of both them ships out there loaded with em i ll give you a bargain in this lot i ve had every man woman and child around dalesburg that wasn t busy pickin em for a month i hired these ships to bring em over everybody thought i was crazy now you can have this lot for fifteen cents a pound delivered on land and if you want more i guess old alabam can come up to the demand johnny told me when he left home that if he struck anything down here that there was any money in he d let me in on it shall i drive the ships in and hitch a look of supreme almost incredulous delight dawned in keogh s ruddy countenance he dropped his pencil his eyes turned upon the sunburned young man with joy in them mingled with fear lest his ecstasy should prove a dream for god s sake tell me said keogh earnestly are you dink pawson my name is pinkney dawson said the cornerer of the cockleburr market billy keogh slid rapturously and gently from his chair to his favorite strip of matting on the floor there were not many sounds in coralio on that sultry afternoon among those that were may be mentioned a noise of enraptured and unrighteous laughter from a prostrate irish american while a sunburned young man with a shrewd eye looked on him with wonder and amazement also the tramp tramp tramp of many well shod feet in the streets outside also the lonesome wash of the waves that beat along the historic shores of the spanish main xiv masters of arts a two inch stub of a blue pencil was the wand with which keogh performed the preliminary acts of his magic so with this he covered paper with diagrams and figures while he waited for the united states of america to send down to coralio a successor to atwood resigned the new scheme that his mind had conceived his stout heart indorsed and his blue pencil corroborated was laid around the characteristics and human frailties of the new president ofanchuria these characteristics and the situation out of which keogh hoped to wrest a golden tribute deserve chronicling contributive to the clear order of events president losada many called him dictator was a man whose genius would have made him conspicuous even among anglo saxons had not that genius been intermixed with other traits that were petty and subversive he had some of the lofty patriotism of washington the man he most admired the force of napoleon and much of the wisdom of the sages these characteristics might have justified him the assumption of the title of the illustrious liberator had they not been accompanied by a stupendous and amazing vanity that kept him in the less worthy ranks of the dictators yet he did his country great service with a mighty grasp he shook it nearly free from the shackles of ignorance and sloth and the vermin that fed upon it and all but made it a power in the council of nations he established schools and hospitals built roads bridges railroads and palaces and bestowed generous subsidies upon the arts and sciences he was the absolute despot and the idol of his people the wealth of the country poured into his hands other presidents had been rapacious without reason losada amassed enormous wealth but his people had their share of the benefits the joint in his armor was his insatiate passion for monuments and tokens commemorating his glory in every town he caused to be erected statues of himself bearing legends in praise of his greatness in the walls of every public edifice tablets were fixed reciting his splendor and the gratitude of his subjects his statuettes and portraits were scattered throughout the land in every house and hut one of the sycophants in his court painted him as st john with a halo and a train of attendants in full uniform losada saw nothing incongruous in this picture and had it hung in a church in the capital he ordered from a french sculptor a marble group including himself with napoleon alexander the great and one or two others whom he deemed worthy of the honor he ransacked europe for decorations employing policy money and intrigue to cajole the orders he coveted from kings and rulers on state occasions his breast was covered from shoulder to shoulder with crosses stars golden roses medals and ribbons it was said that the man who could contrive for him a new decoration or invent some new method of extolling his greatness might plunge a hand deep into the treasury this was the man upon whom billy keogh had his eye the gentle buccaneer had observed the rain of favors that fell upon those who ministered to the president s vanities and he did not deem it his duty to hoist his umbrella against the scattering drops of liquid fortune in a few weeks the new consul arrived releasing keogh from his temporary duties he was a young man fresh from college who lived for botany alone the consulate at coralio gave him the opportunity to study tropical flora he wore smoked glasses and carried a green umbrella he filled the cool back porch of the consulate with plants and specimens so that space for a bottle and chair was not to be found keogh gazed on him sadly but without rancor and began to pack his gripsack for his new plot against stagnation along the spanish main required of him a voyage overseas soon came the karlsefin again she of the trampish habits gleaning a cargo of coconuts for a speculative descent upon the new york market keogh was booked for a passage on the return trip yes i m going to new york he explained to the group of his countrymen that had gathered on the beach to see him off but i ll be back before you miss me i ve undertaken the art education of this piebald country and i m not the man to desert it while it s in the early throes of tintypes with this mysterious declaration of his intentions keogh boarded the karlsefin ten days later shivering with the collar of his thin coat turned high he burst into the studio of carolus white at the top of a tall building in tenth street new york city carolus white was smoking a cigarette and frying sausages over an oil stove he was only twenty three and had noble theories about art billy knight exclaimed white extending the hand that was not busy with the frying pan from what part of the uncivilized world i wonder hello carry said keogh dragging forward a stool and holding his fingers close to the stove i m glad i found you so soon i ve been looking for you all day in the directories and art galleries the free lunch man on the corner told me where you were quick i was sure you d be painting pictures yet keogh glanced about the studio with the shrewd eye of a connoisseur in business yes you can do it he declared with many gentle nods of his head that big one in the corner with the angels and greeh clouds and band wagon is just the sort of thing we want what would you call that carry scene from coney island ain t it that said white i had intended to call the translation of elijah but you may be nearer right than i am name doesn t matter said keogh largely it s the frame and the varieties of paint that does the trick now i can tell you in a minute what i want i ve come on a little voyage of two thousand miles to take you in with me on a scheme i thought of you as soon as the scheme showed itself to me how would you like to go back with me and paint a picture ninety days for the trip and five thousand dollars for the job cereal food or hair tonic posters asked white it isn t an ad what kind of a picture is it to be it s a long story said keogh go ahead with it if you don t mind while you talk i ll just keep my eye on these sausages let em get one shade deeper than a vandyke brown and you spoil em keogh explained his project they were to return to coralio where white was to pose as a distinguished american portrait painter who was touring in the tropics as a relaxation from his arduous and remunerative professional labors it was not an unreasonable hope even to those who trod in the beaten paths of business that an artist with so much prestige might secure a commission to perpetuate upon canvas the lineaments of the president and secure a share of the pesos that were raining upon the caterers to his weaknesses keogh had set his price at ten thousand dollars artists had been paid more for portraits he and white were to share the expenses of the trip and divide the possible profits thus he laid the scheme before white whom he had known in the west before one declared for art and the other became a bedouin before long the two machinators abandoned the rigor of the bare studio for a snug corner of a cafe there they sat far into the night with old envelopes and keogh s stub of blue pencil between them at twelve o clock white doubled up in his chair with his chin on his fist and shut his eyes at the unbeautiful wall paper i ll go you billy he said in the quiet tones of decision i ve got two or three hundred saved up for sausages and rent and i ll take the chance with you five thousand it will give me two years in paris and one in italy i ll begin to pack tomorrow you ll begin in ten minutes said keogh it s to morrow now the karlsefin starts back at four p m come on to your painting shop and i ll help you for five months in the year coralio is the newport of anchuria then only does the town possess life from november to march it is practically the seat of government the president with his official family sojourns there and society follows him the pleasure loving people make the season one long holiday of amusement and rejoicing fiestas balls games sea bathing processions and small theatres contribute to their enjoyment the famous swiss band from the capital plays in the little plaza every evening while the fourteen carriages and vehicles in the town circle in funereal but complacent procession indians from the interior mountains looking like pre historic stone idols come down to peddle their handiwork in the streets the people throng the narrow ways a chattering happy careless stream of buoyant humanity preposterous children rigged out with the shortest of ballet skirts and gilt wings howl underfoot among the effervescent crowds especially is the arrival of the presidential party at the opening of the season attended with pomp show and patriotic demonstrations of enthusiasm and delight when keogh and white reached their destination on the return trip of the karlsefin the gay winter season was well begun as they stepped upon the beach they could hear the band playing in the plaza the village maidens with fireflies already fixed in their dark locks were gliding barefoot and coy eyed along the paths dandies in white linen swinging their canes were beginning their seductive strolls the air was full of human essence of artificial enticement of coquetry indolence pleasure the man made sense of existence the first two or three days after their arrival were spent in preliminaries keogh escorted the artist about town introducing him to the little circle of english speaking residents and pulling whatever wires he could to effect the spreading of white s fame as a painter and then keogh planned a

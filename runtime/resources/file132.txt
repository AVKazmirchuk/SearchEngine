the victoria sped away with the artist keogh walked up and down puffing great clouds of smoke from his pipe and waited in an hour the victoria swept again to the door of the hotel deposited white and vanished the artist dashed up the stairs three at a step keogh stopped smoking and became a silent interrogation point landed exclaimed white with his boyish face flushed with elation billy you are a wonder he wants a picture i ll tell you all about it by heavens that dictator chap is a corker he s a dictator clear down to his finger ends he s a kind of combination of julius caesar lucifer and chauncey depew done in sepia polite and grim that s his way the room i saw him in was about ten acres big and looked like a mississippi steamboat with its gilding and mirrors and white paint he talks english better than i can ever hope to the matter of the price came up i mentioned ten thousand i expected him to call the guard and have me taken out and shot he didn t move an eyelash he just waved one of his chestnut hands in a careless way and said whatever you say i am to go back tomorrow and discuss with him the details of the picture keogh hung his head self abasement was easy to read in his downcast countenance i m failing carry he said sorrowfully i m not fit to handle these man s size schemes any longer peddling oranges in a push cart is about the suitable graft for me when i said ten thousand i swear i thought i had sized up that brown man s limit to within two cents he d have melted down for fifteen thousand just as easy say carry you ll see old man keogh safe in some nice quiet idiot asylum won t you if he makes a break like that again the casa morena although only one story in height was a building of brown stone luxurious as a palace in its interior it stood on a low hill in a walled garden of splendid tropical flora at the upper edge of coralio the next day the president s carriage came again for the artist keogh went out for a walk along the beach where he and his picture box were now familiar sights when he returned to the hotel white was sitting in a steamer chair on the balcony well said keogh did you and his nibs decide on the kind of a chromo he wants white got up and walked back and forth on the balcony a few times then he stopped and laughed strangely his face was flushed and his eyes were bright with a kind of angry amusement look here billy he said somewhat roughly when you first came to me in my studio and mentioned a picture i thought you wanted a smashed oats or a hair tonic poster painted on a range of mountains or the side of a continent well either of those jobs would have been art in its highest form compared to the one you ve steered me against i can t paint that picture billy you ve got to let me out let me try to tell you what that barbarian wants he had it all planned out and even a sketch made of his idea the old boy doesn t draw badly at all but ye goddesses of art listen to the monstrosity he expects me to paint he wants himself in the center of the canvas of course he is to be painted as jupiter sitting on olympus with the clouds at his feet at one side of him stands george washington in full regimentals with his hand on the president s shoulder an angel with outstretched wings hovers overhead and is placing a laurel wreath on the president s head crowning him queen of the may i suppose in the background is to be cannon more angels and soldiers the man who would paint that picture would have to have the soul of a dog and would deserve to go down into oblivion without even a tin can tied to his tail to sound his memory little beads of moisture crept out all over billy keogh s brow the stub of his blue pencil had not figured out a contingency like this the machinery of his plan had run with flattering smoothness until now he dragged another chair upon the balcony and got white back to his seat he lit his pipe with apparent calm now sonny he said with gentle grimness you and me will have an art to art talk you ve got your art and i ve got mine yours is the real pierian stuff that turns up its nose at bock beer signs and oleographs of the old mill mine s the art of business this was my scheme and it worked out like two and two paint that president man as old king cole or venus or a landscape or a fresco or a bunch of lilies or anything he thinks he looks like but get the paint on the canvas and collect the spoils you wouldn t throw me down carry at this stage of the game think of that ten thousand i can t help thinking of it said white and that s what hurts i m tempted to throw every ideal i ever had down in the mire and steep my soul in infamy by painting that picture that five thousand meant three years of foreign study to me and i d almost sell my soul for that now it ain t as bad as that said keogh soothingly it s a business proposition it s so much paint and time against money i don t fall in with your idea that that picture would so everlastingly jolt the art side

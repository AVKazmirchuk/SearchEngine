out of its faithful grove they saw the long lane with its convoy of walnut trees running from the road to the house they smelled the wild rose and the breath of cool damp willows in the creek s bed and then in unison all the voices of the soil began a chant addressed to the soul of robert walmsley out of the tilted aisles of the dim wood they came hollowly they chirped and buzzed from the parched grass they trilled from the ripples of the creek ford they floated up in clear pan s pipe notes from the dimming meadows the whippoorwills joined in as they pursued midges in the upper air slow going cow bells struck out a homely accompaniment and this was what each one said you ve found your way back at last have you the old voices of the soil spoke to him leaf and bud and blossom conversed with him in the old vocabu lary of his careless youth the inanimate things the familiar stones and rails the gates and furrows and roofs and turns of the road had an eloquence too and a power in the transformation the country had smiled and he had felt the breath of it and his heart was drawn as if in a moment back to his old love the city was far away this rural atavism then seized robert walmsley and possessed him a queer thing he noticed in con nection with it was that alicia sitting at his side suddenly seemed to him a stranger she did not be long to this recurrent phase never before had she seemed so remote so colorless and high so intan gible and unreal and yet he had never admired her more than when she sat there by him in the rickety spring wagon chiming no more with his mood and with her environment than the matterhorn chimes with a peasant s cabbage garden that night when the greetings and the supper were over the entire family including buff the yellow dog bestrewed itself upon the front porch alicia not haughty but silent sat in the shadow dressed in an exquisite pale gray tea gown robert s mother dis coursed to her happily concerning marmalade and lumbago tom sat on the top step sisters millie and pam on the lowest step to catch the lightning bugs mother had the willow rocker father sat in the big armchair with one of its arms gone buff sprawled in the middle of the porch in everybody s way the twilight pixies and pucks stole forth un seen and plunged other poignant shafts of memory into the heart of robert a rural madness entered his soul the city was far away father sat without his pipe writhing in his heavy boots a sacrifice to rigid courtesy robert shouted no you don t he fetched the pipe and lit it he seized the old gentleman s boots and tore them off the last one slipped suddenly and mr robert walmsley of washington square tumbled off the porch backward with buff on top of him bowling fearfully tom laughed sarcastically robert tore off his coat and vest and hurled them into a lilac bush come out here you landlubber be cried to tom and i ll put grass seed on your back i think you called me a dude a while ago come along and cut your capers tom understood the invitation and accepted it with delight three times they wrestled on the grass side holds even as the giants of the mat and twice was tom forced to bite grass at the hands of the distinguished lawyer dishevelled panting each still boasting of his own prowess they stumbled back to the porch millie cast a pert reflection upon the qualities of a city brother in an instant robert had secured a horrid katydid in his fingers and bore down upon her screaming wildly she fled up the lane pursued by the avenging glass of form a quarter of a mile and they returned she full of apology to the victorious dude the rustic mania possessed him unabatedly i can do up a cowpenful of you slow hayseeds he proclaimed vaingloriously bring on your bull dogs your hired men and your log rollers he turned handsprings on the grass that prodded tom to envious sarcasm and then with a whoop he clattered to the rear and brought back uncle like a battered colored retainer of the family with his banjo and strewed sand on the porch and danced chicken in the bread tray and did buck and wing wonders for half an hour longer incredibly wild and boisterous things he did he sang he told stories that set all but one shrieking he played the yokel the humorous clodhopper he was mad and with the revival of the old life in his blood he became so extravagant that once his mother sought gently to reprove him then alicia moved as though she were about to speak but she did not through it all she sat immovable a slim white spirit in the dusk that no man might question or read by and by she asked permission to ascend to her room saying that she was tired on her way she passed robert he was standing in the door the figure of vulgar comedy with ruffled hair reddened face and unpardonable confusion of attire no trace there of the immaculate robert walmsley the courted clubman and ornament of select circles he was do ing a conjuring trick with some household utensils and the family now won over to him without excep tion was beholding him with worshipful admiration as alicia passed in robert started suddenly he had forgotten for the moment that she was

stopped before joe s booth dabster wore a silk hat and well daisy was a woman and that hat had no chance to get back in its box until joe had seen it a stick of pineapple chewing gum was the ostensible object of the call joe supplied it through the open side of his store he did not pale or falter at sight of the hat mr dabster s going to take me on top of the building to observe the view said daisy after she had introduced her admirers i never was on a skyscraper i guess it must be awfully nice and funny up there h m said joe the panorama said mr dabster exposed to the gaze from the top of a lofty building is not only sublime but instructive miss daisy has a decided pleasure in store for her it s windy up there too as well as here said joe are you dressed warm enough daise sure thing i m all lined said daisy smiling slyly at his clouded brow you look just like a mummy in a case joe ain t you just put in an invoice of a pint of peanuts or another apple your stock looks awful over stocked daisy giggled at her favorite joke and joe had to smile with her your quarters are somewhat limited mr er er remarked dabster in comparison with the size of this building i understand the area of its side to be about by feet that would make you occupy a proportionate space as if half of beloochistan were placed upon a territory as large as the united states east of the rocky mountains with the province of ontario and belgium added is that so sport said joe genially you are weisenheimer on figures all right how many square pounds of baled hay do you think a jackass could eat if he stopped brayin long enough to keep still a minute and five eighths a few minutes later daisy and mr dabster stepped from an elevator to the top floor of the skyscraper then up a short steep stairway and out upon the roof dabster led her to the parapet so she could look down at the black dots moving in the street below what are they she asked trembling she had never before been on a height like this before and then dabster must needs play the philosopher on the tower and conduct her soul forth to meet the immensity of space bipeds he said solemnly see what they become even at the small elevation of feet mere crawling insects going to and fro at random oh they ain t anything of the kind exclaimed daisy suddenly they re folks i saw an automobile oh gee are we that high up walk over this way said dabster he showed her the great city lying like an orderly array of toys far below starred here and there early as it was by the first beacon lights of the winter afternoon and then the bay and sea to the south and east vanishing mysteriously into the sky i don t like it declared daisy with troubled blue eyes say we go down but the philosopher was not to be denied his opportunity he would let her behold the grandeur of his mind the half nelson he had on the infinite and the memory he had for statistics and then she would nevermore be content to buy chewing gum aat the smallest store in new york and so he began to prate of the smallness of human affairs and how that even so slight a removal from earth made man and his works look like one tenth part of a dollar thrice computed and that one should consider the sidereal system and the maxims of epictetus and be comforted you don t carry me with you said daisy say i think it s awful to be up so high that folks look like fleas one of them we saw might have been joe why jiminy we might as well be in new jersey say i m afraid up here the philosopher smiled fatuously the earth said he is itself only as a grain of wheat in space look up there daisy gazed upward apprehensively the short day was spent and the stars were coming out above yonder star said dabster is venus the evening star she is miles from the sun fudge said daisy with a brief flash of spirit where do you think i come from brooklyn susie price in our store her brother sent her a ticket to go to san francisco that s only three thousand miles the philosopher smiled indulgently our world he said is miles from the sun there are eighteen stars of the first magnitude that are times further from us than the sun is if one of them should be extinguished it would be three years before we would see its light go out there are six thousand stars of the sixth magnitude it takes thirty six years for the light of one of them to reach the earth with an eighteen foot telescope we can see stars including those of the thirteenth magnitude whose light takes years to reach us each of these stars you re lyin cried daisy angrily you re tryin to scare me and you have i want to go down she stamped her foot arcturus began the philosopher soothingly but he was interrupted by a demonstration out of the vastness of the nature that he was endeavoring to portray with his memory instead of his heart for to the heart expounder of nature the stars were set in the firmament expressly to give soft light to lovers wandering happily beneath them and if you stand tiptoe some september night with your sweetheart on your arm you can almost touch them with your hand three years for their light to reach us indeed out of

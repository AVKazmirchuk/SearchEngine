and took a week to study out where we should go i reckon the first passenger agent in the world was that man genesis but there wasn t much competition in his day and when he said the lord made the earth in six days and all very good he hadn t any idea to what extent the press agents of the summer hotels would plagiarize from him later on when we finished the booklets we perceived easy that the united states from passadumkeg maine to el paso and from skagway to key west was a paradise of glorious mountain peaks crystal lakes new laid eggs golf girls garages cooling breezes straw rides open plumbing and tennis and all within two hours ride so me and andy dumps the books out the back window and packs our trunk and takes the o clock tortoise flyer for crow knob a kind of a dernier resort in the mountains on the line of tennessee and north carolina we was directed to a kind of private hotel called woodchuck inn and thither me and andy bent and almost broke our footsteps over the rocks and stumps the inn set back from the road in a big grove of trees and it looked fine with its broad porches and a lot of women in white dresses rocking in the shade the rest of crow knob was a post office and some scenery set an angle of forty five degrees and a welkin well sir when we got to the gate who do you suppose comes down the walk to greet us old smoke em out smithers who used to be the best open air painless dentist and electric liver pad faker in the southwest old smoke em out is dressed clerico rural and has the mingled air of a landlord and a claim jumper which aspect he corroborates by telling us that he is the host and perpetrator of woodchuck inn i introduces andy and we talk about a few volatile topics such as will go around at meetings of boards of directors and old associates like us three were old smoke em out leads us into a kind of summer house in the yard near the gate and took up the harp of life and smote on all the chords with his mighty right gents

season opened i gets a letter signed lieut peary and one from the duke of marlborough each wanting to engage board for part of the summer well sir you gents know what a big thing for an obscure hustlery it would be to have for guests two gentlemen whose names are famous from long association with icebergs and the coburgs so i prints a lot of handbills announcing that woodchuck inn would shelter these distinguished boarders during the summer except in places where it leaked and i sends em out to towns around as far as knoxville and charlotte and fish dam and bowling green and now look

wooden market house stood on a patch of short trimmed grass under the vivid green foliage of a bread fruit tree thither one morning the venders leisurely convened bringing their wares with them a porch or platform six feet wide encircled the building shaded from the mid morning sun by the projecting grass thatched roof upon this platform the venders were wont to display their goods newly

those three cigars while considering the problem for it amounted to a problem he almost wished that he had not found the bottle but the bottle was there why should it have drifted in from the sea whence come so many disquieting things to disturb his peace in this dreamy land where time seemed so redundant he had fallen into the habit of bestowing much thought upon even trifling matters he bagan to speculate upon many fanciful theories concerning the story of the bottle rejecting each in turn ships in danger of wreck or disablement sometimes cast forth such precarious messengers calling for aid but he had seen the idalia not three hours before safe and speeding suppose the crew had mutinied and imprisoned the passengers below and the message was one begging for succor but premising such an improbable outrage would the agitated captives have taken the pains to fill four pages of note paper with carefully penned arguments to their rescue thus by elimination he soon rid the matter of the more unlikely theories and was reduced though aversely to the less assailable ones that the bottle contained a message to himself ida knew he was in coralio she must have launched the bottle while the yacht was passing and the wind blowing fairly toward the shore as soon as geddie reached this conclusion a wrinkle came between his brows and a stubborn look settled around his mouth he sat looking out through the doorway at the gigantic fire flies traversing the quiet streets if this was a message to him from ida what could it mean save an overture at reconciliation and if that why had she not used the same methods of the post instead of this uncertain and even flippant means of communication a note in an empty bottle cast into the sea there was something light and frivolous about it if not actually contemptuous the thought stirred his pride and subdued whatever emotions had been resurrected by the finding of the bottle geddie put on his coat and hat and walked out he followed a street that led him along the border of the little plaza where a band was playing and people were rambling care free and indolent some timorous senoritas scurrying past with fire flies tangled in the jetty braids of their hair glanced at him with shy flattering eyes the air was languorous with the scent of jasmin and orange blossoms the consul stayed his steps at the house of bernard brannigan paula was swinging in a hammock on the gallery she rose from it like a bird from its nest the color came to her cheeck at the sound of geddie s voice he was charmed at the sight of her costume a flounced muslin dress with a little jacket of white flannel all made with neatness and style he suggested a stroll and they walked out to the old indian well on the hill road they sat on the curb and there geddie made the expected but long deferred speech certain though he had been that she would not say him nay he was still thrilled at the completeness and sweetness of her surrender here was surely a heart made for love and steadfastness here was no caprice or questionings or captious standards of convention when geddie kissed paula at her door that night he was happier than he had ever been before here in this hollow lotus land ever to live and lie reclined seemed to him as it has seemed to many mariners the best as well as the easiest his future would be an ideal one he had attained a paradise without a serpent his eve would be indeed a part of him unbeguiled and therefore more beguiling he had made his decision tonight and his heart was full of serene assured content geddie went back to his house whistling that finest and saddest love song la golondrina at the door his tame monkey leaped down from his shelf chattering briskly the consul turned to his desk to get him some nuts he usually kept there reaching in the half darkness his hand struck against the bottle he started as if he had touched the cold rotundity of a serpent he had forgotten that the bottle was there he lighted the lamp and fed the monkey then very deliberately he lighted a cigar and took the bottle in his hand and walked down the path to the beach there was a moon and the sea was glorious the breeze had shifted as it did each evening and was now rushing steadily seaward stepping to the water s edge geddie hurled the unopened bottle far out into the sea it disappeared for a moment and then shot upward twice its length geddie stood still watching it the moonlight was so bright that he could see it bobbing up and down with the little waves slowly it receded from the shore flashing and turning as it went the wind was carrying it out to sea soon it became a mere speck doubtfully discerned at irregular intervals and then the mystery of it was swallowed up by the greater mystery of the ocean geddie stood still upon the beach smoking and looking out upon the water simon oh simon wake up there simon bawled a sonorous voice at the edge of the water old simon cruz was a half breed fisherman and smuggler who lived in a hut on the beach out of his earliest nap simon was thus awakened he slipped on his shoes and went outside just landing from one of the valhalla s boats was the third mate of that vessel who was an acquaintance of simon s and three sailors from the fruiter go up simon called the mate and find doctor gregg or mr goodwin or anybody that s a friend to mr geddie and bring em here at once saints of the skies

of death when the world is so beautiful says miss rosa laying her hand on his shoulder do something to please me walter go home to your rest and say i mean to get better and do it if you ask it says the boy with a smile i will the waiter brings full glasses did they ring no but it is well he may leave them a farewell glass miss rosa says to your better health walter he says to our next meeting his eyes look no longer into the void but gaze upon the antithesis of death his foot is set in an undiscovered country to night he is obedient ready to go good night she says i never kissed a girl before he confesses except my sisters you didn t this time she laughs i kissed you good night when shall i see you again he persists you promised me to go home she frowns and get well perhaps we shall meet again soon good night he hesitates his hat in hand she smiles broadly and kisses him once more upon the forehead she watches him far down the aisle then sits again at the table the shadow falls once more against the wall this time the big softly stepping man parts the curtains and looks in miss rosa s eyes meet his and for half a minute they remain thus silent fighting a battle with that king of weapons presently the big man drops the curtains and passes on the orchestra ceases playing suddenly and an important voice can be heard loudly talking in one of the boxes farther down the aisle no doubt some citizen entertains there some visitor to the town and miss rosa leans back in her chair and smiles at some of the words she catches purest atmosphere in the world litmus paper all long nothing hurtful our city nothing but pure ozone the waiter returns for the tray and glasses as he enters the girl crushes a little empty pasteboard box in her hand and throws it in a corner she is stirring something in her glass with her hatpin why miss rosa says the waiter with the civil familiarity he uses putting salt in your beer this early in the night the friendly call published in monthly magazine section july when i used to sell hardware in the west i often made a little town called saltillo in colorado i was always certain of securing a small or a large order from simon bell who kept a general store there bell was one of those six foot low voiced products formed from a union of the west and the south i liked him to look at him you would think he should be robbing stage coaches or juggling gold mines with both hands but he would sell you a paper of tacks or a spool of thread with ten times more patience and courtesy than any saleslady in a city department store i had a twofold object in my last visit to saltillo one was to sell a bill of goods the other to advise bell of a chance that i knew of by which i was certain he could make a small fortune in mountain city a town on the union pacific five times larger than saltillo a mercantile firm was about to go to the wall it had a lively and growing custom but was on the edge of dissolution and ruin mismanagement

on their coats and hats and left for their homes bell padlocked the big double wooden front doors and we stood for a moment breathing the keen fresh mountain air coming across the foothills a big man walked down the street and stopped in front of the high porch of the store his long black moustache black eyebrows and curly black hair contrasted queerly with his light pink complexion which belonged by rights to a blonde he was about forty and wore a white vest a white hat a watch chain made of five dollar gold pieces linked together and a rather well fitting two piece gray suit of the cut that college boys of eighteen are wont to affect he glanced at me distrustfully and then at bell with coldness and i thought something of enmity in his expression well asked bell as if he were addressing a

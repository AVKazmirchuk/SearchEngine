gent s gold watch worth two hundred a gent s leather pocket book that we afterward found to contain six hundred dollars a calibre revolver and the only thing of the lot that could have been a lady s personal property was a silver bracelet worth about fifty cents i said madame here s your property and handed her the bracelet now i went on how can you expect us to act square with you when you try to deceive us in this manner i m surprised at such conduct the young woman flushed up as if she had been caught doing something dishonest some other woman down the line called out the mean thing i never knew whether she meant the other lady or me when we finished our job we ordered everybody back to bed told em good night very politely at the door and left we rode forty miles before daylight and then divided the stuff each one of us got in money we lumped the jewellery around then we scattered each man for himself that was my first train robbery and it was about as easily done as any of the ones that followed but that was the last and only time i ever went through the passengers i don t like that part of the business afterward i stuck strictly to the express car during the next eight years i handled a good deal of money the best haul i made was just seven years after the first one we found out about a train that was going to bring out a lot of money to pay off the soldiers at a government post we stuck that train up in broad daylight five of us lay in the sand hills near a little station ten soldiers were guarding the money on the train but they might just as well have been at home on a furlough we didn t even allow them to stick their heads out the windows to see the fun we had no trouble at all in getting the money which was all in gold of course a big howl was raised at the time about the robbery it was government stuff and the government got sarcastic and wanted to know what the convoy of soldiers went along for the only excuse given was that nobody was expecting an attack among those bare sand hills in daytime i don t know what the government thought about the excuse but i know that it was a good one the surprise that is the keynote of the train robbing business the papers published all k inds of stories about the loss finally agreeing that it was between nine thousand and ten thousand dollars the government sawed wood here are the correct figures printed for the first time forty eight thousand dollars if anybody will take the trouble to look over uncle sam s private accounts for that little debit to profit and loss he will find that i am right to a cent by that time we were expert enough to know what to do we rode due west twenty miles making a trail that a broadway policeman could have followed and then we doubled back hiding our tracks on the second night after the hold up while posses were scouring the country in every direction jim and i were eating supper in the second story of a friend s house in the town where the alarm started from our friend pointed out to us in an office across the street a printing press at work striking off handbills offering a reward for our capture i have been asked what we do with the money we get well i never could account for a tenth part of it after it was spent it goes fast and freely an outlaw has to have a good many friends a highly respected citizen may and often does get along with very few but a man on the dodge has got to have sidekickers with angry posses and reward hungry officers cutting out a hot trail for him he must have a few places scattered about the country where he can stop and feed himself and his horse and get a few hours sleep without having to keep both eyes open when he makes a haul he feels like dropping some of the coin with these friends and he does it liberally sometimes i have at the end of a hasty visit at one of these havens of refuge flung a handful of gold and bills into the laps of the kids playing on the floor without knowing whether my contribution was a hundred dollars or a thousand when old timers make a big haul they generally go far away to one of the big cities to spend their money green hands however successful a hold up they make nearly always give themselves away by showing too much money near the place where they got it i was in a job in where we got twenty thousand dollars we followed our favourite plan for a get away that is doubled on our trail and laid low for a time near the scene of the train s bad luck one morning i picked up a newspaper and read an article with big headlines stating that the marshal with eight deputies and a posse of thirty armed citizens had the train robbers surrounded in a mesquite thicket on the cimarron and that it was a question of only a few hours when they would be dead men or prisoners while i was reading that article i was sitting at breakfast in one of the most elegant private residences in washington city with a flunky in knee pants standing behind my chair jim was sitting across the table talking to his half uncle a retired naval officer whose name you have often seen in the accounts of doings in the capital

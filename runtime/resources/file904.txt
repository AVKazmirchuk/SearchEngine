street car we found the seats all occupied principally by ladies jolnes and i stood on the rear platform about the middle of the car there sat an elderly man with a short gray beard who looked to be the typical well dressed new yorker at successive corners other ladies climbed aboard and soon three or four of them were standing over the man clinging to straps and glaring meaningly at the man who occupied the coveted seat but he resolutely retained his place we new yorkers i remarked to jolnes have about lost our manners as far as the exercise of them in public goes perhaps so said jolnes lightly but the man you evidently refer to happens to be a very chivalrous and courteous gentleman from old virginia he is spending a few days in new york with his wife and two daughters and he leaves for the south to night you know him then i said in amazement i never saw him before we stepped on the car declared the detective smilingly by the gold tooth of the witch of endor i cried if you can construe all that from his appearance you are dealing in nothing else than black art the habit of observation nothing more said jolnes if the old gentleman gets off the car before we do i think i can demonstrate to you the accuracy of my deduction three blocks farther along the gentleman rose to leave the car jolnes addressed him at the door pardon me sir but are you not colonel hunter of norfolk virginia no suh was the extremely courteous answer my name suh is ellison major winfield r ellison from fairfax county in the same state i know a good many people suh in norfolk the goodriches the tollivers and the crabtrees suh but i never had the pleasure of meeting yo friend colonel hunter i am happy to say suh that i am going back to virginia to night after having spent a week in yo city with my wife and three daughters i shall be in norfolk in about ten days and if you will give me yo name suh i will take pleasure in looking up colonel hunter and telling him that you inquired after him suh thank you said jolnes tell him that reynolds sent his regards if you will be so kind i glanced at the great new york detective and saw that a look of intense chagrin had come upon his clear cut features failure in the slightest point always galled shamrock jolnes did you say your three daughters he asked of the virginia gentleman yes suh my three daughters all as fine girls as there are in fairfax county was the answer with that major ellison stopped the car and began to descend the step shamrock jolnes clutched his arm one moment sir he begged in an urbane voice in which i alone detected the anxiety am i not right in believing that one of the young ladies is an adopted daughter you are suh admitted the major from the ground but how the devil you knew it suh is mo than i can tell and mo than i can tell too i said as the car went on jolnes was restored to his calm observant serenity by having wrested victory from his apparent failure so after we got off the car he invited me into a cafe promising to reveal the process of his latest wonderful feat in the first place he began after we were comfortably seated i knew the gentleman was no new yorker because he was flushed and uneasy and restless on account of the ladies that were standing although he did not rise and give them his seat i decided from his appearance that he was a southerner rather than a westerner next i began to figure out his reason for not relinquishing his seat to a lady when he evidently felt strongly but not overpoweringly impelled to do so i very quickly decided upon that i noticed that one of his eyes had received a severe jab in one corner which was red and inflamed and that all over his face were tiny round marks about the size of the end of an uncut lead pencil also upon both of his patent leather shoes were a number of deep imprints shaped like ovals cut off square at one end now there is only one district in new york city where a man is bound to receive scars and wounds and indentations of that sort and that is along the sidewalks of twenty third street and a portion of sixth avenue south of there i knew from the imprints of trampling french heels on his feet and the marks of countless jabs in the face from umbrellas and parasols carried by women in the shopping district that he had been in conflict with the amazonian troops and as he was a man of intelligent appearance i knew he would not have braved such dangers unless he had been dragged thither by his own women folk therefore when he got on the car his anger at the treatment he had received was sufficient to make him keep his seat in spite of his traditions of southern chivalry that is all very well i said but why did you insist upon daughters and especially two daughters why couldn t a wife alone have taken him shopping there had to be daughters said jolnes calmly if he had only a wife and she near his own age he could have bluffed her into going alone if he had a young wife she would prefer to go alone so there you are i ll admit that i said but now why two daughters and how in the name of all the prophets did you guess that one was adopted when he told you he had three don t say guess said jolnes with a touch of pride in his air there is no such word in the lexicon of ratiocination in major ellison s buttonhole there was a carnation and a rosebud backed by a geranium leaf no woman ever combined a carnation and a rosebud into a boutonniere close your eyes whatsup and give the logic of your imagination a chance cannot you see the lovely adele fastening the carnation to the lapel so that papa may be gay upon the street and then the romping edith may dancing up with sisterly jealousy to add her rosebud to the adornment and then i cried beginning to feel enthusiasm when he declared that he had three daughters i could see said jolnes one in the background who added no flower and i knew that she must be adopted i broke in i give you every credit but how did you know he was leaving for the south to night in his breast pocket said the great detective something large and oval made a protuberance good liquor is scarce on trains and it is a long journey from new york to fairfax county again i must bow to you i said and tell me this so that my last shred of doubt will be cleared away why did you decide that he was from virginia it was very faint i admit answered shamrock jolnes but no trained observer could have failed to detect the odour of mint in the car the lady higher up new york city they said was deserted and that accounted doubtless for the sounds carrying so far in the tranquil summer air the breeze was south by southwest the hour was midnight the theme was a bit of feminine gossip by wireless mythology three hundred and sixty five feet above the heated asphalt the tiptoeing symbolic deity on manhattan pointed her vacillating arrow straight for the time in the direction of her exalted sister on liberty island the lights of the great garden were out the b enches in the square were filled with sleepers in postures so strange that beside them the writhing figures in dore s illustrations of the inferno would have straightened into tailor s dummies the statue of diana on the tower of the garden its constancy shown by its weathercock ways its innocence by the coating of gold that it has acquired its devotion to style by its single graceful flying scarf its candour and artlessness by its habit of ever drawing the long bow its metropolitanism by its posture of swift flight to catch a harlem train remained poised with its arrow pointed across the upper bay had that arrow sped truly and horizontally it would have passed fifty feet above the head of the heroic matron whose duty it is to offer a cast ironical welcome to the oppressed of other lands seaward this lady gazed and the furrows between steamship lines began to cut steerage rates the translators too have put an extra burden upon her liberty lighting the world as her creator christened her would have had a no more responsible duty except for the size of it than that of an electrician or a standard oil magnate but to enlighten the world as our learned civic guardians englished it requires abler qualities and so poor liberty instead of having a sinecure as a mere illuminator must be converted into a chautauqua schoolma am with the oceans for her field instead of the placid classic lake with a fireless torch and an empty head must she dispel the shadows of the world and teach it its a b c s ah there mrs liberty called a clear rollicking soprano voice through the still midnight air is that you miss diana excuse my not turning my head i m not as flighty and whirly whirly as some and tis so hoarse i am i can hardly talk on account of the peanut hulls left on the stairs in me throat by that last boatload of tourists from marietta ohio tis after being a fine evening miss if you don t mind my asking came the bell like tones of the golden statue i d like to know where you got that city hall brogue i didn t know that liberty was necessarily irish if ye d studied the history of art in its foreign complications ye d not need to ask replied the offshore statue if ye wasn t so light headed and giddy ye d know that i was made by a dago and presented to the american people on behalf of the french government for the purpose of welcomin irish immigrants into the dutch city of new york tis that i ve been doing night and day since i was erected ye must know miss diana that tis with statues the same as with people tis not their makers nor the purposes for which they were created that influence the operations of their tongues at all it s the associations with which they become associated i m telling ye you re dead right agreed diana i notice it on myself if any of the old guys from olympus were to come along and hand me any hot air in the ancient greek i couldn t tell it from a conversation between a coney island car conductor and a five cent fare i m right glad ye ve made up your mind to be sociable miss diana said mrs liberty tis a lonesome life i have down here is there anything doin up in the city miss diana dear oh la la la no said diana notice that la la la aunt liberty got that from paris by night on the roof garden under me you ll hear that la la la at the cafe mccann now along with garsong the bohemian crowd there have become tired of garsong since o rafferty the head waiter punched three of them for calling him it oh no the town s strickly on the bum these nights everybody s away saw a downtown merchant on a roof garden this evening with his stenographer show was so dull he went to sleep a waiter biting on a dime tip to see if it was good half woke him up he looks around and sees his little pothooks perpetrator h m says he will you take a letter miss de st montmorency sure in a minute says she if you ll make it an x that was the best thing happened on the roof so you see how dull it is la la la tis fine ye have it up there in society miss diana ye have the cat show and the horse show and the military tournaments where the privates look grand as generals and the generals try to look grand as floor walkers and ye have the sportsmen s show where the girl that measures cooks breakfast food in a birch bark wigwam on the banks of the grand canal of venice conducted by one of the vanderbilts bernard mcfadden and the reverends dowie and duss and ye have the french ball where the original cohens and the robert emmet sangerbund society dance the highland fling one with another and ye have the grand o ryan ball which is the most beautiful pageant in the world where the french students vie with the tyrolean warblers in doin the cake walk ye have the best job for a statue in the whole town miss diana tis weary work sighed the island statue disseminatin the science of liberty in new york bay sometimes when i take a peep down at ellis island and see the gang of immigrants i m supposed to light up tis tempted i am to blow out the gas and let the coroner write out their naturalization papers say it s a shame ain t it to give you the worst end of it came the sympathetic antiphony of the steeplechase goddess it must be awfully lonesome down there with so much water around you i don t see how you ever keep your hair in curl and that mother hubbard you are wearing went out ten years ago i think those sculptor guys ought to be held for damages for putting iron or marble clothes on a lady that s where mr st gaudens was wise i m always e little ahead of the styles but they re coming my way pretty fast excuse my back a moment i caught a puff of wind from the north shouldn t wonder if things had loosened up in esopus there now it s in the west i should think that gold plank would have calmed the air out in that direction what were you saying mrs liberty a fine chat i ve had with ye miss diana ma am but i see one of them european steamers a sailin up the narrows and i must be attendin to me duties tis me job to extend aloft the torch of liberty to welcome all them that survive the kicks that the steerage stewards give em while landin sure tis a great country ye can come to for and the doctor waitin to send ye back home free if he sees yer eyes red from cryin for it the golden statue veered in the changing breeze menacing many points on the horizon with its aureate arrow so long aunt liberty sweetly called diana of the tower some night when the wind s right i ll call you up again but say you haven t got such a fierce kick coming about your job i ve kept a pretty good watch on the island of manhattan since i ve been up here that s a pretty sick looking bunch of liberty chasers they dump down at your end of it but they don t all stay that way every little while up here i see guys signing checks and voting the right ticket and encouraging the arts and t aking a bath every morning that was shoved ashore by a dock labourer born in the united states who never earned over forty dollars a month don t run down your job aunt liberty you re all right all right the greater coney next sunday said dennis carnahan i ll be after going down to see the new coney island that s risen like a phoenix bird from the ashes of the old resort i m going with norah flynn and we ll fall victims to all the dry goods deceptions from the red flannel eruption of mount vesuvius to the pink silk ribbons on the race suicide problems in the incubator kiosk was i there before i was i was there last tuesday did i see the sights i did not last monday i amalgamated myself with the bricklayers union and in accordance with the rules i was ordered to quit work the same day on account of a sympathy strike with the lady salmon canners lodge no of tacoma washington twas disturbed i was in mind and proclivities by losing me job bein already harassed in me soul on account of havin quarrelled with norah flynn a week before by reason of hard words spoken at the dairymen and street sprinkler drivers semi annual ball caused by jealousy and prickly heat and that divil andy coghlin so i says it will be coney for tuesday and if the chutes and the short change and the green corn silk between the teeth don t create diversions and get me feeling better then i don t know at all ye will have heard that coney has received moral reconstruction the old bowery where they used to take your tintype by force and give ye knockout drops before having your palm read is now called the wall street of the island the wienerwurst stands are required by law to keep a news ticker in em and the doughnuts are examined every four years by a retired steamboat inspector the nigger man s head that was used by the old patrons to throw baseballs at is now illegal and by order of the police commissioner the image of a man drivin an automobile has been substituted i hear that the old immoral amusements have been suppressed people who used to go down from new york to sit in the sand and dabble in the surf now give up their quarters to squeeze through turnstiles and see imitations of city fires and floods painted on canvas the reprehensible and degradin resorts that disgraced old coney are said to be wiped out the wipin out process consists of raisin the price from cents to cents and hirin a blonde named maudie to sell tickets instead of micky the bowery bite that s what they say i don t know but to coney i goes a tuesday i gets off the l and starts for the glitterin show twas a fine sight the babylonian towers and the hindoo roof gardens was blazin with thousands of electric lights and the streets was thick with people tis a true thing they say that coney levels all rank i see millionaires eatin popcorn and trampin along with the crowd and i see eight dollar a week clothin store clerks in red automobiles fightin one another for who d squeeze the horn when they come to a corner i made a mistake i says to myself twas not coney i needed when a man s sad tis not scenes of hilarity he wants twould be far better for him to meditate in a graveyard or to attend services at the paradise roof gardens tis no consolation when a man s lost his sweetheart to order hot corn and have the waiter bring him the powdered sugar cruet instead of salt and then conceal himself or to have zozookum the gipsy palmist tell him that he has three children and to look out for another serious calamity price twenty five cents i walked far away down on the beach to the ruins of an old pavilion near one corner of this new private park dreamland a year ago that old pavilion was standin up straight and the old style waiters was slammin a week s supply of clam chowder down in front of you for a nickel and callin you cully friendly and vice was rampant and you got back to new york with enough change to take a car at the bridge now they tell me that they serve welsh rabbits on surf avenue and you get the right change back in the movin picture joints i sat down at one side of the old pavilion and looked at the surf spreadin itself on the beach and thought about the time me and norah flynn sat on that spot last summer twas before reform struck the island and we was happy we had tintypes and chowder in the ribald dives and the egyptian sorceress of the nile told norah out of her hand while i was waitin in the door that twould be the luck of her to marry a red headed gossoon with two crooked legs and i was overrunnin with joy on account of the allusion and twas there that norah flynn put her two hands in mine a year before and we talked of flats and the things she could cook and the love business that goes with such episodes and that was coney as we loved it and as the hand of satan was upon it friendly and noisy and your money s worth with no fence around the ocean and not too many electric lights to show the sleeve of a black serge coat against a white shirtwaist i sat with my back to the parks where they had the moon and the dreams and the steeples corralled and longed for the old coney there wasn t many people on the beach lots of them was feedin pennies into the slot machines to see the interrupted courtship in the movin pictures and a good many was takin the sea air in the canals of venice and some was breathin the smoke of the sea battle by actual warships in a tank filled with real water a few was down on the sands enjoyin the moonlight and the water and the heart of me was heavy for the new morals of the old island while the bands behind me played and the sea pounded on the bass drum in front and directly i got up and walked along the old pavilion and there on the other side of half in the dark was a slip of a girl sittin on the tumble down timbers and unless i m a liar she was cryin by herself there all alone is it trouble you are in now miss says i and what s to be done about it tis none of your business at all denny carnahan says she sittin up straight and it was the voice of no other than norah flynn then it s not says i and we re after having a pleasant evening miss flynn have ye seen the sights of this new coney island then i presume ye have come here for that purpose says i i have says she me mother and uncle tim they are waiting beyond tis an elegant evening i ve had i ve seen all the attractions that be right ye are says i to norah and i don t know when i ve been that amused after disportin me self among the most laughable moral improvements of the revised shell games i took meself to the shore for the benefit of the cool air and did ye observe the durbar miss flynn i did says she reflectin but tis not safe i m thinkin to ride down them slantin things into the water how did ye fancy the shoot the chutes i asks true then i m afraid of guns says norah they make such noise in my ears but uncle tim he shot them he did and won cigars tis a fine time we had this day mr carnahan i m glad you ve enjoyed yerself i says i suppose you ve had a roarin fine time seein the sights and how did the incubators and the helter skelter and the midgets suit the taste of ye i i wasn t hungry says norah faint but mother ate a quantity of all of em i m that pleased with the fine things in the new coney island says she that it s the happiest day i ve seen in a long time at all did you see venice says i we did says she she was a beauty she was all dressed in red she was with i listened no more to norah flynn i stepped up and i gathered her in my arms tis a story teller ye are norah flynn says i ye ve seen no more of the greater coney island than i have meself come now tell the truth ye came to sit by the old pavilion by the waves where you sat last summer and made dennis carnahan a happy man speak up and tell the truth norah stuck her nose against me vest i despise it denny she says half cryin mother and uncle tim went to see the shows but i came down here to think of you i couldn t bear the lights and the crowd are you forgivin me denny for the words we had twas me fault says i i came here for the same reason meself look at the lights norah i says turning my back to the sea ain t they pretty they are says norah with her eyes shinin and do ye hear the bands playin oh denny i think i d like to see it all the old coney is gone darlin i says to her everything moves when a man s glad it s not scenes of sadness he wants tis a greater coney we have here but we couldn t see it till we got in the humour for it next sunday norah darlin we ll see the new place from end to end law and order i found myself in texas recently revisiting old places and vistas at a sheep ranch where i had sojourned many years ago i stopped for a week and as all visitors do i heartily plunged into the business at hand which happened to be that of dipping the sheep now this process is so different from ordinary human baptism that it deserves a word of itself a vast iron cauldron with half the fires of avernus beneath it is partly filled with water that soon boils furiously into that is cast concentrated lye lime and sulphur which is allowed to stew and fume until the witches broth is strong enough to scorch the third arm of palladino herself then this concentrated brew is mixed in a long deep vat with cubic gallons of hot water and the sheep are caught by their hind legs and flung into the compound after being thoroughly ducked by means of a forked pole in the hands of a gentleman detailed for that purpose they are allowed to clamber up an incline into a corral and dry or die as the state of their constitutions may decree if you ever caught an able bodied two year old mutton by the hind legs and felt the volts of kicking that he can send though your arm seventeen times before you can hurl him into the vat you will of course hope that he may die instead of dry but this is merely to explain why bud oakley and i gladly stretched ourselves on the bank of the nearby charco after the dipping glad for the welcome inanition and pure contact with the earth after our muscle racking labours the flock was a small one and we finished at three in the afternoon so bud brought from the morral on his saddle horn coffee and a coffeepot and a big hunk of bread and some side bacon mr mills the ranch owner and my old friend rode away to the ranch with his force of mexican trabajadores while the bacon was frizzling nicely there was the sound of horses hoofs behind us bud s six shooter lay in its scabbard ten feet away from his hand he paid not the slightest heed to the approaching horseman this attitude of a texas ranchman was so different from the old time custom that i marvelled instinctively i turned to inspect the possible foe that menaced us in the rear i saw a horseman dressed in black who might have been a lawyer or a parson or an undertaker trotting peaceably along the road by the arroyo bud noticed my precautionary movement and smiled sarcastically and sorrowfully you ve been away too long said he you don t need to look around any more when anybody gallops up behind you in this state unless something hits you in the back and even then it s liable to be only a bunch of tracts or a petition to sign against the trusts i never looked at that hombre that rode by but i ll bet a quart of sheep dip that he s some double dyed son of a popgun out rounding up prohibition votes times have changed bud said i oracularly law and order is the rule now in the south and the southwest i caught a cold gleam from bud s pale blue eyes not that i i began hastily of course you don t said bud warmly you know better you ve lived here before law and order you say twenty years ago we had em here we only had two or three laws such as against murder before witnesses and being caught stealing horses and voting the republican ticket but how is it now all we get is orders and the laws go out of the state them legislators set up there at austin and don t do nothing but make laws against kerosene oil and schoolbooks being brought into the state i re ckon they was afraid some man would go home some evening after work and light up and get an education and go to work and make laws to repeal aforesaid laws me i m for the old days when law and order meant what they said a law was a law and a order was a order but i began i was going on continued bud while this coffee is boiling to describe to you a case of genuine law and order that i knew of once in the times when cases was decided in the chambers of a six shooter instead of a supreme court you ve heard of old ben kirkman the cattle king his ranch run from the nueces to the rio grande in them days as you know there was cattle barons and cattle kings the difference was this when a cattleman went to san antone and bought beer for the newspaper reporters and only give them the number of cattle he actually owned they wrote him up for a baron when he bought em champagne wine and added in the amount of cattle he had stole they called him a king luke summers was one of his range bosses and down to the king s ranch comes one day a bunch of these oriental people from new york or kansas city or thereabouts luke was detailed with a squad to ride about with em and see that the rattlesnakes got fair warning when they was coming and drive the deer out of their way among the bunch was a black eyed girl that wore a number two shoe that s all i noticed about her but luke must have seen more for he married her one day before the caballard started back and went over on canada verde and set up a ranch of his own i m skipping over the sentimental stuff on purpose because i never saw or wanted to see any of it and luke takes me along with him because we was old friends and i handled cattle to suit him i m skipping over much what followed because i never saw or wanted to see any of it but three years afterward there was a boy kid stumbling and blubbering around the galleries and floors of luke s ranch i never had no use for kids but it seems they did and i m skipping over much what followed until one day out to the ranch drives in hacks and buckboards a lot of mrs summers s friends from the east a sister or so and two or three men one looked like an uncle to somebody and one looked like nothing and the other one had on corkscrew pants and spoke in a tone of voice i never liked a man who spoke in a tone of voice i m skipping over much what followed but one afternoon when i rides up to the ranch house to get some orders about a drove of beeves that was to be shipped i hears something like a popgun go off i waits at the hitching rack not wishing to intrude on private affairs in a little while luke comes out and gives some orders to some of his mexican hands and they go and hitch up sundry and divers vehicles and mighty soon out comes one of the sisters or so and some of the two or three men but two of the two or thee men carries between em the corkscrew man who spoke in a tone of voice and lays him flat down in one of the wagons and they all might have been seen wending their way away bud says luke to me i want you to fix up a little and go up to san antone with me let me get on my mexican spurs says i and i m your company one of the sisters or so seems to have stayed at the ranch with mrs summers and the kid we rides to encinal and catches the international and hits san antone in the morning after breakfast luke steers me straight to the office of a lawyer they go in a room and talk and then come out oh there won t be any trouble mr summers says the lawyer i ll acquaint judge simmons with the facts to day and the matter will be put through as promptly as possible law and order reigns in this state as swift and sure as any in the country i ll wait for the decree if it won t take over half an hour says luke tut tut says the lawyer man law must take its course come back day after to morrow at half past nine at that time me and luke shows up and the lawyer hands him a folded document and luke writes him out a check on the sidewalk luke holds up the paper to me and puts a finger the size of a kitchen door latch on it and says decree of ab so lute divorce with cus to dy of the child skipping over much what has happened of which i know nothing says i it looks to me like a split couldn t the lawyer man have made it a strike for you bud says he in a pained style that child is the one thing i have to live for she may go but the boy is mine think of it i have cus to dy of the child all right says i if it s the law let s abide by it but i think says i that judge simmons might have used exemplary clemency or whatever is the legal term in our case you see i wasn t inveigled much into the desirableness of having infants around a ranch except the kind that feed themselves and sell for so much on the hoof when they grow up but luke was struck with that sort of parental foolishness that i never could understand all the way riding from the station back to the ranch he kept pulling that decree out of his pocket and laying his finger on the back of it and reading off to me the sum and substance of it cus to dy of the child bud says he don t forget it cus to dy of the child but when we hits the ranch we finds our decree of court obviated nolle prossed and remanded for trial mrs summers and the kid was gone they tell us that an hour after me and luke had started for san antone she had a team hitched and lit out for the nearest station with her trunks and the youngster luke takes out his decree once more and reads off its emoluments it ain t possible bud says he for this to be it s contrary to law and order it s wrote as plain as day here cus to dy of the child there is what you might call a human leaning says i toward smashing em both not to mention the child judge simmons goes on luke is a incorporated officer of the law she can t take the boy away he belongs to me by statutes passed and approved by the state of texas and he s removed from the jurisdiction of mundane mandamuses says i by the unearthly statutes of female partiality let us praise the lord and be thankful for whatever small mercies i begins but i see luke don t listen to me tired as he was he calls for a fresh horse and starts back again for the station he come back two weeks afterward not saying much we can t get the trail says he but we ve done all the telegraphing that the wires ll stand and we ve got these city rangers they call detectives on the lookout in the meantime bud says he we ll round up them cows on brush creek and wait for the law to take its course and after that we never alluded to allusions as you might say skipping over much what happened in the next twelve years luke was made sheriff of mojada county he made me his office deputy now don t get in your mind no wrong apparitions of a office deputy doing sums in a book or mashing letters in a cider press in them days his job was to watch the back windows so nobody didn t plug the sheriff in the rear while he was adding up mileage at his desk in front and in them days i had qualifications for the job and there was law and order in mojada county and schoolbooks and all the whiskey you wanted and the government built its own battleships instead of collecting nickels from the school children to do it with and as i say there was law and order instead of enactments and restrictions such as disfigure our umpire state to day we had our office at bildad the county seat from which we emerged forth on necessary occasions to soothe whatever fracases and unrest that might occur in our jurisdiction skipping over much what happened while me and luke was sheriff i want to give you an idea of how the law was respected in them days luke was what you would call one of the most conscious men in the world he never knew much book law but he had the inner emoluments of justice and mercy inculcated into his system if a respectable citizen shot a mexican or held up a train and cleaned out the safe in the express car and luke ever got hold of him he d give the guilty party such a reprimand and a cussin out that he d probable never do it again but once let somebody steal a horse unless it was a spanish pony or cut a wire fence or otherwise impair the peace and indignity of mojada county luke and me would be on em with habeas corpuses and smokeless powder and all the modern inventions of equity and etiquette we certainly had our county on a basis of lawfulness i ve known persons of eastern classification with little spotted caps and buttoned up shoes to get off the train at bildad and eat sandwiches at the railroad station without being shot at or even roped and drug about by the citizens of the town luke had his own ideas of legality and justice he was kind of training me to succeed him when he went out of office he was always looking ahead to the time when he d quit sheriffing what he wanted to do was to build a yellow house with lattice work under the porch and have hens scratching in the yard the one main thing in his mind seemed to be the yard bud he says to me by instinct and sentiment i m a contractor i want to be a contractor that s what i ll be when i get out of office what kind of a contractor says i it sounds like a kind of a business to me you ain t going to haul cement or establish branches or work on a railroad are you you don t understand says luke i m tired of space and horizons and territory and distances and things like that what i want is reasonable contraction i want a yard with a fence around it that you can go out and set on after supper and listen to whip poor wills says luke that s the kind of a man he was he was home like although he d had bad luck in such investments but he never talked about them times on the ranch it seemed like he d forgotten about it i wondered how with his ideas of yards and chickens and notions of lattice work he d seemed to have got out of his mind that kid of his that had been taken away from him unlawful in spite of his decree of court but he wasn t a man you could ask about such things as he didn t refer to in his own conversation i reckon he d put all his emotions and ideas into being sheriff i ve read in books about men that was disappointed in these poetic and fine haired and high collared affairs with ladies renouncing truck of that kind and wrapping themselves up into some occupation like painting pictures or herding sheep or science or teaching school something to make em forget well i guess that was the way with luke but as he couldn t paint pictures he took it out in rounding up horse thieves and in making mojada county a safe place to sleep in if you was well armed and not afraid of requisitions or tarantulas one day there passes through bildad a bunch of these money investors from the east and they stopped off there bildad being the dinner station on the i g n they was just coming back from mexico looking after mines and such there was five of em four solid parties with gold watch chains that would grade up over two hundred pounds on the hoof and one kid about seventeen or eighteen this youngster had on one of them cowboy suits such as tenderfoots bring west with em and you could see he was aching to wing a couple of indians or bag a grizzly or two with the little pearl handled gun he had buckled around his waist i walked down to the depot to keep an eye on the outfit and see that they didn t locate any land or scare the cow ponies hitched in front of murchison s store or act otherwise unseemly luke was away after a gang of cattle thieves down on the frio and i always looked after the law and order when he wasn t there after dinner this boy comes out of the dining room while the train was waiting and prances up and down the platform ready to shoot all antelope lions or private citizens that might endeavour to molest or come too near him he was a good looking kid only he was like all them tenderfoots he didn t know a law and order town when he saw it by and by along comes pedro johnson the proprietor of the crystal palace chili con carne stand in bildad pedro was a man who liked to amuse himself so he kind of herd rides this youngster laughing at him tickled to death i was too far away to hear but the kid seems to mention some remarks to pedro and pedro goes up and slaps him about nine feet away and laughs harder than ever and then the boy gets up quicker than he fell and jerks out his little pearl handle and bing bing bing pedro gets it three times in special and treasured portions of his carcass i saw the dust fly off his clothes every time the bullets hit sometimes them little thirty twos cause worry at close range the engine bell was ringing and the train starting off slow i goes up to the kid and places him under arrest and takes away his gun but the first thing i knew that caballard of capitalists makes a break for the train one of em hesitates in front of me for a second and kind of smiles and shoves his hand up against my chin and i sort of laid down on the platform and took a nap i never was afraid of guns but i don t want any person except a barber to take liberties like that with my face again when i woke up the whole outfit train boy and all was gone i asked about pedro and they told me the doctor said he would recover provided his wounds didn t turn out to be fatal when luke got back three days later and i told him about it he was mad all over why n t you telegraph to san antone he asks and have the bunch arrested there oh well says i i always did admire telegraphy but astronomy was what i had took up just then that capitalist sure knew how to gesticulate with his hands luke got madder and madder he investigates and finds in the depot a card one of the men had dropped that gives the address of some hombre called scudder in new york city bud says luke i m going after that bunch i m going there and get the man or boy as you say he was and bring him back i m sheriff of mojada county and i shall keep law and order in its precincts while i m able to draw a gun and i want you to go with me no eastern yankee can shoot up a respectable and well known citizen of bildad specially with a thirty two calibre and escape the law pedro johnson says luke is one of our most prominent citizens and business men i ll appoint sam bel l acting sheriff with penitentiary powers while i m away and you and me will take the six forty five northbound to morrow evening and follow up this trail i m your company says i i never see this new york but i d like to but luke says i don t you have to have a dispensation or a habeas corpus or something from the state when you reach out that far for rich men and malefactors did i have a requisition says luke when i went over into the brazos bottoms and brought back bill grimes and two more for holding up the international did me and you have a search warrant or a posse comitatus when we rounded up them six mexican cow thieves down in hidalgo it s my business to keep order in mojada county and it s my business as office deputy says i to see that business is carried on according to law between us both we ought to keep things pretty well cleaned up so the next day luke packs a blanket and some collars and his mileage book in a haversack and him and me hits the breeze for new york it was a powerful long ride the seats in the cars was too short for six footers like us to sleep comfortable on and the conductor had to keep us from getting off at every town that had five story houses in it but we got there finally and we seemed to see right away that he was right about it luke says i as office deputy and from a law standpoint it don t look to me like this place is properly and legally in the jurisdiction of mojada county texas from the standpoint of order says he it s amenable to answer for its sins to the properly appointed authorities from bildad to jerusalem amen says i but let s turn our trick sudden and ride i don t like the looks of this place think of pedro johnson says luke a friend of mine and yours shot down by one of these gilded abolitionists at his very door it was at the door of the freight depot says i but the law will not be balked at a quibble like that we put up at one of them big hotels on broadway the next morning i goes down about two miles of stairsteps to the bottom and hunts for luke it ain t no use it looks like san jacinto day in san antone there s a thousand folks milling around in a kind of a roofed over plaza with marble pavements and trees growing right out of em and i see no more chance of finding luke than if we was hunting each other in the big pear flat down below old fort ewell but soon luke and me runs together in one of the turns of them marble alleys it ain t no use bud says he i can t find no place to eat at i ve been looking for restaurant signs and smelling for ham all over the camp but i m used to going hungry when i have to now says he i m going out and get a hack and ride down to the address on this scudder card you stay here and try to hustle some grub but i doubt if you ll find it i wish we d brought along some cornmeal and bacon and beans i ll be back when i see this scudder if the trail ain t wiped out so i starts foraging for breakfast for the honour of old mojada county i didn t want to seem green to them abolitionists so every time i turned a corner in them marble halls i went up to the first desk or counter i see and looks around for grub if i didn t see what i wanted i asked for something else in about half an hour i had a dozen cigars five story magazines and seven or eight railroad time tables in my pockets and never a smell of coffee or bacon to point out the trail once a lady sitting at a table and playing a game kind of like pushpin told me to go into a closet that she called number i went in and shut the door and the blamed thing lit itself up i set down on a stool before a shelf and waited thinks i this is a private dining room but no waiter never came when i got to sweating good and hard i goes out again did you get what you wanted says she no ma am says i not a bite then there s no charge says she thanky ma am says i and i takes up the trail again by and by i thinks i ll shed etiquette and i picks up one of them boys with blue clothes and yellow buttons in front and he leads me to what he calls the caffay breakfast room and the first thing i lays my eyes on when i go in is that boy that had shot pedro johnson he was setting all alone at a little table hitting a egg with a spoon like he was afraid he d break it i takes the chair across the table from him and he looks insulted and makes a move like he was going to get up keep still son says i you re apprehended arrested and in charge of the texas authorities go on and hammer that egg some more if it s the inside of it you want now what did you shoot mr johnson of bildad for and may i ask who you are says he you may says i go ahead i suppose you re on says this kid without batting his eyes but what are you eating here waiter he calls out raising his finger take this gentleman s order a beefsteak says i and some fried eggs and a can of peaches and a quart of coffee will about suffice we talk awhile about the sundries of life and then he says what are you going to do about that shooting i had a right to shoot that man says he he called me names that i couldn t overlook and then he struck me he carried a gun too what else could i do we ll have to take you back to texas says i i d like to go back says the boy with a kind of a grin if it wasn t on an occasion of this kind it s the life i like i ve always wanted to ride and shoot and live in the open air ever since i can remember who was this gang of stout parties you took this trip with i asks my stepfather says he and some business partners of his in some mexican mining and land schemes i saw you shoot pedro johnson says i and i took that little popgun away from you that you did it with and when i did so i noticed three or four little scars in a row over your right eyebrow you ve been in rookus before haven t you i ve had these scars ever since i can remember says he i don t know how they came there was you ever in texas before says i not that i remember of says he but i thought i had when we struck the prairie country but i guess i hadn t have you got a mother i asks she died five years ago says he skipping over the most of what followed when luke came back i turned the kid over to him he had seen scudder and told him what he wanted and it seems that scudder got active with one of these telephones as soon as he left for in about an hour afterward there comes to our hotel some of these city rangers in everyday clothes that they call detectives and marches the whole outfit of us to what they call a magistrate s court they accuse luke of at tempted kidnapping and ask him what he has to say this snipe says luke to the judge shot and wilfully punctured with malice and forethought one of the most respected and prominent citizens of the town of bildad texas your honor and in so doing laid himself liable to the penitence of law and order and i hereby make claim and demand restitution of the state of new york city for the said alleged criminal and i know he done it have you the usual and necessary requisition papers from the governor of your state asks the judge my usual papers says luke was taken away from me at the hotel by these gentlemen who represent law and order in your city they was two colt s s that i ve packed for nine years and if i don t get em back there ll be more trouble you can ask anybody in mojada county about luke summers i don t usually need any other kind of papers for what i do i see the judge looks mad so i steps up and says your honor the aforesaid defendant mr luke summers sheriff of mojada county texas is as fine a man as ever threw a rope or upheld the statutes and codicils of the greatest state in the union but he the judge hits his table with a wooden hammer and asks who i am bud oakley says i office deputy of the sheriff s office of mojada county texas representing says i the law luke summers i goes on represents order and if your honor will give me about ten minutes in private talk i ll explain the whole thing to you and show you the equitable and legal requisition papers which i carry in my pocket the judge kind of half smiles and says he will talk with me in his private room in there i put the whole thing up to him in such language as i had and when we goes outside he announces the verdict that the young man is delivered into the hands of the texas authorities and calls the next case skipping over much of what happened on the way back i ll tell you how the thing wound up in bildad when we got the prisoner in the sheriff s office i says to luke you remember that kid of yours that two year old that they stole away from you when the bust up come luke looks black and angry he d never let anybody talk to him about that business and he never mentioned it himself toe the mark says i do you remember when he was toddling around on the porch and fell down on a pair of mexican spurs and cut four little holes over his right eye look at the prisoner says i look at his nose and the shape of his head and why you old fool don t you know your own son i knew him says i when he perforated mr johnson at the depot luke comes over to me shaking all over i never saw him lose his nerve before bud says he i ve never had that boy out of my mind one day or one night since he was took away but i never let on but can we hold him can we make him stay i ll make the best man of him that ever put his foot in a stirrup wait a minute says he all excited and out of his mind i ve got some thing here in my desk i reckon it ll hold legal yet i ve looked at it a thousand times cus to dy of the child says luke cus to dy of the child we can hold him on that can t we le me see if i can find that decree

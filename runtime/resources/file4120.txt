it with almost the last money i had he looked at me but he couldn t keep his eyes off her for more than a second do you remember the night bess he said when we stood under one of those on the bank of the bayou and what you told me then geewillikins i said to myself both of them stand under a rubber plant seems to me they are stretching matters somewhat do i not says she looking up at him and sneaking close to his vest and now i say it again and it is to last forever look dick at its leaves how wet they are those are my tears and it was thinking of you that made them fall the dear old magnolias says the young man pinching one of my leaves i love them all magnolia well wouldn t that say those innocents thought i was a magnolia what the well wasn t that tough on a genuine little old new york rubber plant out of nazareth okochee in georgia had a boom and j pinkney bloom came out of it with a wad okochee came out of it with a half million dollar debt a two and a half per cent city property tax and a city council that showed a propensity for traveling the back streets of the town these things came about through a fatal resemblance of the river cooloosa to the hudson as set forth and expounded by a northern tourist okochee felt that new york should not be allowed to consider itself the only alligator in the swamp so to speak and then that harmless but persistent individual so numerous in the south the man who is always clamoring for more cotton mills and is ready to take a dollar s worth of stock provided he can borrow the dollar that man added his deadly work to the tourist s innocent praise and okochee fell the cooloosa river winds through a range of small mountains passes okochee and then blends its waters trippingly as fall the mellifluous indian syllables with the chattahoochee okochee rose as it were from its sunny seat on the post office stoop hitched up its suspender and threw a granite dam two hundred and forty feet long and sixty feet high across the cooloosa one mile above the town thereupon a dimpling sparkling lake backed up twenty miles among the little mountains thus in the great game of municipal rivalry did okochee match that famous drawing card the hudson it was conceded that nowhere could the palisades be judged superior in the way of scenery and grandeur following the picture card was played the ace of commercial importance fourteen thousand horsepower would this dam furnish cotton mills factories and manufacturing plants would rise up as the green corn after a shower the spindle and the flywheel and turbine would sing the shrewd glory of okochee along the picturesque heights above the lake would rise in beauty the costly villas and the splendid summer residences of capital the naphtha launch of the millionaire would spit among the romantic coves the verdured hills would take formal shapes of terrace lawn and park money would be spent like water in okochee and water would be turned into money the fate of the good town is quickly told capital decided not to invest of all the great things promised the scenery alone came to fulfilment the wooded peaks the impressive promontories of solemn granite the beautiful green slants of bank and ravine did all they could to reconcile okochee to the delinquency of miserly gold the sunsets gilded the dreamy draws and coves with a minting that should charm away heart burning okochee true to the instinct of its blood and clime was lulled by the spell it climbed out of the arena loosed its suspender sat down again on the post office stoop and took a chew it consoled itself by drawling sarcasms at the city council which was not to blame causing the fathers as has been said to seek back streets and figure perspiringly on the sinking fund and the appropriation for interest due the youth of okochee they who were to carry into the rosy future the burden of the debt accepted failure with youth s uncalculating joy for here was sport aquatic and nautical added to the meagre round of life s pleasures in yachting caps and flowing neckties they pervaded the lake to its limits girls wore silk waists embroidered with anchors in blue and pink the trousers of the young men widened at the bottom and their hands were proudly calloused by the oft plied oar fishermen were under the spell of a deep and tolerant jjoy sailboats and rowboats furrowed the lenient waves popcorn and ice cream booths sprang up about the little wooden pier two small excursion steamboats were built and plied the delectable waters okochee philosophically gave up the hope of eating turtle soup with a gold spoon and settled back not ill content to its regular diet of lotus and fried hominy and out of this slow wreck of great expectations rose up j pinkney bloom with his wad and his prosperous cheery smile needless to say j pinkney was no product of georgia soil he came out of that flushed and capable region known as the north he called himself a promoter his enemies had spoken of him as a grafter okochee took a middle course and held him to be no better nor no worse than a yank far up the lake eighteen miles above the town the eye of this cheerful camp follower of booms had spied out a graft he purchased there a precipitous tract of five hundred acres at forty five cents per acre and this he laid out and subdivided as the city of skyland the queen city of the switzerland of the south streets and avenues were surveyed parks designed corners of central squares reserved for the proposed opera house board of trade lyceum market public schools and exposition hall the price of lots ranged from five to five hundred dollars positively no lot would be priced higher than five hundred dollars while the boom was growing in okochee j pinkney s circulars maps and prospectuses were flying through the mails to every part of the country investors sent in their money by post and the skyland real estate company j pinkney bloom returned to each a deed duly placed on record to the best lot at the price on hand that day all this time the catamount screeched upon the reserved lot of the skyland board of trade the opossum swung by his tail over the site of the exposition hall and the owl hooted a melancholy recitative to his audience of young squirrels in opera house square later when the money was coming in fast j pinkney caused to be erected in the coming city half a dozen cheap box houses and persuaded a contingent of indigent natives to occupy them thereby assuming the role of poulation in subsequent prospectuses which became accordingly more seductive and remunerative so when the dream faded and okochee dropped back to digging bait and nursing its two and a half per cent tax j pinkney bloom unloving of checks and drafts and the cold interrogatories of bankers strapped about his fifty two inch waist a soft leather belt containing eight thousand dollars in big bills and said that all was very good one last trip he was making to skyland before departing to other salad fields skyland was a regular post office and the steamboat dixie belle under contract delivered the mail bag generally empty twice a week there was a little business there to be settled the postmaster was to be paid off for his light but lonely services and the inhabitants had to be furnished with another month s homely rations as per agreement and then skyland would know j pinkney bloom no more the owners of these precipitous barren useless lots might come and view the scene of their invested credulity or they might leave them to their fit tenants the wild hog and the browsing deer the work of the skyland real estate company was finished the little steamboat dixie belle was about to shove off on her regular up the lake trip when a rickety hired carriage rattled up to the pier and a tall elderly gentleman in black stepped out signaling courteously but vivaciously for the boat to wait time was of the least importance in the schedule of the dixie belle captain macfarland gave the order and the boat received its ultimate two passengers for upon the arm of the tall elderly gentleman as he crossed the gangway was a little elderly lady with a gray curl depending quaintly forward of her left ear captain macfarland was at the wheel therefore it seemed to j pinkney bloom who was the only other passenger that it should be his to play the part of host to the boat s new guests who were doubtless on a scenery viewing expedition he stepped forward with that translucent child candid smile upon his fresh pink countenance with that air of unaffected sincerity that was redeemed from bluffness only by its exquisite calculation with that promptitude and masterly decision of manner that so well suited his calling with all his stock in trade well to the front he stepped forward to receive colonel and mrs peyton blaylock with the grace of a grand marshal or a wedding usher he escorted the two passengers to a side of the upper deck from which the scenery was supposed to present itself to the observer in increased quantity and quality there in comfortable steamer chairs they sat and began to piece together the random lines that were to form an intelligent paragraph in the big history of little events our home sir said colonel blaylock removing his wide brimmed rather shapeless black felt hat is in holly springs holly springs georgia i am very proud to make your acquaintance mr bloom mrs blaylock and myself have just arrived in okochee this morning sir on business business of importance in connection with the recent rapid march of progress in this section of our state the colonel smoothed back with a sweeping gesture his long smooth locks his dark eyes still fiery under the heavy black brows seemed inappropriate to the face of a business man he looked rather to be an old courtier handed down from the reign of charles and re attired in a modern suit of fine but raveling and seam worn broadcloth yes sir said mr bloom in his heartiest prospectus voice things have been whizzing around okochee biggest industrial revival and waking up to natural resources georgia ever had did you happen to squeeze in on the ground floor in any of the gilt edged grafts colonel well sir said the colonel hesitating in courteous doubt if i understand your question i may say that i took the opportunity to make an investment that i believe will prove quite advantageous yes sir i believe it will result in both pecuniary profit and agreeable occupation colonel blaylock said the little edlerly lady shaking her gray curl and smiling indulgent explanation at j pinkney bloom is so devoted to businesss he has such a talent for financiering and markets and investments and those kind of things i think myself extremely fortunate in having secured him for a partner on life s journey i am so unversed in those formidable but very useful branches of learning colonel blaylock rose and made a bow a bow that belonged with silk stockings and lace ruffles and velvet practical affairs he said with a wave of his hand toward the promoter are if i may use the comparison the garden walks upon which we tread through life viewing upon either side of us the flowers which brighten that journey it is my pleasure to be able to lay out a walk or two mrs blaylock sir is one of those fortunate higher spirits whose mission it is to make the flowers grow perhaps mr bloom you have perused the lines of lorella the southern poetess that is the name above which mrs blaylock has contributed to the press of the south for many years unfortunately said mr bloom with a sense of the loss clearly written upon his frank face i m like the colonel in the walk making business myself and i haven t had time to even take a sniff at the flowers poetry is a line i never dealt in it must be nice though quite nice it is the region smiled mrs blaylock in which my soul dwells my shawl peyton if you please the breeze comes a little chilly from yon verdured hills the colonel drew from the tail pocket of his coat a small shawl of knitted silk and laid it solicitously about the shoulders of the lady mrs blaylock sighed contentedly and turned her expressive eyes still as clear and unworldly as a child s upon the steep slopes that were slowly slipping past very fair and stately they looked in the clear morning air they seemed to speak in familiar terms to the responsive spirit of lorella my native hills she murmured dreamily see how the foliage drinks the sunlight from the hollows and dells mrs blaylock s maiden days said the colonel interpreting her mood to j pinkney bloom were spent among the mountains of northern georgia mountain air and mountain scenery recall to her those days holly springs where we have lived for twenty years is low and flat i fear that she may have suffered in health and spirits by so long a residence there that is one portent reason for the change we are making my dear can you not recall those lines you wrote entitled i think the georgia hills the poem that was so extensively copied by the southern press and praised so highly by the atlanta critics mrs blaylock turned a glance of speaking tenderness upon the colonel fingered for a moment the silvery curl that drooped upon her bosom then looked again toward the mountains without preliminary or affectation or demurral she began in rather thrilling and more deeply pitched tones to recite these lines the georgia hills the georgia hills oh heart why dost thou pine are not these sheltered lowlands fair with mead and bloom and vine ah as the slow paced river here broods on its natal rills my spirit drifts in longing sweet back to the georgia hills and through the close drawn curtained night i steal on sleep s slow wings back to my heart s ease slopes of pine where end my wanderings oh heaven seems nearer from their tops and farther earthly ills even in dreams if i may but dream of my georgia hills the grass upon their orchard sides is a fine couch to me the common note of each small bird passes all minstrelsy it would not seem so dread a thing if when the reaper wills he might come there and take my hand up in the georgia hills thats great stuff ma am said j pinkney bloom enthusiastically when the poetess had concluded i wish i had looked up poetry more than i have i was raised in the pine hills myself the mountains ever call to their children murmured mrs blaylock i feel that life will take on the rosy hue of hope again in among these beautiful hills peyton a little taste of the currant wine if you will be so good the journey though delightful in the extreme slightly fatigues me colonel blaylock again visited the depths of his prolific coat and produced a tightly corked rough black bottle mr bloom was on his feet in an instant let me bring a glass ma am you come along colonel there s a little table we can bring too maybe we can scare up some fruit or a cup of tea on board i ll ask mac mrs blaylock reclined at ease few royal ladies have held their royal prerogative with the serene grace of the petted southern woman the colonel with an air as gallant and assiduous as in the days of his courtship and j pinkney bloom with a ponderous agility half professional and half directed by some resurrected unnamed long forgotten sentiment formed a diversified but attentive court the currant wine wine home made from the holly springs fruit went round and then j pinkney began to hear something of holly springs life it seemed from the conversation of the blaylocks that the springs was decadent a third of the population had moved away business and the colonel was an authority on business had dwindled to nothing after carefully studying the field of opportunities open to capital he had sold his little property there for eight hundred dollars and invested it in one of the enterprises opened up by the book in okochee might i inquire sir said mr bloom in what particular line of business you inserted your coin i know that town as well as i know the regulations for illegal use of the mails i might give you a hunch as to whether you can make the game go or not j pinkney somehow had a kindly feeling toward these unsophisticated representatives of by gone days they were so simple impractical and unsuspecting he was glad that he happened not to have a gold brick or a block of that western bad boy silver mine stock along with him he would have disliked to unload on people he liked so well as he did these but there are some temptations toe enticing to be resisted no sir said colonel blaylock pausing to arrange the queen s wrap i did not invest in okochee i have made an exhaustive study of business conditions and i regard old settled towns as unfavorable fields in which to place capital that is limited in amount some months ago through the kindness of a friend there came into my hands a map and description of this new town of skyland that has been built upon the lake the description was so pleasing the future of the town set forth in such convincing arguments and its increasing prosperity portrayed in such an attractive style that i decided to take advantage of the opportunity it offered i carefully selected a lot in the centre of the business district although its price was the highest in the schedule five hundred dollars and made the purchase at once are you the man i mean did you pay five hundred dollars for a lot in skyland asked j pinkney bloom i did sir answered the colonel with the air of a modest millionaire explaining his success a lot most excellently situated on the same square with the opera house and only two squares from the board of trade i consider the purchase a most fortuitous one it is my intention to erect a small building upon it at once and open a modest book and stationery store during past years i have met with many pecuniary reverses and i now find it necessary to engage in some commercial occupation that will furnish me with a livelihood the book and stationery business though an humble one seems to me not inapt nor altogether uncongenial i am a graduate of the university of virginia and mrs blaylock s really wonderful acquaintance with belles lettres and poetic literature should go far toward insuring success of course mrs blaylock would not personally serve behind the counter with the nearly three hundred dollars i have remaining i can manage the building of a house by giving a lien on the lot i have an old friend in atlanta who is a partner in a large book store and he has agreed to furnish me with a stock of goods on credit on extremely easy terms i am pleased to hope sir that mrs blaylock s health and happiness will be increased by the change of locality already i fancy i can perceive the return of those roses that were once the hope and despair of georgia cavaliers again followed that wonderful bow as the colonel lightly touched the pale cheek of the poetess mrs blaylock blushing like a girl shook her curl and gave the colonel an arch reproving tap secret of eternal youth where art thou every second the answer comes here here here listen to thine own heartbeats weary seeker after external miracles those years said mrs blaylock in holly springs were long long long but now is the promised land in sight skyland a lovely name doubtless said the colonel we shall be able to secure comfortable accommodations at some modest hotel at reasonable rates our trunks are in okochee to be forwarded when we shall have made permanent arrangements j pinkney bloom excused himself went forward and stood by the captain at the wheel mac said he do you remember my telling you once that i sold one of those five hundred dollar lots in skyland seems i do grinned captain macfarland i m not a coward as a general rule went on the promoter but i always said that if i ever met the sucker that bought that lot i d run like a turkey now you see that old babe in the wood over there well he s the boy that drew the prize that was the only five hundred dollar lot that went the rest ranged from ten dollars to two hundred his wife writes poetry she s invented one about the high grounds of georgia that s way up in g they re going to skyland to open a book store well said macfarland with another grin it s a good thing you are along j p you can show em around town until they begin to feel at home he s got three hundred dollars left to build a house and store with went on j pinkney as if he were talking to himself and he thinks there s an open house up there captain macfarland released the wheel long enough to give his leg a roguish slap you old fat rascal he chuckled with a wink mac you re a fool said j pinkney bloom coldly he went back and joined the blaylocks where he sat less talkative with that straight furrow between his brows that always stood as a signal of schemes being shaped within there s a good many swindles connected with these booms he said presently what if this skyland should turn out to be one that is suppose business should be sort of dull there and no special sale for books my dear sir said colonel blaylock resting his hand upon the back of his wife s chair three times i have been reduced to almost penury by the duplicity of others but i have not yet lost faith in humanity if i have been deceived again still we may glean health and content if not worldly profit i am aware that there are dishonest schemers in the world who set traps for the unwary but even they are not altogether bad my dear can you recall those verses entitled he giveth the increase that you composed for the choir of our church in holly springs that was four years ago said mrs blaylock perhans i can repeat a verse or two the lily springs from the rotting mould pearls from the deep sea slime good will come out of nazareth all in god s own time to the hardest heart the softening grace cometh at last to bless guiding it right to help and cheer and succor in distress i cannot remember the rest the lines were not ambitious they were written to the music composed by a dear friend it s a fine rhyme just the same declared mr bloom it seems to ring the bell all right i guess i gather the sense of it it means that the rankest kind of a phony will give you the best end of it once in a while mr bloom strayed thoughtfully back to the captain and stood meditating ought to be in sight of the spires and gilded domes of skyland now in a few minutes chirruped macfarland shaking with enjoyment go to the devil said mr bloom still pensive and now upon the left bank they caught a glimpse of a white village high up on the hills smothered among green trees that was cold branch no boom town but the slow growth of many years cold branch lay on the edge of the grape and corn lands the big country road ran just back of the heights cold branch had nothing in common with the frisky ambition of okochee with its impertinent lake mac said j pinkney suddenly i want you to stop at cold branch there s a landing there that they made to use sometimes when the river was up can t said the captain grinning more broadly i ve got the united states mails on board right to day this boat s in the government service do you want to have the poor old captain keelhauled by uncle sam and the great city of skyland all disconsolate waiting for its mail i m ashamed of your extravagance j p mac almost whispered j pinkney in his danger line voice i looked into the engine room of the dixie belle a while ago don t you know of somebody that needs a new boiler cement and black japan can t hide flaws from me and then those shares of building and loan that you traded for repairs they were all yours of course i hate to mention these things but oh come now j p said the captain you know i was just fooling i ll put you off at cold branch if you say so the other passengers get off there too said mr bloom further conversation was held and in ten minutes the dixie belle turned her nose toward a little cranky wooden pier on the left bank and the captain relinquishing the wheel to a roustabout came to the passenger deck and made the remarkable announcement all out for skyland the blaylocks and j pinkney bloom disembarked and the dixie belle proceeded on her way up the lake guided by the indefatigable promoter they slowly climbed the steep hillside pausing often to rest and admire the view finally they entered the village of cold branch warmly both the colonel and his wife praised it for its homelike and peaceful beauty mr bloom conducted them to a two story building on a shady street that bore the legend pine top inn here he took his leave receiving the cordial thanks of the two for his attentions the colonel remarking that he thought they would spend the remainder of the day in rest and take a look at his purchase on the morrow j pinkney bloom walked down cold branch s main street he did not know this town but he knew towns and his feet did not falter presently he saw a sign over a door frank e cooly attorney at law and notary public a young man was mr cooly and awaiting business get your hat son said mr bloom in his breezy way and a blank deed and come along it s a job for you now he continued when mr cooly had responded with alacrity is there a bookstore in town one said the lawyer henry williams s get there said mr bloom we re going to buy it henry williams was behind his counter his store was a small one containing a mixture of books stationery and fancy rubbish adjoining it was henry s home a decent cottage vine embowered and cosy henry was lank and soporific and not inclined to rush his business i want to buy your house and store said mr bloom i haven t got time to dicker name your price it s worth eight hundred said henry too much dazed to ask more than its value shut that door said mr bloom to the lawyer then he tore off his coat and vest and began to unbutton his shirt wanter fight about it do yer said henry williams jumping up and cracking his heels together twice all right hunky sail in and cut yer capers keep your clothes on said mr bloom i m only going down to the bank he drew eight one hundred dollar bills from his money belt and planked them down on the counter mr cooly showed signs of future promise for he already had the deed spread out and was reaching across the counter for the ink bottle never before or since was such quick action had in cold branch your name please asked the lawyer make it out to peyton blaylock said mr bloom god knows how to spell it within thirty minutes henry williams was out of business and mr bloom stood on the brick sidewalk with mr cooly who held in his hand the signed and attested deed you ll find the party at the pinetop inn said j pinkney bloom get it recorded and take it down and give it to him he ll ask you a hell s mint of questions so here s ten dollars for the trouble you ll have in not being able to answer em never run much to poetry did you young man well said the really talented cooly who even yet retained his right mind now and then dig into it said mr bloom it ll pay you never heard a poem now that run something like this did you a good thing out of nazareth comes up sometimes i guess on hand all right to help and cheer a sucker in distress i believe not said mr cooly it s a hymn said j pinkney bloom now show me the way to a livery stable son for i m going to hit the dirt road back to okochee confessions of a humorist there was a painless stage of incubation that lasted twenty five years and then it broke out on me and people said i was it but they called it humor instead of measles the employees in the store bought a silver inkstand for the senior partner on his fiftieth birthday we crowded into his private office to present it i had been selected for spokesman and i made a little speech that i had been preparing for a week it made a hit it was full of puns and epigrams and funny twists that brought down the house which was a very solid one in the wholesale hardware line old marlowe himself actually grinned and the employees took their cue and roared my reputation as a humorist dates from half past nine o clock on that morning for weeks afterward my fellow clerks fanned the flame of my self esteem one by one they came to me saying what an awfully clever speech that was old man and carefully explained to me the point of each one of my jokes gradually i found that i was expected to keep it up others might speak sanely on business matters and the day s topics but from me something gamesome and airy was required i was expected to crack jokes about the crockery and lighten up the granite ware with persiflage i was second bookkeeper and if i failed to show up a balance sheet without something comic about the footings or could find no cause for laughter in an invoice of plows the other clerks were disappointed by degrees my fame spread and i became a local character our town was small enough to make this possible the daily newspaper quoted me at social gatherings i was indispensable i believe i did possess considerable wit and a facility for quick and spontaneous repartee this gift i cultivated and improved by practice and the nature of it was kindly and genial not running to sarcasm or offending others people began to smile when they saw me coming and by the time we had met i generally had the word ready to broaden the smile into a laugh i had married early we had a charming boy of three and a girl of five naturally we lived in a vine covered cottage and were happy my salary as bookkeeper in the hardware concern kept at a distance those ills attendant upon superfluous wealth at sundry times i had written out a few jokes and conceits that i considered peculiarly happy and had sent them to certain periodicals that print such things all of them had been instantly accepted several of the editors had written to request further contributions one day i received a letter from the editor of a famous weekly publication he suggested that i submit to him a humorous composition to fill a column of space hinting that he would make it a regular feature of each issue if the work proved satisfactory i did so and at the end of two weeks he offered to make a contract with me for a year at a figure that was considerably higher than the amount paid me by the hardware firm i was filled with delight my wife already crowned me in her mind with the imperishable evergreens of literary success we had lobster croquettes and a bottle of blackberry wine for supper that night here was the chance to liberate myself from drudgery i talked over the matter very seriously with louisa we agreed that i must resign my place at the store and devote myself to humor i resigned my fellow clerks gave me a farewell banquet the speech i made there coruscated it was printed in full by the gazette the next morning i awoke and looked at the clock late by george i exclaimed and grabbed for my clothes louisa reminded me that i was no longer a slave to hardware and contractors supplies i was now a professional humorist after breakfast she proudly led me to the little room off the kitchen dear girl there was my table and chair writing pad ink and pipe tray and all the author s trappings the celery stand full of fresh roses and honeysuckle last year s calendar on the wall the dictionary and a little bag of chocolates to nibble between inspirations dear girl i sat me to work the wall paper is patterned with arabesques or odalisks or perhaps it is trapezoids upon one of the figures i fixed my eyes i bethought me of humor a voice startled me louisa s voice if you aren t too busy dear it said come to dinner i looked at my watch yes five hours had been gathered in by the grim scytheman i went to dinner you mustn t work too hard at first said louisa goethe or was it napoleon said five hours a day is enough for mental labor couldn t you take me and the children to the woods this afternoon i am a little tired i admitted so we went to the woods but i soon got the swing of it within a month i was turning out copy as regular as shipments of hardware and i had success my column in the weekly made some stir and i was referred to in a gossipy way by the critics as something fresh in the line of humorists i augmented my income considerably by contributing to other publications i picked up the tricks of the trade i could take a funny idea and make a two line joke of it earning a dollar with false whiskers on it would serve up cold as a quatrain doubling its producing value by turning the skirt and adding a ruffle of rhyme you would hardly recognize it as vers de societe with neatly shod feet and a fashion plate illustration i began to save up money and we had new carpets and a parlor organ my townspeople began to look upon me as a citizen of some consequence instead of the merry trifier i had been when i clerked in the hardware store after five or six months the spontaniety seemed to depart from my humor quips and droll sayings no longer fell carelessly from my lips i was sometimes hard run for material i found myself listening to catch available ideas from the conversation of my friends sometimes i chewed my pencil and gazed at the wall paper for hours trying to build up some gay little bubble of unstudied fun and then i became a harpy a moloch a jonah a vampire to my acquaintances anxious haggard greedy i stood among them like a veritable killjoy let a bright saying a witty comparison a piquant phrase fall from their lips and i was after it like a hound springing upon a bone i dared not trust my memory but turning aside guiltily and meanly i would make a note of it in my ever present memorandum book or upon my cuff for my own future use my friends regarded me in sorrow and wonder i was not the same man where once i had furnished them entertainment and jollity i now preyed upon them no jests from me ever bid for their smiles now they were too precious i could not afford to dispense gratuitously the means of my livelihood i was a lugubrious fox praising the singing of my friends the crow s that they might drop from their beaks the morsels of wit that i coveted nearly every one began to avoid me i even forgot how to smile not even paying that much for the sayings i appropriated no persons places times or subjects were exempt from my plundering in search of material even in church my demoralized fancy went hunting among the solemn aisles and pillars for spoil did the minister give out the long meter doxology at once i began doxology sockdology sockdolager meter meet her the sermon ran through my mental sieve its precepts filtering unheeded could i but glean a suggestion of a pun or a bon mot the solemnest anthems of the choir were but an accompaniment to my thoughts as i conceived new changes to ring upon the ancient comicalities concerning the jealousies of soprano tenor and basso my own home became a hunting ground my wife is a singularly feminine creature candid sympathetic and impulsive once her conversation was my delight and her ideas a source of unfailing pleasure now i worked her she was a gold mine of those amusing but lovable inconsistencies that distinguish the female mind i began to market those pearls of unwisdom and humor that should have enriched only the sacred precincts of home with devilish cunning i encouraged her to talk unsuspecting she laid her heart bare upon the cold conspicuous common printed page i offered it to the public gaze a literary judas i kissed her and betrayed her for pieces of silver i dressed her sweet confidences in the pantalettes and frills of folly and made them dance in the market place dear louisa of nights i have bent over her cruel as a wolf above a tender lamb hearkening even to her soft words murmured in sleep hoping to catch an idea for my next day s grind there is worse to come god help me next my fangs were buried deep in the neck of the fugitive sayings of my little children guy and viola were two bright fountains of childish quaint thoughts and speeches i found a ready sale for this kind of humor and was furnishing a regular department in a magazine with funny fancies of childhood i began to stalk them as an indian stalks the antelope i would hide behind sofas and doors or crawl on my hands and knees among the bushes in the yard to eavesdrop while they were at play i had all the qualities of a harpy except remorse once when i was barren of ideas and my copy must leave in the next mail i covered myself in a pile of autumn leaves in the yard where i knew they intended to come to play i cannot bring myself to believe that guy was aware of my hiding place but even if he was i would be loath to blame him for his setting fire to the leaves causing the destruction of my new suit of clothes and nearly cremating a parent soon my own children began to shun me as a pest often when i was creeping upon them like a melancholy ghoul i would hear them say to each other here comes papa and they would gather their toys and scurry away to some safer hiding place miserable wretch that i was and yet i was doing well financially before the first year had passed i had saved a thousand dollars and we had lived in comfort but at what a cost i am not quite clear as to what a pariah is but i was everything that it sounds like i had no friends no amusements no enjoyment of life the happiness of my family had been sacrificed i was a bee sucking sordid honey from life s fairest flowers dreaded and shunned on account of my stingo one day a man spoke to me with a pleasant and friendly smile not in months had the thing happened i was passing the undertaking establishment of peter heffelbower peter stood in the door and saluted me i stopped strangely wrung in my heart by his greeting he asked me inside the day was chill and rainy we went into the back room where a fire burned in a little stove a customer came and peter left me alone for a while presently i felt a new feeling stealing over me a sense of beautiful calm and content i looked around the place there were rows of shining rosewood caskets black palls trestles hearse plumes mourning streamers and all the paraphernalia of the solemn trade here was peace order silence the abode of grave and dignified reflections here on the brink of life was a little niche pervaded by the spirit of eternal rest when i entered it the follies of the world abandoned me at the door i felt no inclination to wrest a humorous idea from those sombre and stately trappings my mind seemed to stretch itself to grateful repose upon a couch draped with gentle thoughts a quarter of an hour ago i was an abandoned humorist now i was a philosopher full of serenity and ease i had found a refuge from humor from the hot chase of the shy quip from the degrading pursuit of the panting joke from the restless reach after the nimble repartee i had not known heffelbower well when he came back i let him talk fearful that he might prove to be a jarring note in the sweet dirgelike harmony of his establishment but no he chimed truly i gave a long sigh of happiness never have i known a man s talk to be as magnificently dull as peter s was compared with it the dead sea is a geyser never a sparkle or a glimmer of wit marred his words commonplaces as trite and as plentiful as blackberries flowed from his lips no more stirring in quality than a last week s tape running from a ticker quaking a little i tried upon him one of my best pointed jokes it fell back ineffectual with the point broken i loved that man from then on two or three evenings each week i would steal down to heffelbower s and revel in his back room that was my only joy i began to rise early and hurry through my work that i might spend more time in my haven in no other place could i throw off my habit of extracting humorous ideas from my surroundings peter s talk left me no opening had i besieged it ever so hard under this influence i began to improve in spirits it was the recreation from one s labor which every man needs i surprised one or two of my former friends by throwing them a smile and a cheery word as i passed them on the streets several times i dumfounded my family by relaxing long enough to make a jocose remark in their presence i had so long been ridden by the incubus of humor that i seized my hours of holiday with a schoolboy s zest mv work began to suffer it was not the pain and burden to me that it had been i often whistled at my desk and wrote with far more fluency than before i accomplished my tasks impatiently as anxious to be off to my helpful retreat as a drunkard is to get to his tavern my wife had some anxious hours in conjecturing where i spent my afternoons i thought it best not to tell her women do not understand these things poor girl she had one shock out of it one day i brought home a silver coffin handle for a paper weight and a fine fluffy hearse plume to dust my papers with i loved to see them on my desk and think of the beloved back room down at heffelbower s but louisa found them and she shrieked with horror i had to console her with some lame excuse for having them but i saw in her eyes that the prejudice was not removed i had to remove the articles though at double quick time one day peter heffelbower laid before me a temptation that swept me off my feet in his sensible uninspired way he showed me his books and explained that his profits and his business were increasing rapidly he had thought of taking in a partner with some cash he would rather have me than any one he knew when i left his place that afternoon peter had my check for the thousand dollars i had in the bank and i was a partner in his undertaking business i went home with feelings of delirious joy mingled with a certain amount of doubt i was dreading to tell my wife about it but i walked on air to give up the writing of humorous stuff once more to enjoy the apples of life instead of squeezing them to a pulp for a few drops of hard cider to make the pubic feel funny what a boon that would be at the supper table louisa handed me some letters that had come during my absence several of them contained rejected manuscript ever since i first began going to heffelbower s my stuff had been coming back with alarming frequency lately i had been dashing off my jokes and articles with the greatest fluency previously i had labored like a bricklayer slowly and with agony presently i opened a letter from the editor of the weekly with which i had a regular contract the checks for that weekly article were still our main dependence the letter ran thus dear sir as you are aware our contract for the year expires with the present month while regretting the necessity for so doing we must say that we do not care to renew same for the coming year we were quite pleased with your style of humor which seems to have delighted quite a large proportion of our readers but for the past two months we have noticed a decided falling off in its quality your earlier work showed a spontaneous easy natural flow of fun and wit of late it is labored studied and unconvincing giving painful evidence of hard toil and drudging mechanism again regretting that we do not consider your contributions available any longer we are yours sincerely the editor i handed this letter to my wife after she had read it her face grew extremely long and there were tears in her eyes the mean old thing she exclaimed indignantly i m sure your pieces are just as good as they ever were and it doesn t take you half as long to write them as it did and then i suppose louisa thought of the checks that would cease coming oh john she wailed what will you do now for an answer i got up and began to do a polka step around the supper table i am sure louisa thought the trouble had driven me mad and i think the children hoped it had for they tore after me yelling with glee and emulating my steps i was now something like their old playmate as of yore the theatre for us to night i shouted nothing less and a late wild disreputable supper for all of us at the palace restaurant lumpty diddle de dee de dum and then i explained my glee by declaring that i was now a partner in a prosperous undertaking establishment and that written jokes might go hide their heads in sackcloth and ashes for all me with the editor s letter in her hand to justify the deed i had done my wife could advance no objections save a few mild ones based on the feminine inability to appreciate a good thing such as the little back room of peter hef no of heffelbower co s undertaking establishment in conclusion i will say that to day you will find no man in our town as well liked as jovial and full of merry sayings as i my jokes are again noised about and quoted once more i take pleasure in my wife s confidential chatter without a mercenary thought while guy and viola play at my feet distributing gems of childish humor without fear of the ghastly tormentor who used to dog their steps notebook in hand our business has prospered finely i keep the books and look after the shop while peter attends to outside matters he says that my levity and high spirits would simply turn any funeral into a regular irish wake the sparrows in madison square the young man in straitened circumstances who comes to new york city to enter literature has but one thing to do provided he has studied carefully his field in advance he must go straight to madison square write an article about the sparrows there and sell it to the sun for i cannot recall either a novel or a story dealing with the popular theme of the young writer from the provinces who comes to the metropolis to win fame and fortune with his pen in which the hero does not get his start that way it does seem strange that some author in casting about for startlingly original plots has not hit upon the idea of having his hero write about the bluebirds in union square and sell it to the herald but a search through the files of metropolitan fiction counts up overwhelmingly for the sparrows and the old garden square and the sun always writes the check of course it is easy to understand why this first city venture of the budding author is always successful he is primed by necessity to a superlative effort mid the iron and stone and marble of the roaring city he has found this spot of singing birds and green grass and trees every tender sentiment in his nature is baffling with the sweet pain of homesickness his genius is aroused as it never may be again the birds chirp the tree branches sway the noise of wheels is forgotten he writes with his soul in his pen and he sells it to the sun for i had read of this custom during many years before i came to new york when my friends were using their strongest arguments to dissuade me from coming i only smiled serenely they did not know of that sparrow graft i had up my sleeve when i arrived in new york and the car took me straight from the ferry up twenty third street to madison square i could hear that check rustling in my inside pocket i obtained lodging at an unhyphenated hostelry and the next morning i was on a bench in madison square almost by the time the sparrows were awake their melodious chirping the benignant spring foliage of the noble trees and the clean fragrant grass reminded me so potently of the old farm i had left that tears almost came into my eyes then all in a moment i felt my inspiration the brave piercing notes of those cheerful small birds formed a keynote to a wonderful light fanciful song of hope and joy and altruism like myself they were creatures with hearts pitched to the tune of woods and fields as i was so were they captives by circumstance in the discordant dull city yet with how much grace and glee they bore the restraint and then the early morning people began to pass through the square to their work sullen people with sidelong glances and glum faces hurrying hurrying hurrying and i got my theme cut out clear from the bird notes and wrought it into a lesson and a poem and a carnival dance and a lullaby and then translated it all into prose and began to write for two hours my pencil traveled over my pad with scarcely a rest then i went to the little room i had rented for two days and there i cut it to half and then mailed it white hot to the sun the next morning i was up by daylight and spent two cents of my capital for a paper if the word sparrow was in it i was unable to find it i took it up to my room and spread it out on the bed and went over it column by column something was wrong three hours afterward the postman brought me a large envelope containing my ms and a piece of inexpensive paper about inches by i suppose some of you have seen them upon which was written in violet ink with the sun s thanks i went over to the square and sat upon a bench no i did not think it necessary to eat any breakfast that morning the confounded pests of sparrows were making the square hideous with their idiotic cheep cheep i never saw birds so persistently noisy impudent and disagreeable in all my life by this time according to all traditions i should have been standing in the office of the editor of the sun that personage a tall grave white haired man would strike a silver bell as he grasped my hand and wiped a suspicious moisture from his glasses mr mcchesney he would be saying when a subordinate appeared this is mr henry the young man who sent in that exquisite gem about the sparrows in madison square you may give him a desk at once your salary sir will be a week to begin with this was what i had been led to expect by all writers who have evolved romances of literary new york something was decidedly wrong with tradition i could not assume the blame so i fixed it upon the sparrows i began to hate them with intensity and heat at that moment an individual wearing an excess of whiskers two hats and a pestilential air slid into the seat beside me say willie he muttered cajolingly could you cough up a dime out of your coffers for a cup of coffee this morning i m lung weary my friend said i the best i can do is three cents and you look like a gentleman too said he what brung you down boozer birds i said fiercely the brown throated songsters carolling songs of hope and cheer to weary man toiling amid the city s dust and din the little feathered couriers from the meadows and woods chirping sweetly to us of blue skies and flowering fields the confounded little squint eyed nuisances yawping like a flock of steam pianos and stuffing themselves like aldermen with grass seeds and bugs while a man sits on a bench and goes without his breakfast yes sir birds look at them as i spoke i picked up a dead tree branch that lay by the bench and hurled it with all my force into a close congregation of the sparrows on the grass the flock flew to the trees with a babel of shrill cries but two of them remained prostrate upon the turf in a moment my unsavory friend had leaped over the row of benches and secured the fluttering victims which he thrust hurriedly into his pockets then he beckoned me with a dirty forefinger come on cully he said hoarsely you re in on the feed thank you very much weakly i followed my dingy acquaintance he led me away from the park down a side street and through a crack in a fence into a vacant lot where some excavating had been going on behind a pile of old stones and lumber he paused and took out his birds i got matches said he you got any paper to start a fire with i drew forth my manuscript story of the sparrows and offered it for burnt sacrifice there were old planks splinters and chips for our fire my frowsy friend produced from some interior of his frayed clothing half a loaf of bread pepper and salt in ten minutes each of us was holding a sparrow spitted upon a stick over the leaping flames say said my fellow bivouacker this ain t so bad when a fellow s hungry it reminds me of when i struck new york first about fifteen years ago i come in from the west to see if i could get a job on a newspaper i hit the madison square park the first mornin after and was sitting around on the benches i noticed the sparrows chirpin and the grass and trees so nice and green that i thought i was back in the country again then i got some papers out of my pocket and i know i interrupted you sent it to the sun and got say said my friend suspiciously you seem to know a good deal where was you i went to sleep on the bench there in the sun and somebody touched me for every cent i had hearts and hands at denver there was an influx of passengers into the coaches on the eastbound b m express in one coach there sat a very pretty young woman dressed in elegant taste and surrounded by all the luxurious comforts of an experienced traveler among the newcomers were two young men one of handsome presence with a bold frank countenance and manner the other a ruffled glum faced person heavily built and roughly dressed the two were handcuffed together as they passed down the aisle of the coach the only vacant seat offered was a reversed one facing the attractive young woman here the linked couple seated themselves the young woman s glance fell upon them with a distant swift disinterest then with a

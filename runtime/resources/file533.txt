in a side proposition now and then and at forty five was worth there now it s over hardly had time to yawn did you i ve seen biographies that but let us dissemble i want you to consider jacob spraggins esq after he had arrived at the seventh stage of his career the stages meant are first humble origin second deserved promotion third stockholder fourth capitalist fifth trust magnate sixth rich malefactor seventh caliph eighth x the eighth stage shall be left to the higher mathematics at fifty five jacob retired from active business the income of a czar was still rolling in on him from coal iron real estate oil railroads manufactories and corporations but none of it touched jacob s hands in a raw state it was a sterilized increment carefully cleaned and dusted and fumigated until it arrived at its ultimate stage of untainted spotless checks in the white fingers of his private secretary jacob built a three million dollar palace on a corner lot fronting on nabob avenue city of new bagdad and began to feel the mantle of the late h a rashid descending upon him eventually jacob slipped the mantle under his collar tied it in a neat four in hand and became a licensed harrier of our mesopotamian proletariat when a man s income becomes so large that the butcher actually sends him the kind of steak he orders he begins to think about his soul s salvation now the various stages or classes of rich men must not be forgotten the capitalist can tell you to a dollar the amount of his wealth the trust magnate estimates it the rich malefactor hands you a cigar and denies that he has bought the p d q the caliph merely smiles and talks about hammerstein and the musical lasses there is a record of tremendous altercation at breakfast in a where to dine well tavern between a magnate and his wife the rift within the loot being that the wife calculated their fortune at a figure higher than did her future divorc oh well i myself heard a similar quarrel between a man and his wife because he found fifty cents less in his pockets than he thought he had after all we are all human count tolstoi r fitzsimmons peter pan and the rest of us don t lose heart because the story seems to be degenerating into a sort of moral essay for intellectual readers there will be dialogue and stage business pretty soon when jacob first began to compare the eyes of needles with the camels in the zoo he decided upon organized charity he had his secretary send a check for one million to the universal benevolent association of the globe you may have looked down through a grating in front of a decayed warehouse for a nickel that you had dropped through but that is neither here nor there the association acknowledged receipt of his favor of the th ult with enclosure as stated separated by a double line but still mighty close to the matter under the caption of oddities of the day s news in an evening paper jacob spraggins read that one jasper spargyous had donated to the u b a of g a camel may have a stomach for each day in the week but i dare not venture to accord him whiskers for fear of the great displeasure at washington but if he have whiskers surely not one of them will seem to have been inserted in the eye of a needle by that effort of that rich man to enter the k of h the right is reserved to reject any and all bids signed s peter secretary and gatekeeper next jacob selected the best endowed college he could scare up and presented it with a laboratory the college did not maintain a scientific course but it accepted the money and built an elaborate lavatory instead which was no diversion of funds so far as jacob ever discovered the faculty met and invited jacob to come over and take his a b c degree before sending the invitation they smiled cut out the c added the proper punctuation marks and all was well while walking on the campus before being capped and gowned jacob saw two professors strolling nearby their voices long adapted to indoor acoustics undesignedly reached his ear there goes the latest chevalier d industrie said one of them to buy a sleeping powder from us he gets his degree to morrow in foro conscientai said the other let s eave arf a brick at im jacob ignored the latin but the brick pleasantry was not too hard for him there was no mandragora in the honorary draught of learning that he had bought that was before the passage of the pure food and drugs act jacob wearied of philanthropy on a large scale if i could see folks made happier he said to himself if i could see em myself and hear em express their gratitude for what i done for em it would make me feel better this donatin funds to institutions and societies is about as satisfactory as dropping money into a broken slot machine so jacob followed his nose which led him through unswept streets to the homes of the poorest the very thing said jacob i will charter two river steamboats pack them full of these unfortunate children and say ten thousand dolls and drums and a thousand freezers of ice cream and give them a delightful outing up the sound the sea breezes on that trip ought to blow the taint off some of this money that keeps coming in faster than i can work it off my mind jacob must have leaked some of his benevolent intentions for an immense person with a bald face and a mouth that looked as if it ought to have a drop letters here sign over it

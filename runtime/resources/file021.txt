plenty of money and don t mind spending it then this mother cary s chick of the desert sits down by me and we hold a conversationfest it seems that he was money poor he d lived in ranch camps all his life and he confessed to me that his supreme idea of luxury was to ride into camp tired out from a round up eat a peck of mexican beans hobble his brains with a pint of raw whisky and go to sleep with his boots for a pillow when this barge load of unexpected money came to him and his pink but perky partner george and they hied themselves to this clump of outhouses called atascosa city you know what happened to them they had money to buy anything they wanted but they didn t know what to want their ideas of spendthriftiness were limited to three whisky saddles and gold watches if there was anything else in the world to throw away fortunes on they had never heard about it so when they wanted to have a hot time they d ride into town and get a city directory and stand in front of the principal saloon and call up the population alphabetically for free drinks then they would order three or four new california saddles from the storekeeper and play crack loo on the sidewalk with twenty dollar gold pieces betting who could throw his gold watch the farthest was an inspiration of george s but even that was getting to be monotonous was i on to the opportunity listen in thirty minutes i had dashed off a word picture of metropolitan joys that made life in atascosa city look as dull as a trip to coney island with your own wife in ten minutes more we shook hands on an agreement that i was to act as his guide interpreter and friend in and to the aforesaid wassail and amenity and solomon mills which was his name was to pay all expenses for a month at the end of that time if i had made good as director general of the rowdy life he was to pay me one thousand dollars and then to clinch the bargain we called the roll of atascosa city and put all of its citizens except the ladies and minors under the table except one man named horace westervelt st clair just for that we bought a couple of hatfuls of cheap silver watches and egged him out of town with em we wound up by dragging the harness maker out of bed and setting him to work on three new saddles and then we went to sleep across the railroad track at the depot just to annoy the s a a p think of having seventy five thousand dollars and trying to avoid the disgrace of dying rich in a town like that the next day george who was married or something started back to the ranch me and solly as i now called him prepared to shake off our moth balls and wing our way against the arc lights of the joyous and tuneful east no way stops says i to solly except long enough to get you barbered and haberdashed this is no texas feet shampetter says i where you eat chili concarne con huevos and then holler whoopee across the plaza we re now going against the real high life we re going to mingle with the set that carries a spitz wears spats and hits the ground in high spots solly puts six thousand dollars in century bills in one pocket of his brown ducks and bills of lading for ten thousand dollars on eastern banks in another then i resume diplomatic relations with the s a a p and we hike in a northwesterly direction on our circuitous route to the spice gardens of the yankee orient we stopped in san antonio long enough for solly to buy some clothes and eight rounds of drinks for the guests and employees of the menger hotel and order four mexican saddles with silver trimmings and white angora suaderos to be shipped down to the ranch from there we made a big jump to st louis we got there in time for dinner and i put our thumb prints on the register of the most expensive hotel in the city now says i to solly with a wink at myself here s the first dinner station we ve struck where we can get a real good plate of beans and while he was up in his room trying to draw water out of the gas pipe i got one finger in the buttonhole of the head waiter s tuxedo drew him apart inserted a two dollar bill and closed him up again frankoyse says i i have a pal here for dinner that s been subsisting for years on cereals and short stogies you see the chef and order a dinner for us such as you serve to dave francis and the general passenger agent of the iron mountain when they eat here we ve got more than bernhardt s tent full of money and we want the nose bags crammed with all the chief deveries de cuisine object is no expense now show us at six o clock me and solly sat down to dinner spread there s nothing been seen like it since the cambon snack it was all served at once the chef called it dinnay a la poker it s a famous thing among the gormands of the west the dinner comes in threes of a kind there was guinea fowls guinea pigs and guinness s stout roast veal mock turtle soup and chicken pate shad roe caviar and tapioca canvas back duck canvas back ham and cotton tail rabbit philadelphia capon fried snails and sloe gin and so on in threes the idea was that you eat nearly all you can of

the english and the custom houses turned over to them as a guarantee the long enduring people had determined to make their protest felt on that night in coralio and in other towns their ire found vent veiling mobs mercurial but dangerous roamed the streets they overthrew the great bronze statue of the president that stood in the center of the plaza and hacked it to shapeless pieces they tore from public buildings the tablets set there proclaiming the glory of the illustrious liberator his pictures in the government offices were demolished the mobs even attacked the casa morena but were driven away by the military which remained faithful to the executive all the night terror reigned the greatness of losada was shown by the fact that by noon the next day order was restored and he was still absolute he issued proclamations denying positively that any negotiation of any kind had been entered into with england sir stafford vaughn the pink cheeked englishman also declared in placards and in public print that his presence there had no international significance he was a traveller without guile in fact so he stated he had not even spoken with the president or been in his presence since his arrival during this disturbance white was preparing for his homeward voyage in the steamship that was to sail within two or three days about noon keogh the restless took his camera out with the hope of speeding the lagging hours the town was now as quiet as if peace had never departed from her perch on the red tiled roofs about the middle of the afternoon keogh hurried back to the hotel with something decidedly special in his air he retired to the little room where he developed his pictures later on he came out to white on the balcony with a luminous grim predatory smile on his face do you know what that is he asked holding up a x photograph mounted on cardboard snap shot of a senorita sitting in the sand alliteration unintentional guessed white lazily wrong saidkeogh with shining eyes it s a slung shot it s a can of dynamite it s a gold mine it s a sight draft on your president man for twenty thousand dollars yes sir twenty thousand this time and no spoiling the picture no ethics of art in the way art you with your smelly little tubes i ve got you skinned to death with a kodak take a look at that white took the picture in his hand and gave a long whistle jove he exclaimed but wouldn t that stir up a row in town if you let it be seen how in the world did you get it billy you know that high wall around the president man s back garden i was up there trying to get a bird s eye of the town i happened to notice a chink in the wall where a stone and a lot of plaster had slid out thinks i i ll take a peep through to see how mr president s cabbages are growing the first thing i saw was him and this sir englishman sitting at a little table about twenty feet away they had the table all spread over with documents and they were hobnobbing over them as thick as two pirates twas a nice corner of the garden all private and shady with palms and orange trees and they had a pail of champagne set by handy in the grass i knew then was the time for me to make my big hit in art so i raised the machine up to the crack and pressed the button just as i did so them old boys shook hands on the deal you see they took that way in the picture keogh put on his coat and hat what are you going to do with it asked white me said keogh in a hurt tone why i m going to tie a pink ribbon to it and hang it on the what not of course i m surprised at you but while i m out you just try to figure out what ginger cake potentate would be most likely to want to buy this work of art for his private collection just to keep it out of circulation the sunset was reddening the tops of the coconut palms when billy keogh came back from casa morena he nodded to the artist s questioning gaze and lay down on a cot with his hands under the back of his head i saw him he paid the money like a little man they didn t want to let me in at first i told em it was important yes that president man is on the plenty able list he s got a beautiful business system about the way he uses his brains all i had to do was to hold up the photograph so he could see it and name the price he just smiled and walked over to a safe and got the cash twenty one thousand dollar brand new united states treasury notes he laid on the table like i d pay out a dollar and a quarter fine notes too they crackled with a sound like burning the brush off a ten acre lot let s try the feel of one said white curiously i never saw a thousand dollar bill keogh did not immediately respond carry he said in an absent minded way you think a heap of your art don t you more said white frankly than has been for the financial good of my self and my friends i thought you were a fool the other day went on keogh quietly and i m not sure now that you wasn t but if you was so am i i ve been in some funny deals carry but i ve always managed to scramble fair and match my brains and capital against the other fellow s but when it comes to well when you ve got the other fellow cinched and the screws on him and he s got to put up why it don t strike me as being a man s game they ve got a name for it you know it s confound you don t you understand a fellow feels it s some thing like that blamed art of yours he well i tore that photograph up and laid the pieces on that stack of money and shoved the whole business back across the table excuse me mr losada i said but i guess i ve made a mistake in the price you get the photo for nothing now carry you get out the pencil and we ll do some more figuring i d like to save enough out of our capital for you to have some fried sausages in your joint when you get back to new york xv dickey there is little consecutiveness along the spanish main things happen there intermittently even time seems hang his scythe daily on the branch of an orange tree while he takes a siesta and a cigarette after the ineffectual revolt against the administration of president losada the country settled again into quiet toleration of the abuses with which he had been charged in coralio old political enemies went arm in arm lightly eschewing for the time all differences of opinion the failure of the art expedition did not stretch the cat footed keogh upon his back the ups and downs of fortune made smooth travelling for his nimble steps his blue pencil stub was at work again before the smoke of the steamer on which white sailed had cleared away from the horizon he had but to speak a word to geddie to find his credit negotiable for whatever goods he wanted from the store of brannigan company on the same day on which white arrived in new york keogh at the rear of a train of five pack mules loaded with hardware and cutlery set his face toward the grim interior mountains there the indian tribes wash gold dust from the auriferous streams and when a market is brought to them trading is brisk and muy bueno in the cordilleras in coralio time folded his wings and paced wearily along his drowsy path they who had most cheered the torpid hours were gone clancy had sailed on a spanish barque for colon contemplating a cut across the isthmus and then a further voyage to end at callao where the fighting was said to be on geddie whose quiet and genial nature had once served to mitigate the frequent dull reaction of lotus eating was now a home man happy with his bright orchid paula and never even dreaming of or regretting the unsolved sealed and monogramed bottle whose contents now inconsiderable were held safely in the keeping of the sea well may the walrus most discerning and eclectic of beasts place sealing wax midway on his program of topics that fall pertinent and diverting upon the ear atwood was gone he of the hospitable back porch and ingenuous cunning doctor gregg with his trepanning story smoldering within him was a whiskered volcano always showing signs of imminent eruption and was not to be considered in the ranks of those who might contribute to the amelioration of ennui the new consul s note chimed with the sad sea waves and the violent tropical greens he had not a bar of scheherezade or of the round table in his lute goodwin was employed with large projects what time he was loosed from them found him at his home where he loved to be therefore it will be seen that there was a dearth of fellowship and entertainment among the foreign contingent of coralio and then dicky maloney dropped down from the clouds upon the town and amused it nobody knew where dicky maloney hailed from or how he reached coralio he appeared there one day and that was all he afterward said that he came on the fruit steamer thor but an inspection of the thor s passenger list of that date was found to be maloneyless curiosity however soon perished and dicky took his place among the odd fish cast up by the caribbean he was an active devil may care rollicking fellow with an engaging gray eye the most irresistible grin a rather dark or much sunburned complexion and a head of the fieriest red hair ever seen in that country speaking the spanish language as well as he spoke english and seeming always to have plenty of silver in his pockets it was not long before he was a welcome companion whithersoever he went he had an extreme fondness for vino blanco and gained the reputation of being able to drink more of it than any three men in town everybody called him dicky everybody cheered up at the sight of him especially the natives to whom his marvellous red hair and his free and easy style were a constant delight and envy wherever you went in the town you would soon see dicky or hear his genial laugh and find around him a group of admirers who appreciated him both for his good nature and the white wine he was always so ready to buy a considerable amount of speculation was had concerning the object of his sojourn there until one day he silenced this by opening a small shop for the sale of tobacco dulces and the handiwork of the interior indians fibre and silk woven goods deerskin zapatos and basketwork of tule reeds even then he did not change his habits for he was drinking and playing cards half the day and night with the comandante the collector of customs the jefe politico and other gay dogs among the native officials one day dicky saw pasa the daughter of madama ortiz sitting in the side door of the hotel de los extranjeros he stopped in his tracks still for the first time in coralio and then he sped swift as a deer to find vasquez a gilded native youth to present him the young men had named pasa la santita naranjadita naranjadita is a spanish word for a certain color that you must go to more trouble to describe in english by saying the little saint tinted the most beautiful delicate slightly orange golden you will approximate the description of madama ortiz s daughter la madama ortiz sold rum in addition to other liquors now you must know that the rum expiates whatever opprobrium attends upon the other commodities for rum making mind you is a government monopoly and to keep a government dispensary assures respectability if not preeminence moreover the saddest of precisians could find no fault with the conduct of the shop customers drank there in the lowest of spirits and fearsomely as in the shadow of the dead for madama s ancient and vaunted lineage counteracted even the rum s behest to be merry for was she not of the iglesias who landed with pizarro and had not her deceased husband been comisionado de caminos y puentes for the district in the evenings pasa sat by the window in the room next to the one where they drank and strummed dreamily upon her guitar and then by twos and threes would come visiting young caballeros and occupy the prim line of chairs set against the wall of this room they were there to besiege the heart of la santita their method which is not proof against intelligent competition consisted of expanding the chest looking valorous and consuming a gross or two of cigarettes even saints delicately oranged prefer to be wooed differently dona pasa would tide over the vast chasms of nicotinized silence with music from her guitar while she wondered if the romances she had read about gallant and more more contiguous cavaliers were all lies at somewhat regular intervals madama would glide in from the dispensary with a sort of drought suggesting gleam in her eye and there would be a rustling of stiffly starched white trousers as one of the caballeros would propose an adjournment to the bar that dicky maloney would sooner or later explore this field was a thing to be foreseen there were few doors in coralio into which his red head had not been poked in an incredibly short space of time after his first sight of her he was there seated close beside her rocking chair there was no back against the wall poses in dicky s theory of wooing his plan of subjection was an attack at close range to carry the fortress with one concentrated ardent eloquent irresistible escalade that was dicky s way pasa was descended from the proudest spanish families in the country moreover she had had unusual advantages two years in a new orleans school had elevated her ambitions and fitted her for a fate above the ordinary maidens of her native land and yet here she succumbed to the first red haired scamp with a glib tongue and a charming smile that came along and courted her properly very soon dicky took her to the little church on the corner of the plaza and mrs maloney was added to her string of distinguished names and it was her fate to sit with her patient saintly eyes and figure like a bisque psyche behind the sequestered counter of the little shop while dicky drank and philandered with is frivolous acquaintances the women with their naturally fine instinct saw a chance for vivisection and delicately taunted her with his habits she turned upon them in a beautiful steady blaze of sorrowful contempt you meat cows she said in her level crystal clear tones you know nothing of a man your men are maromeros they are fit only to roll cigarettes in the shade until the sun strikes and shrivels them up they drone in your hammocks and you comb their hair and feed them with fresh fruit my man is of no such blood let him drink of the wine when he has taken sufficient of it to drown one of your flaccitos he will come home to me more of a man than one thousand of your pobrecitos my hair he smooths and braids to me he sings he himself removes my zapatos and there there upon each instep leaves a kiss he holds oh you will never understand blind ones who have never known a man sometimes mysterious things happened at night about dicky s shop while the front of it was dark in the little room back of it dicky and a few of his friends would sit about a table carrying on some kind of very quiet negocios until quite late finally he would let them out the front door very carefully and go upstairs to his little saint these visitors were generally conspirator like men with dark clothes and hats of course these dark things were noticed after a while and talked about dicky seemed to care nothing at all for the society of the alien residents of the town he avoided goodwin and his skilful escape from the trepanning story of doctor gregg is still referred to in coralio as a masterpiece of lightning diplomacy many letters arrived addressed to mr dicky maloney or senor dickee maloney to the considerable pride of pasa that so many people should desire to write to him only confirmed her own suspicion that the light from his red head shone around the world as to their contents she never felt curiosity there was a wife to you the one mistake dicky made in coralio was to run out of money at the wrong time where his money came from was a puzzle for the sales of his shop were next to nothing but that source failed and at a peculiarly unfortunate time it was when the comandante don senor el coronel encarnacion rios looked upon the little saint seated in the shop and felt his heart go pitapat the comandante who was versed in all the intricate art of gallantry first delicately hinted at his sentiments by donning his dress uniform and strutting up and down fiercely before her window pasa glancing demurely with her saintly eyes instantly perceived his resemblance to her parrot chichi and was diverted to the extent of smile the comandante saw the smile which was not intended for him convinced of an impression made he entered the shop confidently and advanced to open compliment pasa froze he pranced she flamed royally he was charmed to injudicious persistence she commanded him to leave the shop he tried to capture her hand and dicky entered smiling broadly full of white wine and the devil he spent five minutes in punishing the comandante scientifically and carefully so that the pain might be prolonged as far as possible at the end of that time he pitched the rash wooer out the door upon the stones of the street senseless a barefooted policeman who had been watching the affair from across the street blew a whistle a squad of four soldiers came running from the cuartel around the corner when they saw that the offender was dicky they stopped and blew more whistles which brought out reinforcements of eight deeming the odds against them sufficiently reduced the military advanced upon the disturber dicky being thoroughly imbued with the martial spirit stooped and drew the comandante s sword which was girded about him and charged his foe he chased the standing army four squares playfully prodding its squealing rear and hacking at its ginger colored heels but he was not so successful with the civic authorities six muscular nimble policemen overpowered him and conveyed him triumphantly but warily to jail el diablo colorado they dubbed him and derided the military for its defeat dicky with the rest of the prisoners could look out through the barred door at the grass of the little plaza at a row of orange trees and the red tile roofs and dobe walls of a line of insignificant stores at sunset along a path across this plaza came a melancholy procession of sad faced women bearing plantains cassava bread and fruit each coming with food to some wretch behind those bars to whom she still clung and furnished the means of life twice a day morning and evening they were permitted to come water was furnished to her compulsory guests by the republic but no food that evening dicky s name was called by the sentry and he stepped before the bars of the door there stood his little saint a black mantilla draped about her head and shoulders her face like glorified melancholy her clear eyes gazing longingly at him as if they might draw him between the bars to her she brought a chicken some oranges dulces and a loaf of white bread a soldier inspected the food and passed it in to dicky pasa spoke calmly as she always did briefly in her thrilling flute like tones angel of my life she said let it not be long that thou art away from me thou knowest that life is not a thing to be endured with thou not at my side tell me if i can do aught in this matter if not i will wait a little while i come again in the morning dicky with his shoes removed so as not to disturb his fellow prisoners tramped the floor of the jail half the night condemning his lack of money and the cause of it whatever that might have been he knew very well that money would have brought his release at once for two days succeeding pasa came at the appointed times and brought him food he eagerly inquired each time if a letter or package had come for him and she mournfully shook her head on the morning of the third day she brought only a small loaf of bread there were dark circles under her eyes she seemed as calm as ever by jingo said dicky who seemed to speak in english or spanish as the whim seized him this is dry provender muchachita is this the best you can dig up for a fellow pasa looked at him as a mother looks at a beloved but capricious babe think better of it she said in a low voice since for the next meal there will be nothing the last centavo is spent she pressed closer against the grating sell the goods in the shop take anything for them have i not tried did i not offer them for one tenth their cost not even one peso would any one give there is not one real in this town to assist dickee malonee dick clenched his teeth grimly that s the comandante he growled he s responsible for that sentiment wait oh wait till the cards are all out pasa lowered her voice to almost a whisper and listen heart of my heart she said i have endeavored to be brave but i cannot live without thee three days now dicky caught a faint gleam of steel from the folds of her mantilla for once she looked in his face and saw it without a smile stern menacing and purposeful then he suddenly raised his hand and his smile came back like a gleam of sunshine the hoarse signal of an incoming steamer s siren sounded in the harbor dicky called to the sentry who was pacing before the door what steamer comes the catarina of the vesuvius line without doubt of that line go you picarilla said dicky joyously to pasa to the american consul tell him i wish to speak with him see that he comes at once and look you let me see a different look in those eyes for i promise your head shall rest upon this arm tonight it was an hour before the consul came he held his green umbrella under his arm and mopped his forehead impatiently now see here maloney he began captiously you fellows seem to think you can cut up any kind of row and expect me to pull you out of it i m neither the war department nor a gold mine this country has its laws you know and there s one against pounding the senses out of the regular army you irish are forever getting into trouble i don t see what i can do anything like tobacco now to make you comfortable or newspapers son of eli interrupted dicky gravely you haven t changed an iota that is almost a duplicate of the speech you made when old koen s donkeys and geese got into the chapel loft and the culprits wanted to hide in your room oh heavens exclaimed the consul hurriedly adjusting his spectacles are you a yale man too were you in that crowd i don t seem to remember any one with red any one named maloney such a lot of college men seem to have misused their advantages one of the best mathematicians of the class of is selling lottery tickets in belize a cornell man dropped off here last month he was second steward on a guano boat i ll write to the department if you like maloney or if there s any tobacco or newspa there s nothing interrupted dicky shortly but this you go tell the captain of the catarina that dicky maloney wants to see him as soon as he can conveniently come tell him where i am hurry that s all the consul glad to be let off so easily hurried away the captain of the catarina a stout man sicilian born soon appeared shoving with little ceremony through the guards to the jail door the vesuvius fruit company had a habit of doing things that way in anchuria i am exceeding sorry exceeding sorry said the captain to see this occur i place myself at your service mr maloney what you need shall be furnished whatever you say shall be done dicky looked at him unsmilingly his red hair could not detract from his attitude of severe dignity as he stood tall and calm with his now grim mouth forming a horizontal line captain de lucco i believe i still have funds in the hands of your company ample and personal funds i ordered a remittance last week the money has not arrived you know what is needed in this game money and money and more money why has it not been sent by the cristobal replied de lucco gesticulating it was despatched where is the cristobal off cape antonio i spoke her with a broken shaft a tramp coaster was towing her back to new orleans i brought money ashore thinking your need for it might not withstand delay in this envelope is one thousand dollars there is more if you need it mr maloney for the present it will suffice said dicky softening as he crinkled the envelope and looked down at the half inch thickness of smooth dingy bills the long green he said gently with a new reverence in his gaze is there anything it will not buy captain i had three friends replied de lucco who was a bit of a philosopher who had money one of them speculated in stocks and made ten million another is in heaven and the third married a poor girl whom he loved the answer then said dicky is held by the almighty wall street and cupid so the question remains this queried the captain including dicky s surroundings in a significant gesture of his hand is it it is notiit is not connected with the business of your little shop there is no failure in your plans no no said dicky this is merely the result of a little private affair of mine a digression from the regular line of business they say for a complete life a man must know poverty love and war but they don t go well together capitan mio no there is no failure in my business the little shop is doing very well when the captain had departed dicky called the sergeant of the jail squad and asked am i preso by the military or by the civil authority surely there is no martial law in effect now senor bueno now go or send to the alcalde the juez de la paz and the jefe de los policios tell them i am prepared at once to satisfy the demands of justice a folded bill of the long green slid into the sergeant s hand then dicky s smile came back again for he knew that the hours of his captivity were numbered and he hummed in time with the sentry s tread they re hanging men and women now for lacking of the green so that night dicky sat by the window of the room over his shop an his little saint sat close by working at something silken and dainty dicky was thoughtful and grave his red hair was in an unusual state of disorder pasa s fingers often ached to smooth and arrange it but dicky would never allow it he was poring tonight over a great litter of maps and books and papers on his table until that perpendicular line came between his brows that always distressed pasa presently she went and brought his hat and stood with it until he looked up inquiringly it is sad for you here she explained go out and drink vino blanco come back when you get that smile you used to wear that is what i wish to see dicky laughed and threw down his papers the vino blanco stage is past it has served its turn perhaps after all there was less entered my mouth and more my ears than people thought but there will be no more maps or frowns tonight i promise you that come they sat upon a reed silleta at the window and watched the quivering gleams from the lights of the catarina reflected in the harbor presently pasa rippled out one of her infrequent chirrups of audible laughter i was thinking she began anticipating dicky s question of the foolish things girls have in their minds because i went to school in the states i used to have ambitions nothing less than to be the president s wife would satisfy me and look thou red picaroon to what obscure fate thou hast stolen me don t give up hope said dicky smiling more than one irishman has been the ruler of a south american country there was a dictator of chili named o higgins why not a president maloney of anchuria say the word santita mia and we ll make the race no no no thou red haired reckless one sighed pasa i am content she laid her head against his arm here xvi rouge et noir it has been indicated that disaffection followed the elevation of losada to the presidency this feeling continued to grow throughout the entire republic there seemed to be a spirit of silent sullen discontent even the old liberal party to which goodwin zavalla and other patriots had lent their aid was disappointed losada had failed to become a popular idol fresh taxes fresh import duties and more than all his tolerance of the outrageous oppression of citizens by the military had rendered him the most obnoxious president since the despicable alforan the majority of his own cabinet were out of sympathy with him the army which he had courted by giving it license to tyrannize had been his main and thus far adequate support but the most impolitic of the administration s moves had been when it antagonized the vesuvius fruit company an organization plying twelve steamers with a cash capital somewhat larger than anchuria s surplus and debt combined reasonably an established concern like the vesuvius would become irritated at having a small retail republic with no rating at all attempt to squeeze it so when the government proxies applied for a subsidy they encountered a polite refusal the president at once retaliated by clapping an export duty of one real per bunch on bananas a thing unprecedented in fruit growing countries the vesuvius company had invested large sums in wharves and plantations along the anchurian coast their agents had erected fine homes in the towns where they had their headquarters and heretofore had worked with the republic in good will and with advantage to both it would lose an immense sum if compelled to move out the selling price of bananas from vera cruz to trinidad was three reales per bunch this new duty of one real would have ruined the fruit growers in anchuria and have seriously discommoded the vesuvius company had it declined to pay it but for some reason the vesuvius continued to buy anchurian fruit paying four reals for it and not suffering the growers to bear the loss this apparent victory deceived his excellency and he began to hunger for more of it he sent an emissary to request a conference with a representative of the fruit company the vesuvius sent mr franzoni a little stout cheerful man always cool and whistling airs from verdi s operas senor espirition of the office of the minister of finance attempted the sandbagging in behalf of anchuria the meeting took place in the cabin of the salvador of the vesuvius line senor espirition opened negotiations by announcing that the government contemplated the building of a railroad to skirt the alluvial coast lands after touching upon the benefits such a road would confer upon the interests of the vesuvius he reached the definite suggestion that a contribution to the road s expenses of say fifty thousand pesos would not be more than an equivalent to benefits received mr franzoni denied that his company would receive any benefits from a contemplated road as its representative he must decline to contribute fifty thousand pesos but he would assume the responsibility of offering twenty five did senor espirition understand senor franzoni to mean twenty five thousand pesos by no means twenty five pesos and in silver not in gold your offer insults my government cried senor espirition rising with indignation then said mr franzoni in warning tone we will change it the offer was never changed could mr franzoni have meant the government this was the state of affairs in anchuria when the winter season opened at coralio at the end of the second year of losada s administration so when the government and society made its annual exodus to the seashore it was evident that the presidential advent would not be celebrated by unlimited rejoicing the tenth of november was the day set for the entrance into coralio of the gay company from the capital a narrow gauge railroad runs twenty miles into the interior from solitas the government party travels by carriage from san mateo to this road s terminal point and proceeds by train to solitas from here they march in grand procession to coralio where on the day of their coming festivities and ceremonies abound but this season saw an ominous dawning of the tenth of november although the rainy season was over the day seemed to hark back to reeking june a fine drizzle of rain fell all during the forenoon the procession entered coralio amid a strange silence president losada was an elderly man grizzly bearded with a considerable ratio of indian blood revealed in his cinnamon complexion his carriage headed the procession surrounded and guarded by captain cruz and his famous troop of one hundred light horse el ciento huilando colonel rocas followed with a regiment of the regular army the president s sharp beady eyes glanced about him for the expected demonstration of welcome but he faced a stolid indifferent array of citizens sightseers the anchurians are by birth and habit and they turned out to their last able bodied unit to witness the scene but they maintained an accusive silence they crowded the streets to the very wheel ruts they covered the red tile roofs to the eaves but there was never a viva from them no wreaths of palm and lemon branches or gorgeous strings of paper roses hung from the windows and balconies as was the custom there was an apathy a dull dissenting disapprobation that was the more ominous because it puzzled no one feared an outburst a revolt of the discontents for they had no leader the president and those loyal to him had never even heard whispered a name among them capable of crystallizing the dissatisfaction into opposition no there could be no danger the people always procured a new idol before they destroyed an old one at length after a prodigious galloping and curvetting of red sashed majors gold laced colonels and epauletted generals the procession formed for its annual progress down the calle grande to the casa morena where the ceremony of welcome to the visiting president always took place the swiss band led the line of march after it pranced the local comandante mounted and a detachment of his troops next came a carriage with four members of the cabinet conspicuous among them the minister of war old general pilar with his white moustache and his soldierly bearing then the president s vehicle containing also the ministers of finance and state and surrounded by captain cruz s light horse formed in a close double file of fours following them the rest of the officials of state the judges and distinguished military and social ornaments of public and private life as the band struck up and the movement began like a bird of ill omen the valhalla the swiftest steamship of the vesuvius line glided into the harbor in plain view of the president and his train of course there was nothing menacing about its arrival a business firm does not go to war with a nation but it reminded senor espirition and others in those carriages that the vesuvius fruit company was undoubtedly carrying something up its sleeve for them by the time the van of the procession had reached the government building captain cronin of the valhalla and mr vincenti member of the vesuvius company had landed and were pushing their way bluff hearty and nonchalant through the crowd on the narrow sidewalk clad in white linen big debonair with an air of good humored authority they made conspicuous figures among the dark mass of unimposing anchurians as they penetrated to within a few yards of the steps of the casa morena looking easily above the heads of the crowd they perceived another that towered above the undersized natives it was the fiery poll of dicky maloney against the wall close by the lower step and his broad seductive grin showed that he recognized their presence dicky had attired himself becomingly for the festive occasion in a well fitting black suit pasa was close by his side her head covered with the ubiquitous black mantilla mr vincenti looked at her attentively botticelli s madonna he remarked gravely i wonder when she got into the game i don t like his getting tangled with the women i hoped he would keep away from them captain cronin s laugh almost drew attention from the parade with that head of hair keep away from the women and a maloney hasn t he got a license but nonsense aside what do you think of the prospects it s a species of filibustering out of my line vincenti glanced again at dicky s head and smiled rouge et noir he said there you have it make your play gentlemen our money is on the red the lad s game said cronin with a commending look at the tall easy figure by the steps but tis all like fly by night theatricals to me the talk s bigger than the stage there s a smell of gasoline in the air and they re their own audience and scene shifters they ceased talking for general pilar had descended from the first carriage and had taken his stand upon the top step of casa morena as the oldest member of the cabinet custom had decreed that he should make the address of welcome presenting the keys of the official residence to the president at its close general pilar was one of the most distinguished citizens of the republic hero of three wars and innumerable revolutions he was an honored guest at european courts and camps an eloquent speaker and a friend to the people he represented the highest type of the anchurians holding in his hand the gilt keys of casa morena he began his address in a historical form touching upon each administration and the advance of civilization and prosperity from the first dim striving after liberty down to present times arriving at the regime of president losada at which point according to precedent he should have delivered a eulogy upon its wise conduct and the happiness of the people general pilar paused then he silently held up the bunch of keys high above his head with his eyes closely regarding it the ribbon with which they were bound fluttered in the breeze it still blows cried the speaker exultantly citizens of anchuria give thanks to the saints this night that our air is still free thus disposing of losada s administration he abruptly reverted to that of olivarra anchuria s most popular ruler olivarra had been assassinated nine years before while in the prime of life and usefulness a faction of the liberal party led by losada himself had been accused of the deed whether guilty or not it was eight years before the ambitious and scheming losada had gained his goal upon this theme general pilar s eloquence was loosed he drew the picture of the beneficent olivarra with a loving hand he reminded the people of the peace the security and the happiness they had enjoyed during that period he recalled in vivid detail and with significant contrast the last winter sojourn of president olivarra in coralio when his appearance at their fiestas was the signal for thundering vivas of love and approbation the first public expression of sentiment from the people that day followed a low sustained murmur went among them like the surf rolling along the shore ten dollars to a dinner at the saint charles remarked mr vincenti that rouge wins i never bet against my own interests said captain cronin lighting a cigar long winded old boy for his age what s he talking about my spanish replied vincenti runs about ten words to the minute his is something around two hundred whatever he s saying he s getting them warmed up friends and brothers general pilar was saying could i reach out my hand this day across the lamentable silence of the grave to olivarra the good to the ruler who was one of you whose tears fell when you sorrowed and whose smile followed your joy i would bring him back to you but olivarra is dead dead at the hands of a craven assassin the speaker turned and gazed boldly into the carriage of the president his arm remained extended aloft as if to sustain his peroration the president was listening aghast at this remarkable address of welcome he was sunk back upon his seat trembling with rage and dumb surprise his dark hands tightly gripping the carriage cushions half rising he extended one arm toward the speaker and shouted a harsh command at captain cruz the leader of the flying hundred sat his horse immovable with folded arms giving no sign of having heard losada sank back again his dark features distinctly paling who says that olivarra is dead suddenly cried the speaker his voice old as he was sounding like a battle trumpet his body lies in the grave but to the people he loved he has bequeathed his spirit yes more his learning his courage his kindness yes more his youth his image people of anchuria have you forgotten ramon the son of olivarra cronin and vincenti watching closely saw dicky maloney suddenly raise his hat tear off his shock of red hair leap up the steps and stand at the side of general pilar the minister of war laid his arm across the young man s shoulders all who had known president olivarra saw again his same lion like pose the same frank undaunted expression the same high forehead with the peculiar line of the clustering crisp black hair general pilar was an experienced orator he seized the moment of breathless silence that preceded the storm citizens of anchuria he trumpeted holding aloft the keys of casa morena i am here to deliver these keys the keys to your homes and liberty to your chosen president shall i deliver them to enrico olivarra s assassin or to his son olivarra olivarra the crowd shrieked and howled all vociferated the magic name men women children and the parrots and the enthusiasm was not confined to the blood of the plebs colonel rocas ascended the steps and laid his sword theatrically at young ramon olivarra s feet four members of the cabinet embraced him captain cruz gave a command and twenty of el ciento huilando dismounted and arranged themselves in a cordon about the steps of casa morena but ramon olivarra seized that moment to prove himself a born genius and politician he waved those soldiers aside and descended the steps to the street there without losing his dignity or the distinguished elegance that the loss of his red hair brought him betook the proletariat to his bosom the barefooted the dirty indians caribs babies beggars old young saints soldiers and sinners he missed none of them while this act of the drama was being presented the scene shifters had been busy at the duties that had been assigned to them two of cruz s dragoons had seized the bridle reins of losada s horses others formed a close guard around the carriage and they galloped off with the tyrant and his two unpopular ministers no doubt a place had been prepared for them there are a number of well barred stone apartments in coralio rouge wins said mr vincenti calmly lighting another cigar captain cronin had been intently watching the vicinity of the stone steps for some time good boy he exclaimed suddenly as if relieved i wondered if he was going to forget his kathleen mavourneen young olivarra had reascended the steps and spoken a few words to general pilar then that distinguished veteran descended to the ground and approached pasa who still stood wonder eyed where dicky had left her with his plumed hat in his hand and his medals and decorations shining on his breast the general spoke to her and gave her his arm and they went up the stone steps of the casa morena together and then ramon olivarra stepped forward and took both her hands before all the people and while the cheering was breaking out afresh everywhere captain cronin and mr vincenti turned and walked back toward the shore where the gig was waiting for them there ll be another presidente proclamada in the morning said mr vincenti musingly as a rule they are not as reliable as the elected ones but this youngster seems to have some good stuff in him he planned and maneuvered the entire campaign olivarra s widow you know was wealthy after her husband was assassinated she went to the states and educated her son at yale the vesuvius company hunted him up and backed him in the little game it s a glorious thing said cronin half jestingly to be able to discharge a government and insert one of your own choosing in these days oh it is only amatter of business said vincenti stopping and offering the stump of his cigar to a monkey that swung down from a lime tree and that is what moves the world of today that extra real on the price of bananas had to go we took the shortest way of removing it xvii two recalls there remains three duties to be performed before the curtain falls upon the patched comedy two have been promised the third is no less obligatory it was set forth in the program of this tropic vaudeville that it would be made known why shorty day of the columbia detective agency lost his position also that smith should come again to tell us what mystery he followed that night on the shores of anchuria when he strewed so many cigar stumps around the coconut palm during his lonely night vigil on the beach these things were promised but a bigger thing yet remains to be accomplished the clearing up of a seeming wrong that has been done according to the array of chronicled facts truthfully set forth that have been presented and one voice speaking shall do these three things two men sat on a stringer of a north river pier in the city of new york a steamer from the tropics had begun to unload bananas and oranges on the pier now and then a banana or two would fall from an overripe bunch and one of the two men would shamble forward seize the fruit and return to share it with his companion one of the men was in the ultimate stage of deterioration as far as rain and wind and sun could wreck the garments he wore it had been done in his person the ravages of drink were as plainly visible and yet upon his high bridged rubicund nose was jauntily perched a pair of shining and flawless gold rimmed glasses the other man was not so far gone upon the descending highway of the incompetents truly the flower of his manhood had gone to seed seed that perhaps no soil might sprout but there were still cross cuts along where he travelled through which he might yet regain the pathway of usefulness without disturbing the slumbering miracles this man was short and compactly built he had an oblique dead eye like that of a sting ray and the moustache of a cocktail mixer we know the eye and the moustache we know that smith of the luxurious yacht the gorgeous raiment the mysterious mission the magic disappearance has come again though shorn of the accessories of his former state at his third banana the man with the nose glasses spat it from him with a shudder deuce take all fruit he remarked in a patrician tone of disgust i lived for two years where these things grow the memory of their taste lingers with you the oranges are not so bad just see if you can gather a couple of them o day when the next broken crate comes up did you live down with the monkeys asked the other made tepidly garrulous by the sunshine and the alleviating meal of juicy fruit i was down there once myself but only for a few hours that was when i was with the columbia detective agency the monkey people did me up i d have my job yet if it hadn t been for them i ll tell you about it one day the chief sent a note around to the office that read send o day here at once for a big piece of business i was the crack detective of the agency at that time they always handed me the big jobs the address the chief wrote from was down in the wall street district when i got there i found him in a private office with a lot of directors who were looking pretty fuzzy they stated the case the president of the republic insurance company had skipped with about a tenth of a million dollars in cash the directors wanted him back pretty bad but they wanted the money worse they said they needed it they had traced the old gent s movements to where he boarded a tramp fruit steamer bound for south america that same morning with his daughter and a big gripsack all the family he had one of the directors had his steam yacht coaled and with steam up ready for a trip and he turned her over to me cart blongsh in four hours i was on board of her and hot on the trail of the fruit tub i had a pretty good idea where old wahrfield that was his name j churchill wahrfield would head for at that time we had a treaty with about every foreign country except belgium and that banana republic anchuria there wasn t a photo of old wahrfield to be had in new york he had been foxy there but i had his description and besides the lady with him would be a dead give away anywhere she was one of the high flyers in society not the kind that have their pictures in the sunday papers but the real sort that open chrysanthemum shows and christen battleships well sir we never got a sight of that fruit tub on the road the ocean is a pretty big place and i guess we took different paths across it but we kept going toward this anchuria where the fruiter was bound for we struck the monkey coast one afternoon about four there was a ratty looking steamer off shore taking on bananas the monkeys were loading her up with big barges it might be the one the old man had taken and it might not i went ashore to look around the scenery was pretty good i never saw any finer on the new york stage i struck an american on shore a big cool chap standing around with the monkeys he showed me the consul s office the consul was a nice young fellow he said the fruiter was the karlsefin running generally to new orleans but took her last cargo to new york then i was sure my people were on board although everybody told me that no passengers had landed i didn t think they would land until after dark for they might have been shy about it on account of seeing that yacht of mine hanging around so all i had to do was to wait and nab em when they came ashore i couldn t arrest old wahrfield without extradition papers but my play was to get the cash they generally give up if you strike em when they re tired and rattled and short on nerve after dark i sat under a coconut tree on the beach for a while and then i walked around and investigated that town some and it was enough to give you the lions if a man could stay in new york and be honest he d better do it than to hit that monkey town with a million dinky little mud houses grass over your shoe tops in the streets ladies in low neck and short sleeves walking around smoking cigars tree frogs rattling like a hose cart going to a ten blow big mountains dropping gravel in the back yards and the sea licking the paint off in front no sir a man had better be in god s country living on free lunch than there the main street ran along the beach and i walked down it and then turned up a kind of lane where the houses were made of poles and straw i wanted to see what the monkeys did when they weren t climbing coconut trees the very first shack i looked in i saw my people they must have come ashore while i was promenading a man about fifty smooth face heavy eyebrows dressed in black broadcloth looking like he was just about to say can any little boy in the sunday school answer that he was freezing on to a grip that weighed like a dozen gold bricks and a swell girl a regular peach with a fifth avenue cut was sitting on a wooden chair an old black woman was fixing some coffee and beans on a table the light they had come from a lantern hung on a nail i went and stood in the door and they looked at me and i said mr wahrfield you are my prisoner i hope for the lady s sake you will take the matter sensibly you know why i want you who are you says the old gent o day says i of the columbia detective agency and now sir let me give you a piece of good advice you go back and take your medicine like a man hand em back the boodle and maybe they ll let you off light go back easy and i ll put in a word for you i ll give you five minutes to decide i pulled out my watch and waited then the young lady chipped in she was one of the genuine high steppers you could tell by the way her clothes fit and the style she had that fifth avenue was made for her come inside she says don t stand in the door and disturb the whole street with that suit of clothes now what is it you want three minutes gone i said i ll tell you again while the other two tick off you ll admit being the president of the republic won t you i am says he well then says i it ought to be plain to you wanted in new york j churchill wahrfield president of the republic insurance company also the funds belonging to said company now in that grip in the unlawful possession of said j churchill wahrfield oh h h h says the young lady as if she was thinking you want to take us back to new york to take mr wahrfield there s no charge against you miss there ll be no objection of course to your returning with your father of a sudden the girl gave a tiny scream and grabbed the old boy around the neck oh father father she says kind of contralto can this be true have you taken money that is not yours speak father it made you shiver to hear the tremolo stop she put on her voice the old boy looked pretty bughouse when she first grappled him but she went on whispering in his ear and patting his offshoulder till he stood still but sweating a little she got him to one side and they talked together a minute and then he put on some gold eyeglasses and walked up and handed me the grip mr detective he says talking a little broken i conclude to return with you i have finished to discover that life on this desolate and displeased coast would be worse than to die itself i will go back and hurl myself upon the mercy of the republic company have you brought a sheep sheep says i i haven t a single ship cut in the young lady don t get funny father is of german birth and doesn t speak perfect english how did you come up the girl was all broke up she had a handkerchief to her face and kept saying every little bit h father father she walked up to me and laid her lily white hand on the clothes that

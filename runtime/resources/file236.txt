and wagon for a week we ll rustle up the stake by then this hair tonic ll sell right along over in jersey bald heads ain t popular over there on account of the mosquitoes directly i dragged out my

opening up in the hackensack low grounds what s hair anyway if you have to shake it off we pasted on the chill cure labels about half an hour and buck says making an honest livin s better than that wall street anyhow ain t it pick you bet says i hostages to momus i i never got inside of the legitimate line of graft but once but one time as i say i reversed the decision of the revised statutes and undertook a thing that i d have to apologize for even under the new jersey trust laws me and caligula polk of muskogee in the creek nation was down in the mexican state of tamaulipas running a peripatetic lottery and monte game now selling lottery tickets is a government graft in mexico just like selling forty eight cents worth of postage stamps for forty nine cents is over here so uncle porfirio he instructs the rurales to attend to our case rurales they re a sort of country police but don t draw any mental crayon portraits of the worthy constables with a tin star and a gray goatee the rurales well if we d mount our supreme court on broncos arm em with winchesters and start em out after john doe et al we d have about the same thing when the rurales started for us we started for the states they chased us as far as matamoras we hid in a brickyard and that night we swum the rio grande caligula with a brick in each hand absent minded which he drops upon the soil of texas forgetting he had em from there we emigrated to san antone and then over to new orleans where we took a rest and in that town of cotton bales and other adjuncts to female beauty we made the acquaintance of drinks invented by the creoles during the period of louey cans in which they are still served at the side doors the most i can remember of this town is that me and caligula and a frenchman named mccarty wait a minute adolph mccarty was trying to make the french quarter pay up the back trading stamps due on the louisiana purchase when somebody hollers that the johndarms are coming i have an insufficient recollection of buying two yellow tickets through a window and i seemed to see a man swing a lantern and say all aboard i remembered no more except that the train butcher was covering me and caligula up with augusta j evans s works and figs when we become revised we find that we have collided up against the state of georgia at a spot hitherto unaccounted for in time tables except by an asterisk which means that trains stop every other thursday on signal by tearing up a rail we was waked up in a yellow pine hotel by the noise of flowers and the smell of birds yes sir for the wind was banging sunflowers as big as buggy wheels against the weatherboarding and the chicken coop was right under the window me and caligula dressed and went down stairs the landlord was shelling peas on the front porch he was six feet of chills and fever and hongkong in complexion though in other respects he seemed amenable in the exercise of his sentiments and features caligula who

we know the reason we are where but can t exactly figure out on account of at what place well gentlemen says the landlord i reckoned you all would be inquiring this morning you all dropped off of the nine thirty train here last night and you was right tight yes you was right smart in liquor i can inform you that you are now in the town of mountain valley in the state of georgia on top of that says caligula don t say that we can t have anything to eat sit down gentlemen says the landlord and in twenty minutes i ll call you to the best breakfast you can get anywhere in town that breakfast turned out to be composed of fried bacon and a yellowish edifice that proved up something between pound cake and flexible sandstone the landlord calls it corn pone and then he sets out a dish of the exaggerated breakfast food known as hominy and so me and caligula makes the acquaintance of the celebrated food that enabled every johnny reb to lick one and two thirds yankees for nearly four years at a stretch the wonder to me is says caligula that uncle robert lee s boys didn t chase the grant and sherman outfit clear up into hudson s bay it would have made me that mad to eat this truck they call mahogany hog and hominy i explains is the staple food of this section then says caligula they ought to keep it where it belongs i thought this was a hotel and not a stable now if we was in

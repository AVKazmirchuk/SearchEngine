is to be a minstrel show next wednesday for benefit of austin grays i attended the rehearsal last night but am better this morning and the doctor thinks i will pull through with careful attention the jokes are mostly mildewed rockribbed and ancient as the sun i can give you no better idea of the tout ensemble and sine die of the affair than to state that scuddy is going to sing a song mrs harrell brought a lot of crystallized fruits from new orleans for you she wants to know if she shall send them around on bois d arc or keep them til you return answer write to your father he thinks you are leaving him out writing to everybody else first write we have the boss trick here now have sold about ten boxes of cigars betting on it in the store take four nickels and solder them together so the solder will not appear then cut out of three of them square hole like this illustration take about twelve other nickels and on top of them you lay a small die with the six up that will fit easily in the hole without being noticed you lay the four nickels over this and all presents the appearance of a stack of nickels you do all this privately so everybody will suppose it is nothing but a stack of five cent pieces you then lay another small die on top of the stack with the ace up you have a small tin cup shaped like this illustration made for the purpose you let everybody see the ace and then say you propose to turn the ace into a six you lay the tin cup carefully over the stack this way and feel around in your pocket for a pencil and not finding one the rest of this letter is lost austin texas may dear dave i received your two letters and have commenced two or three in reply but always failed to say what i wanted to and destroyed them all i heard from joe that you would probably remain in colorado i hope you will succeed in making a good thing out of it if you conclude to do so but would like to see you back again in austin if there is anything i can do for you here let me know town is fearfully dull except for the frequent raids of the servant girl annihilators who make things lively during the dead hours of the night if it were not for them items of interest would be very scarce as you may see by the statesman our serenading party has developed new and alarming modes of torture for our helpless and sleeping victims last thursday night we loaded up a small organ on a hack and with our other usual instruments made an assault upon the quiet air of midnight that made the atmosphere turn pale after going the rounds we were halted on the avenue by fritz hartkopf and ordered into his salon we went in carrying the organ etc a large crowd of bums immediately gathered prominent among which were to be seen percy james theodore hillyer randolph burmond charlie hicks and after partaking freely of lemonade we wended our way down and were duly halted and treated in the same manner by other hospitable gentlemen we were called in at several places while wit and champagne rhein wine etc flowed in a most joyous and hilarious manner it was one of the most recherche and per diem affairs ever known in the city nothing occurred to mar the pleasure of the hour except a trifling incident that might be construed as malapropos and post meridian by the hypercritical mr charles sims on attempting to introduce mr charles hicks and your humble servant to young

upstairs and dressed in my usual bijou and operatic style and rolled away to the opera emma sang finely i applauded at the wrong times and praised her rendering of the chromatic scale when she was

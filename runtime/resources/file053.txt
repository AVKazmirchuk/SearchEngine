if i am true and if men are hidden to shoot him it is a terrible thing an hour before daybreak this is to be come my dear one and kill this man and take me for your tonia do not try to take hold of him alive but kill him quickly knowing all you should do that you must come long before the time and hide yourself in the little shed near the jacal where the wagon and saddles are kept it is dark in there he will wear my red skirt and blue waist and brown mantilla i send you a hundred kisses come surely and shoot quickly and straight thine own tonia sandridge quickly explained to his men the official part of the missive the rangers protested against his going alone i ll get him easy enough said the lieutenant the girl s got him trapped and don t even think he ll get the drop on me sandridge saddled his horse and rode to the lone wolf crossing he tied his big dun in a clump of brush on the arroyo took his winchester from its scabbard and carefully approached the perez jacal there was only the half of a high moon drifted over by ragged milk white gulf clouds the wagon shed was an excellent place for ambush and the ranger got inside it safely in the black shadow of the brush shelter in front of the jacal he could see a horse tied and hear him impatiently pawing the hard trodden earth he waited almost an hour before two figures came out of the jacal one in man s clothes quickly mounted the horse and galloped past the wagon shed toward the crossing and village and then the other figure in skirt waist and mantilla over its head stepped out into the faint moonlight gazing after the rider sandridge thought he would take his chance then before tonia rode back he fancied she might not care to see it throw up your hands he ordered loudly stepping out of the wagon shed with his winchester at his shoulder there was a quick turn of the figure but no movement to obey so the ranger pumped in the bullets one two three and then twice more for you never could be too sure of bringing down the cisco kid there was no danger of missing at ten paces even in that half moonlight the old ancestor asleep on his blanket was awakened by the shots listening further he heard a great cry from some man in mortal distress or anguish and rose up grumbling at the disturbing ways of moderns the tall red ghost of a man burst into the jacal reaching one hand shaking like a tule reed for the lantern hanging on its nail the other spread a letter on the table look at this letter perez cried the man who wrote it ah dios it is senor sandridge mumbled the old man approaching pues senor that letter was written by el chivato as he is called by the man of tonia they say he is a bad man i do not know while tonia slept he wrote the letter and sent it by this old hand of mine to domingo sales to be brought to you is there anything wrong in the letter i am very old and i did not know valgame dios it is a very foolish world and there is nothing in the house to drink nothing to drink just then all that sandridge could think of to do was to go outside and throw himself face downward in the dust by the side of his humming bird of whom not a feather fluttered he was not a caballero by instinct and he could not understand the niceties of revenge a mile away the rider who had ridden past the wagon shed struck up a harsh untuneful song the words of which began don t you monkey with my lulu girl or i ll tell you what i ll do the sphinx apple twenty miles out from paradise and fifteen miles short of sunrise city bildad rose the stage driver stopped his team a furious snow had been falling all day eight inches it measured now on a level the remainder of the road was not without peril in daylight creeping along the ribs of a bijou range of ragged mountains now when both snow and night masked its dangers further travel was not to be thought of said bildad rose so he pulled up his four stout horses and delivered to his five passengers oral deductions of his wisdom judge menefee to whom men granted leadership and the initiatory as upon a silver salver sprang from the coach at once four of his fellow passengers followed inspired by his example ready to explore to objurgate to resist to submit to proceed according as their prime factor might be inclined to sway them the fifth passenger a young woman remained in the coach bildad had halted upon the shoulder of the first mountain spur two rail fences ragged black hemmed the road fifty yards above the upper fence showing a dark blot in the white drifts stood a small house upon this house descended or rather ascended judge menefee and his cohorts with boyish whoops born of the snow and stress they called they pounded at window and door at the inhospitable silence they waxed restive they assaulted and forced the pregnable barriers and invaded the premises the watchers from the coach heard stumblings and shoutings from the interior of the ravaged house before long a light within flickered glowed flamed high and bright and cheerful then came running back through the driving flakes the exuberant explorers more deeply pitched than the clarion even orchestral in volume the voice of judge menefee proclaimed the succour that lay in apposition with their state of travail the one room of the

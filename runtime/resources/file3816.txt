two brown hair pleasant ways the kind of a lady for the place a description of the sandbag if you please she begins why ma am says i this graft of ours is so nice and refined and romantic it would make the balcony scene in romeo and juliet look like second story work we talked it over and miss malloy agreed to come in as a business partner she said she was glad to get a chance to give up her place as stenographer and secretary to a suburban lot company and go into something respectable this is the way we worked our scheme first i figured it out by a kind of a proverb the best grafts in the world are built up on copy book maxims and psalms and proverbs and esau s fables they seem to kind of hit off human nature our peaceful little swindle was constructed on the old saying the whole push loves a lover one evening buck and miss malloy drives up like blazes in a buggy to a farmer s door she is pale but affectionate clinging to his arm always clinging to his arm any one can see that she is a peach and of the cling variety they claim they are eloping for to be married on account of cruel parents they ask where they can find a preacher farmer says b gum there ain t any preacher nigher than reverend abels four miles over on caney creek farmeress wipes her hand on her apron and rubbers through her specs illustration she is a peach and of the cling variety then lo and look ye up the road from the other way jogs parleyvoo pickens in a gig dressed in black white necktie long face sniffing his nose emitting a spurious kind of noise resembling the long meter doxology b jinks says farmer if thar ain t a preacher now it transpires that i am rev abijah green travelling over to little bethel school house for to preach next sunday the young folks will have it they must be married for pa is pursuing them with the plow mules and the buckboard so the reverend green after hesitating marries em in the farmer s parlor and farmer grins and has in cider and says b gum and farmeress sniffles a bit and pats the bride on the shoulder and parleyvoo pickens the wrong reverend writes out a marriage certificate and farmer and farmeress sign it as witnesses and the parties of the first second and third part gets in their vehicles and rides away oh that was an idyllic graft true love and the lowing kine and the sun shining on the red barns it certainly had all other impostures i know about beat to a batter so the reverend green after hesitations marries em in the farmer s parlor i suppose i happened along in time to marry buck and miss malloy at about twenty farm houses i hated to think how the romance was going to fade later on when all them marriage certificates turned up in banks where we d discounted em and the farmers had to pay them notes of hand they d signed running from to on the th day of may us three divided about miss malloy nearly cried with joy you don t often see a tenderhearted girl or one that is bent on doing right boys says she dabbing her eyes with a little handkerchief this stake comes in handier than a powder rag at a fat men s ball it gives me a chance to reform i was trying to get out of the real estate business when you fellows came along but if you hadn t taken me in on this neat little proposition for removing the cuticle of the rutabaga propagators i m afraid i d have got into something worse i was about to accept a place in one of these women s auxiliary bazars where they build a parsonage by selling a spoonful of chicken salad and a cream puff for seventy five cents and calling it a business man s lunch now i can go into a square honest business and give all them queer jobs the shake i m going to cincinnati and start a palm reading and clairvoyant joint as madame saramaloi the egyptian sorceress i shall give everybody a dollar s worth of good honest prognostication good by boys take my advice and go into some decent fake get friendly with the police and newspapers and you ll be all right so then we all shook hands and miss malloy left us me and buck also rose up and sauntered off a few hundred miles for we didn t care to be around when them marriage certificates fell due with about between us we hit that bumptious little town off the new jersey coast they call new york if there ever was an aviary overstocked with jays it is that yaptown on the hudson cosmopolitan they call it you bet so s a piece of fly paper you listen close when they re buzzing and trying to pull their feet out of the sticky stuff little old new york s good enough for us that s what they sing there s enough reubs walk down broadway in one hour to buy up a week s output of the factory in augusta maine that makes knaughty knovelties and the little phine phun oroide gold finger ring that sticks a needle in your friend s hand you d think new york people was all wise but no they don t get a chance to learn everything s too compressed even the hayseeds are baled hayseeds but what else can you expect from a town that s shut off from the world by the ocean on one side and new jersey on the other it s no place for an honest grafter with a small capital there s too big a protective tariff on bunco even when giovanni sells a quart of warm worms and chestnut hulls he has to hand out a pint to an insectivorous cop and the hotel man charges double for everything in the bill that he sends by the patrol wagon to the altar where the duke is about to marry the heiress but old badville near coney is the ideal burg for a refined piece of piracy if you can pay the bunco duty imported grafts come pretty high the custom house officers that look after it carry clubs and it s hard to smuggle in even a bib and tucker swindle to work brooklyn with unless you can pay the toll but now me and buck having capital descends upon new york to try and trade the metropolitan backwoodsmen a few glass beads for real estate just as the vans did a hundred or two years ago at an east side hotel we gets acquainted with romulus g atterbury a man with the finest head for financial operations i ever saw it was all bald and glossy except for gray side whiskers seeing that head behind an office railing and you d deposit a million with it without a receipt this atterbury was well dressed though he ate seldom and the synopsis of his talk would make the conversation of a siren sound like a cab driver s kick he said he used to be a member of the stock exchange but some of the big capitalists got jealous and formed a ring that forced him to sell his seat atterbury got to liking me and buck and he begun to throw on the canvas for us some of the schemes that had caused his hair to evacuate he had one scheme for starting a national bank on that made the mississippi bubble look as solid as a glass marble he talked this to us for three days and when his throat was good and sore we told him about the roll we had atterbury borrowed a quarter from us and went out and got a box of throat lozenges and started all over again this time he talked bigger things and he got us to see em as he did the scheme he laid out looked like a sure winner and he talked me and buck into putting our capital against his burnished dome of thought it looked all right for a kid gloved graft it seemed to be just about an inch and a half outside of the reach of the police and as money making as a mint it was just what me and buck wanted a regular business at a permanent stand with an open air spieling with tonsilitis on the street corners every evening so in six weeks you see a handsome furnished set of offices down in the wall street neighborhood with the golconda gold bond and investment company in gilt letters on the door and you see in his private room with the door open the secretary and treasurer mr buckingham skinner costumed like the lilies of the conservatory with his high silk hat close to his hand nobody yet ever saw buck outside of an instantaneous reach for his hat and you might perceive the president and general manager mr r g atterbury with his priceless polished poll busy in the main office room dictating letters to a shorthand countess who has got pomp and a pompadour that is no less than a guarantee to investors there is a bookkeeper and an assistant and a general atmosphere of varnish and culpability at another desk the eye is relieved by the sight of an ordinary man attired with unscrupulous plainness sitting with his feet up eating apples with his obnoxious hat on the back of his head that man is no other than colonel tecumseh once parleyvoo pickens the vice president of the company no recherch rags for me i says to atterbury when we was organizing the stage properties of the robbery i m a plain man says i and i do not use pajamas french or military hair brushes cast me for the role of the rhinestone in the rough or i don t go on exhibition if you can use me in my natural though displeasing form do so dress you up says atterbury i should say not just as you are you re worth more to the business than a whole roomful of the things they pin chrysanthemums on you re to play the part of the solid but disheveled capitalist from the far west you despise the conventions you ve got so many stocks you can afford to shake socks conservative homely rough shrewd saving that s your pose it s a winner in new york keep your feet on the desk and eat apples whenever anybody comes in eat an apple let em see you stuff the peelings in a drawer of your desk look as economical and rich and rugged as you can i followed out atterbury s instructions i played the rocky mountain capitalist without ruching or frills the way i deposited apple peelings to my credit in a drawer when any customers came in made hetty green look like a spendthrift i could hear atterbury saying to victims as he smiled at me indulgent and venerating that s our vice president colonel pickens fortune in western investments delightfully plain manners but could sign his check for half a million simple as a child wonderful head conservative and careful almost to a fault atterbury managed the business me and buck never quite understood all of it though he explained it to us in full it seems the company was a kind of cooperative one and everybody that bought stock shared in the profits first we officers bought up a controlling interest we had to have that of the shares at cents a hundred just what the printer charged us and the rest went to the public at a dollar each the company guaranteed the stockholders a profit of ten per cent each month payable on the last day thereof when any stockholder had paid in as much as the company issued him a gold bond and he became a bondholder i asked atterbury one day what benefits and appurtenances these gold bonds was to an investor more so than the immunities and privileges enjoyed by the common sucker who only owned stock atterbury picked up one of them gold bonds all gilt and lettered up with flourishes and a big red seal tied with a blue ribbon in a bowknot and he looked at me like his feelings was hurt my dear colonel pickens says he you have no soul for art think of a thousand homes made happy by possessing one of these beautiful gems of the lithographer s skill think of the joy in the household where one of these gold bonds hangs by a pink cord to the what not or is chewed by the baby caroling gleefully upon the floor ah i see your eye growing moist colonel i have touched you have i not you have not says i for i ve been watching you the moisture you see is apple juice you can t expect one man to act as a human cider press and an art connoisseur too atterbury attended to the details of the concern as i understand it they was simple the investors in stock paid in their money and well i guess that s all they had to do the company received it and i don t call to mind anything else me and buck knew more about selling corn salve than we did about wall street but even we could see how the golconda gold bond investment company was making money you take in money and pay back ten per cent of it it s plain enough that you make a clean legitimate profit of per cent less expenses as long as the fish bite atterbury wanted to be president and treasurer too but buck winks an eye at him and says you was to furnish the brains do you call it good brain work when you propose to take in money at the door too think again i hereby nominate myself treasurer ad valorem sine die and by acclamation i chip in that much brain work free me and pickens we furnished the capital and we ll handle the unearned increment as it incremates it costs us for office rent and first payment on furniture more went for printing and advertising atterbury knew his business three months to a minute we ll last says he a day longer than that and we ll have to either go under or go under an alias by that time we ought to clean up and then a money belt and a lower berth for me and the yellow journals and the furniture men can pick the bones our ads done the work country weeklies and washington hand press dailies of course says i when we was ready to make contracts man says atterbury as its advertising manager you would cause a limburger cheese factory to remain undiscovered during a hot summer the game we re after is right here in new york and brooklyn and the harlem reading rooms they re the people that the street car fenders and the answers to correspondents columns and the pickpocket notices are made for we want our ads in the biggest city dailies top of column next to editorials on radium and pictures of the girl doing health exercises pretty soon the money begins to roll in buck didn t have to pretend to be busy his desk was piled high up with money orders and checks and greenbacks people began to drop in the office and buy stock every day most of the shares went in small amounts and and and a good many and lots and the bald and inviolate cranium of president atterbury shines with enthusiasm and demerit while colonel tecumseh pickens the rude but reputable croesus of the west consumes so many apples that the peelings hang to the floor from the mahogany garbage chest that he calls his desk just as atterbury said we ran along about three months without being troubled buck cashed the paper as fast as it came in and kept the money in a safe deposit vault a block or so away buck never thought much of banks for such purposes we paid the interest regular on the stock we d sold so there was nothing for anybody to squeal about we had nearly on hand and all three of us had been living as high as prize fighters out of training one morning as me and buck sauntered into the office fat and flippant from our noon grub we met an easy looking fellow with a bright eye and a pipe in his mouth coming out we found atterbury looking like he d been caught a mile from home in a wet shower know that man he asked us we said we didn t i don t either says atterbury wiping off his head but i ll bet enough gold bonds to paper a cell in the tombs that he s a newspaper reporter what did he want asks buck information says our president said he was thinking of buying some stock he asked me about nine hundred questions and every one of em hit some sore place in the business i know he s on a paper you can t fool me you see a man about half shabby with an eye like a gimlet smoking cut plug with dandruff on his coat collar and knowing more than j p morgan and shakespeare put together if that ain t a reporter i never saw one i was afraid of this i don t mind detectives and post office inspectors i talk to em eight minutes and then sell em stock but them reporters take the starch out of my collar boys i recommend that we declare a dividend and fade away the signs point that way me and buck talked to atterbury and got him to stop sweating and stand still that fellow didn t look like a reporter to us reporters always pull out a pencil and tablet on you and tell you a story you ve heard and strikes you for the drinks but atterbury was shaky and nervous all day the next day me and buck comes down from the hotel about ten thirty on the way we buys the papers and the first thing we see is a column on the front page about our little imposition it was a shame the way that reporter intimated that we were no blood relatives of the late george w childs he tells all about the scheme as he sees it in a rich racy kind of a guying style that might amuse most anybody except a stockholder yes atterbury was right it behooveth the gaily clad treasurer and the pearly pated president and the rugged vice president of the golconda gold bond and investment company to go away real sudden and quick that their days might be longer upon the land me and buck hurries down to the office we finds on the stairs and in the hall a crowd of people trying to squeeze into our office which is already jammed full inside to the railing they ve nearly all got golconda stock and gold bonds in their hands me and buck judged they d been reading the papers too we stopped and looked at our stockholders some surprised it wasn t quite the kind of a gang we supposed had been investing they all looked like poor people there was plenty of old women and lots of young girls that you d say worked in factories and mills some was old men that looked like war veterans and some was crippled and a good many was just kids bootblacks and newsboys and messengers some was working men in overalls with their sleeves rolled up not one of the gang looked like a stockholder in anything unless it was a peanut stand but they all had golconda stock and looked as sick as you please i saw a queer kind of a pale look come on buck s face when he sized up the crowd he stepped up to a sickly looking woman and says madam do you own any of this stock i put in a hundred dollars says the woman faint like it was all i had saved in a year one of my children is dying at home now and i haven t a cent in the house i came to see if i could draw out some the circulars said you could draw it at any time but they say now i will lose it all there was a smart kind of kid in the gang i guess he was a newsboy i got in twenty fi mister he says looking hopeful at buck s silk hat and clothes dey paid me two fifty a mont on it say a man tells me dey can t do dat and be on de square is dat straight do you guess i can get out my twenty fi some of the old women was crying the factory girls was plumb distracted they d lost all their savings and they d be docked for the time they lost coming to see about it there was one girl a pretty one in a red shawl crying in a corner like her heart would dissolve buck goes over and asks her about it it ain t so much losing the money mister says she shaking all over though i ve been two years saving it up but jakey won t marry me now he ll take rosa steinfeld i know j j jakey she s got in the savings bank ai ai ai she sings out buck looks all around with that same funny look on his face and then we see leaning against the wall puffing at his pipe with his eye shining at us this newspaper reporter buck and me walks over to him you re a real interesting writer says buck how far do you mean to carry it anything more up your sleeve oh i m just waiting around says the reporter smoking away in case any news turns up it s up to your stockholders now some of them might complain you know isn t that the patrol wagon now he says listening to a sound outside no he goes on that s doc whittleford s old cadaver coup from the roosevelt i ought to know that gong yes i suppose i ve written some interesting stuff at times you wait says buck i m going to throw an item of news in your way buck reaches in his pocket and hands me a key i knew what he meant before he spoke confounded old buccaneer i knew what he meant they don t make them any better than buck pick says he looking at me hard ain t this graft a little out of our line do we want jakey to marry rosa steinfeld you ve got my vote says i i ll have it here in ten minutes and i starts for the safe deposit vaults i comes back with the money done up in a big bundle and then buck and me takes the journalist reporter around to another door and we let ourselves into one of the office rooms now my literary friend says buck take a chair and keep still and i ll give you an interview you see before you two grafters from graftersville grafter county arkansas me and pick have sold brass jewelry hair tonic song books marked cards patent medicines connecticut smyrna rugs furniture polish and albums in every town from old point comfort to the golden gate we ve grafted a dollar whenever we saw one that had a surplus look to it but we never went after the simoleon in the toe of the sock under the loose brick in the corner of the kitchen hearth there s an old saying you may have heard fussily decency averni which means it s an easy slide from the street faker s dry goods box to a desk in wall street we ve took that slide but we didn t know exactly what was at the bottom of it now you ought to be wise but you ain t you ve got new york wiseness which means that you judge a man by the outside of his clothes that ain t right you ought to look at the lining and seams and the button holes while we are waiting for the patrol wagon you might get out your little stub pencil and take notes for another funny piece in the paper and then buck turns to me and says i don t care what atterbury thinks he only put in brains and if he gets his capital out he s lucky but what do you say pick me says i you ought to know me buck i didn t know who was buying the stock all right says buck and then he goes through the inside door into the main office and looks at the gang trying to squeeze through the railing atterbury and his hat was gone and buck makes em a short speech all you lambs get in line you re going to get your wool back don t shove so get in a line a line not in a pile lady will you please stop bleating your money s waiting for you here sonny don t climb over that railing your dimes are safe don t cry sis you ain t out a cent get in line i say here pick come and straighten em out and let em through and out by the other door buck takes off his coat pushes his silk hat on the back of his head and lights up a reina victoria he sets at the table with the boodle before him all done up in neat packages i gets the stockholders strung out and marches em single file through from the main room and the reporter man passes em out of the side door into the hall again as they go by buck takes up the stock and the gold bonds paying em cash dollar for dollar the same as they paid in the shareholders of the golconda gold bond and investment company can t hardly believe it they almost grabs the money out of buck s hands some of the women keep on crying for it s a custom of the sex to cry when they have sorrow to weep when they have joy and to shed tears whenever they find themselves without either the old women s fingers shake when they stuff the skads in the bosom of their rusty dresses the factory girls just stoop over and flap their dry goods a second and you hear the elastic go pop as the currency goes down in the ladies department of the old domestic lisle thread bank some of the stockholders that had been doing the jeremiah act the loudest outside had spasms of restored confidence and wanted to leave the money invested salt away that chicken feed in your duds and skip along says buck what business have you got investing in bonds the tea pot or the crack in the wall behind the clock for your hoard of pennies when the pretty girl in the red shawl cashes in buck hands her an extra twenty a wedding present says our treasurer from the golconda company and say if jakey ever follows his nose even at a respectful distance around the corner where rosa steinfeld lives you are hereby authorized to knock a couple of inches of it off when they was all paid off and gone buck calls the newspaper reporter and shoves the rest of the money over to him you begun this says buck now finish it over there are the books showing every share and bond issued here s the money to cover except what we ve spent to live on you ll have to act as receiver i guess you ll do the square thing on account of your paper this is the best way we know how to settle it me and our substantial but apple weary vice president are going to follow the example of our revered president and skip now have you got enough news for to day or do you want to interview us on etiquette and the best way to make over an old taffeta skirt news says the newspaper man taking his pipe out do you think i could use this i don t want to lose my job suppose i go around to the office and tell em this happened what ll the managing editor say he ll just hand me a pass to bellevue and tell me to come back when i get cured i might turn in a story about a sea serpent wiggling up broadway but i haven t got the nerve to try em with a pipe like this a get rich quick scheme excuse me gang giving back the boodle oh no i m not on the comic supplement you can t understand it of course says buck with his hand on the door knob me and pick ain t wall streeters like you know em we never allowed to swindle sick old women and working girls and take nickels off of kids in the lines of graft we ve worked we took money from the people the lord made to be buncoed sports and rounders and smart alecks and street crowds that always have a few dollars to throw away and farmers that wouldn t ever be happy if the grafters didn t come around and play with em when they sold their crops we never cared to fish for the kind of suckers that bite here no sir we got too much respect for the profession and for ourselves good by to you mr receiver here says the journalist reporter wait a minute there s a broker i know on the next floor wait till i put this truck in his safe i want you fellows to take a drink on me before you go on you says buck winking solemn don t you go and try to make em believe at the office you said that thanks we can t spare the time i reckon so long and me and buck slides out the door and that s the way the golconda company went into involuntary liquefaction if you had seen me and buck the next night you d have had to go to a little bum hotel over near the west side ferry landings we was in a little back room and i was filling up a gross of six ounce bottles with hydrant water colored red with aniline and flavored with cinnamon buck was smoking contented and he wore a decent brown derby in place of his silk hat it s a good thing pick says he as he drove in the corks that we got brady to lend us his horse and wagon for a week we ll rustle up the stake by then this hair tonic ll sell right along over in jersey bald heads ain t popular over there on account of the mosquitoes directly i dragged out my valise and went down in it for labels hair tonic labels are out says i only about a dozen on hand buy some more says buck we investigated our pockets and found we had just enough money to settle our hotel bill in the morning and pay our passage over the ferry plenty of the shake the shakes chill cure labels says i after looking what more do you want says buck slap em on the chill season is just opening up in the hackensack low grounds what s hair anyway if you have to shake it off we pasted on the chill cure labels about half an hour and buck says making an honest livin s better than that wall street anyhow ain t it pick you bet says i hostages to momus i i never got inside of the legitimate line of graft but once but one time as i say i reversed the decision of the revised statutes and undertook a thing that i d have to apologize for even under the new jersey trust laws me and caligula polk of muskogee in the creek nation was down in the mexican state of tamaulipas running a peripatetic lottery and monte game now selling lottery tickets is a government graft in mexico just like selling forty eight cents worth of postage stamps for forty nine cents is over here so uncle porfirio he instructs the rurales to attend to our case rurales they re a sort of country police but don t draw any mental crayon portraits of the worthy constables with a tin star and a gray goatee the rurales well if we d mount our supreme court on broncos arm em with winchesters and start em out after john doe et al we d have about the same thing when the rurales started for us we started for the states they chased us as far as matamoras we hid in a brickyard and that night we swum the rio grande caligula with a brick in each hand absent minded which he drops upon the soil of texas forgetting he had em from there we emigrated to san antone and then over to new orleans where we took a rest and in that town of cotton bales and other adjuncts to female beauty we made the acquaintance of drinks invented by the creoles during the period of louey cans in which they are still served at the side doors the most i can remember of this town is that me and caligula and a frenchman named mccarty wait a minute adolph mccarty was trying to make the french quarter pay up the back trading stamps due on the louisiana purchase when somebody hollers that the johndarms are coming i have an insufficient recollection of buying two yellow tickets through a window and i seemed to see a man swing a lantern and say all aboard i remembered no more except that the train butcher was covering me and caligula up with augusta j evans s works and figs when we become revised we find that we have collided up against the state of georgia at a spot hitherto unaccounted for in time tables except by an asterisk which means that trains stop every other thursday on signal by tearing up a rail we was waked up in a yellow pine hotel by the noise of flowers and the smell of birds yes sir for the wind was banging sunflowers as big as buggy wheels against the weatherboarding and the chicken coop was right under the window me and caligula dressed and went down stairs the landlord was shelling peas on the front porch he was six feet of chills and fever and hongkong in complexion though in other respects he seemed amenable in the exercise of his sentiments and features caligula who is a spokesman by birth and a small man though red haired and impatient of painfulness of any kind speaks up pardner says he good morning and be darned to you would you mind telling us why we are at we know the reason we are where but can t exactly figure out on account of at what place well gentlemen says the landlord i reckoned you all would be inquiring this morning you all dropped off of the nine thirty train here last night and you was right tight yes you was right smart in liquor i can inform you that you are now in the town of mountain valley in the state of georgia on top of that says caligula don t say that we can t have anything to eat sit down gentlemen says the landlord and in twenty minutes i ll call you to the best breakfast you can get anywhere in town that breakfast turned out to be composed of fried bacon and a yellowish edifice that proved up something between pound cake and flexible sandstone the landlord calls it corn pone and then he sets out a dish of the exaggerated breakfast food known as hominy and so me and caligula makes the acquaintance of the celebrated food that enabled every johnny reb to lick one and two thirds yankees for nearly four years at a stretch the wonder to me is says caligula that uncle robert lee s boys didn t chase the grant and sherman outfit clear up into hudson s bay it would have made me that mad to eat this truck they call mahogany hog and hominy i explains is the staple food of this section then says caligula they ought to keep it where it belongs i thought this was a hotel and not a stable now if we was in muskogee at the st lucifer house i d show you some breakfast grub antelope steaks and fried liver to begin on and venison cutlets with chili con carne and pineapple fritters and then some sardines and mixed pickles and top it off with a can of yellow clings and a bottle of beer you won t find a layout like that on the bill of affairs of any of your eastern restauraws too lavish says i i ve traveled and i m unprejudiced there ll never be a perfect breakfast eaten until some man grows arms long enough to stretch down to new orleans for his coffee and over to norfolk for his rolls and reaches up to vermont and digs a slice of butter out of a spring house and then turns over a beehive close to a white clover patch out in indiana for the rest then he d come pretty close to making a meal on the amber that the gods eat on mount olympia too ephemeral says caligula i d want ham and eggs or rabbit stew anyhow for a chaser what do you consider the most edifying and casual in the way of a dinner i ve been infatuated from time to time i answers with fancy ramifications of grub such as terrapins lobsters reed birds jambolaya and canvas covered ducks but after all there s nothing less displeasing to me than a beefsteak smothered in mushrooms on a balcony in sound of the broadway streetcars with a hand organ playing down below and the boys hollering extras about the latest suicide for the wine give me a reasonable ponty cany and that s all except a demi tasse well says caligula i reckon in new york you get to be a conniseer and when you go around with the demi tasse you are naturally bound to buy em stylish grub it s a great town for epicures says i you d soon fall into their ways if you was there i ve heard it was says caligula but i reckon i wouldn t i can polish my fingernails all they need myself ii after breakfast we went out on the front porch lighted up two of the landlord s flor de upas perfectos and took a look at georgia the installment of scenery visible to the eye looked mighty poor as far as we could see was red hills all washed down with gullies and scattered over with patches of piny woods blackberry bushes was all that kept the rail fences from falling down about fifteen miles over to the north was a little range of well timbered mountains that town of mountain valley wasn t going about a dozen people permeated along the sidewalks but what you saw mostly was rain barrels and roosters and boys poking around with sticks in piles of ashes made by burning the scenery of uncle tom shows and just then there passes down on the other side of the street a high man in a long black coat and a beaver hat all the people in sight bowed and some crossed the street to shake hands with him folks came out of stores and houses to holler at him women leaned out of windows and smiled and all the kids stopped playing to look at him our landlord stepped out on the porch and bent himself double like a carpenter s rule and sung out good morning colonel when he was a dozen yards gone by and is that alexander pa says caligula to the landlord and why is he called great that gentlemen says the landlord is no less than colonel jackson t rockingham the president of the sunrise edenville tap railroad mayor of mountain valley and chairman of the perry county board of immigration and public improvements been away a good many years hasn t he i asked no sir colonel rockingham is going down to the post office for his mail his fellow citizens take pleasure in greeting him thus every morning the colonel is our most prominent citizen besides the height of the stock of the sunrise edenville tap railroad he owns a thousand acres of that land across the creek mountain valley delights sir to honor a citizen of such worth and public spirit for an hour that afternoon caligula sat on the back of his neck on the porch and studied a newspaper which was unusual in a man who despised print when he was through he took me to the end of the porch among the sunlight and drying dish towels i knew that caligula had invented a new graft for he chewed the ends of his mustache and ran the left catch of his suspenders up and down which was his way what is it now i asks just so it ain t floating mining stocks or raising pennsylvania pinks we ll talk it over pennsylvania pinks oh that refers to a coin raising scheme of the keystoners they burn the soles of old women s feet to make them tell where their money s hid caligula s words in business was always few and bitter you see them mountains said he pointing and you seen that colonel man that owns railroads and cuts more ice when he goes to the post office than roosevelt does when he cleans em out what we re going to do is to kidnap the latter into the former and inflict a ransom of ten thousand dollars illegality says i shaking my head i knew you d say that says caligula at first sight it does seem to jar peace and dignity but it don t i got the idea out of that newspaper would you commit aspersions on a equitable graft that the united states itself has condoned and indorsed and ratified kidnapping says i is an immoral function in the derogatory list of the statutes if the united states upholds it it must be a recent enactment of ethics along with race suicide and rural delivery listen says caligula and i ll explain the case set down in the papers here was a greek citizen named burdick harris says he captured for a graft by africans and the united states sends two gunboats to the state of tangiers and makes the king of morocco give up seventy thousand dollars to raisuli go slow says i that sounds too international to take in all at once it s like thimble thimble who s got the naturalization papers twas press despatches from constantinople says caligula you ll see six months from now they ll be confirmed by the monthly magazines and then it won t be long till you ll notice em alongside the photos of the mount pelee eruption photos in the while you get your hair cut weeklies it s all right pick this african man raisuli hides burdick harris up in the mountains and advertises his price to the governments of different nations now you wouldn t think for a minute goes on caligula that john hay would have chipped in and helped this graft along if it wasn t a square game would you why no says i i ve always stood right in with bryan s policies and i couldn t consciously say a word against the republican administration just now but if harris was a greek on what system of international protocols did hay interfere it ain t exactly set forth in the papers says caligula i suppose it s a matter of sentiment you know he wrote this poem little breeches and them greeks wear little or none but anyhow john hay sends the brooklyn and the olympia over and they cover africa with thirty inch guns and then hay cables after the health of the persona grata and how are they this morning he wires is burdick harris alive yet or mr raisuli dead and the king of morocco sends up the seventy thousand dollars and they turn burdick harris loose and there s not half the hard feelings among the nations about this little kidnapping matter as there was about the peace congress and burdick harris says to the reporters in the greek language that he s often heard about the united states and he admires roosevelt next to raisuli who is one of the whitest and most gentlemanly kidnappers that he ever worked alongside of so you see pick winds up caligula we ve got the law of nations on our side we ll cut this colonel man out of the herd and corral him in them little mountains and stick up his heirs and assigns for ten thousand dollars well you seldom little red headed territorial terror i answers you can t bluff your uncle tecumseh pickens i ll be your company in this graft but i misdoubt if you ve absorbed the inwardness of this burdick harris case calig and if on any morning we get a telegram from the secretary of state asking about the health of the scheme i propose to acquire the most propinquitous and celeritous mule in this section and gallop diplomatically over into the neighboring and peaceful nation of alabama iii me and caligula spent the next three days investigating the bunch of mountains into which we proposed to kidnap colonel jackson t rockingham we finally selected an upright slice of topography covered with bushes and trees that you could only reach by a secret path that we cut out up the side of it and the only way to reach the mountain was to follow up the bend of a branch that wound among the elevations then i took in hand an important subdivision of the proceedings i went up to atlanta on the train and laid in a two hundred and fifty dollar supply of the most gratifying and efficient lines of grub that money could buy i always was an admirer of viands in their more palliative and revised stages hog and hominy are not only inartistic to my stomach but they give indigestion to my moral sentiments and i thought of colonel jackson t rockingham president of the sunrise edenville tap railroad and how he would miss the luxury of his home fare as is so famous among wealthy southerners so i sunk half of mine and caligula s capital in as elegant a layout of fresh and canned provisions as burdick harris or any other professional kidnappee ever saw in a camp i put another hundred in a couple of cases of bordeaux two quarts of cognac two hundred havana regalias with gold bands and a camp stove and stools and folding cots i wanted colonel rockingham to be comfortable and i hoped after he gave up the ten thousand dollars he would give me and caligula as good a name for gentlemen and entertainers as the greek man did the friend of his that made the united states his bill collector against africa when the goods came down from atlanta we hired a wagon moved them up on the little mountain and established camp and then we laid for the colonel we caught him one morning about two miles out from mountain valley on his way to look after some of his burnt umber farm land he was an elegant old gentleman as thin and tall as a trout rod with frazzled shirt cuffs and specs on a black string we explained to him brief and easy what we wanted and caligula showed him careless the handle of his forty five under his coat what says colonel rockingham bandits in perry county georgia i shall see that the board of immigration and public improvements hears of this be so unfoolhardy as to climb into that buggy says caligula by order of the board of perforation and public depravity this is a business meeting and we re anxious to adjourn sine qua non we drove colonel rockingham over the mountain and up the side of it as far as the buggy could go then we tied the horse and took our prisoner on foot up to the camp now colonel i says to him we re after the ransom me and my partner and no harm will come to you if the king of mor if your friends send up the dust in the mean time we are gentlemen the same as you and if you give us your word not to try to escape the freedom of the camp is yours i give you my word says the colonel all right says i and now it s eleven o clock and me and mr polk will proceed to inculcate the occasion with a few well timed trivialities in the way of grub thank you says the colonel i believe i could relish a slice of bacon and a plate of hominy but you won t says i emphatic not in this camp we soar in higher regions than them occupied by your celebrated but repulsive dish while the colonel read his paper me and caligula took off our coats and went in for a little luncheon de luxe just to show him caligula was a fine cook of the western brand he could toast a buffalo or fricassee a couple of steers as easy as a woman could make a cup of tea he was gifted in the way of knocking together edibles when haste and muscle and quantity was to be considered he held the record west of the arkansas river for frying pancakes with his left hand broiling venison cutlets with his right and skinning a rabbit with his teeth at the same time but i could do things en casserole and la creole and handle the oil and tobasco as gently and nicely as a french chef so at twelve o clock we had a hot lunch ready that looked like a banquet on a mississippi river steamboat we spread it on the tops of two or three big boxes opened two quarts of the red wine set the olives and a canned oyster cocktail and a ready made martini by the colonel s plate and called him to grub colonel rockingham drew up his campstool wiped off his specs and looked at the things on the table then i thought he was swearing and i felt mean because i hadn t taken more pains with the victuals but he wasn t he was asking a blessing and me and caligula hung our heads and i saw a tear drop from the colonel s eye into his cocktail i never saw a man eat with so much earnestness and application not hastily like a grammarian or one of the canal but slow and appreciative like a anaconda or a real vive bonjour in an hour and a half the colonel leaned back i brought him a pony of brandy and his black coffee and set the box of havana regalias on the table gentlemen says he blowing out the smoke and trying to breathe it back again when we view the eternal hills and the smiling and beneficent landscape and reflect upon the goodness of the creator who excuse me colonel says i but there s some business to attend to now and i brought out paper and pen and ink and laid em before him who do you want to send to for the money i asks i reckon says he after thinking a bit to the vice president of our railroad at the general offices of the company in edenville how far is it to edenville from here i asked about ten miles says he then i dictated these lines and colonel rockingham wrote them out i am kidnapped and held a prisoner by two desperate outlaws in a place which is useless to attempt to find they demand ten thousand dollars at once for my release the amount must be raised immediately and these directions followed come alone with the money to stony creek which runs out of blacktop mountains follow the bed of the creek till you come to a big flat rock on the left bank on which is marked a cross in red chalk stand on the rock and wave a white flag a guide will come to you and conduct you to where i am held lose no time after the colonel had finished this he asked permission to take on a postscript about how he was being treated so the railroad wouldn t feel uneasy in its bosom about him we agreed to that he wrote down that he had just had lunch with the two desperate ruffians and then he set down the whole bill of fare from cocktails to coffee he wound up with the remark that dinner would be ready about six and would probably be a more licentious and intemperate affair than lunch me and caligula read it and decided to let it go for we being cooks were amenable to praise though it sounded out of place on a sight draft for ten thousand dollars i took the letter over to the mountain valley road and watched for a messenger by and by a colored equestrian came along on horseback riding toward edenville i gave him a dollar to take the letter to the railroad offices and then i went back to camp iv about four o clock in the afternoon caligula who was acting as lookout calls to me i have to report a white shirt signalling on the starboard bow sir i went down the mountain and brought back a fat red man in an alpaca coat and no collar gentlemen says colonel rockingham allow me to introduce my brother captain duval c rockingham vice president of the sunrise edenville tap railroad otherwise the king of morocco says i i reckon you don t mind my counting the ransom just as a business formality well no not exactly says the fat man not when it comes i turned that matter over to our second vice president i was anxious after brother jackson s safetiness i reckon he ll be along right soon what does that lobster salad you mentioned taste like brother jackson mr vice president says i you ll oblige us by remaining here till the second v p arrives this is a private rehearsal and we don t want any roadside speculators selling tickets in half an hour caligula sings out again sail ho looks like an apron on a broomstick i perambulated down the cliff again and escorted up a man six foot three with a sandy beard and no other dimension that you could notice thinks i to myself if he s got ten thousand dollars on his person it s in one bill and folded lengthwise mr patterson g coble our second vice president announces the colonel glad to know you gentlemen says this coble i came up to disseminate the tidings that major tallahassee tucker our general passenger agent is now negotiating a peachcrate full of our railroad bonds with the perry county bank for a loan my dear colonel rockingham was that chicken gumbo or cracked goobers on the bill of fare in your note me and the conductor of fifty six was having a dispute about it another white wings on the rocks hollers caligula if i see any more i ll fire on em and swear they was torpedo boats the guide goes down again and convoys into the lair a person in blue overalls carrying an amount of inebriety and a lantern i am so sure that this is major tucker that i don t even ask him until we are up above and then i discover that it is uncle timothy the yard switchman at edenville who is sent ahead to flag our understandings with the gossip that judge pendergast the railroad s attorney is in the process of mortgaging colonel rockingham s farming lands to make up the ransom while he is talking two men crawl from under the bushes into camp and caligula with no white flag to disinter him from his plain duty draws his gun but again colonel rockingham intervenes and introduces mr jones and mr batts engineer and fireman of train number forty two excuse us says batts but me and jim have hunted squirrels all over this mounting and we don t need no white flag was that straight colonel about the plum pudding and pineapples and real store cigars towel on a fishing pole in the offing howls caligula suppose it s the firing line of the freight conductors and brakeman my last trip down says i wiping off my face if the s e t wants to run an excursion up here just because we kidnapped their president let em we ll put out our sign the kidnapper s cafe and trainmen s home this time i caught major tallahassee tucker by his own confession and i felt easier i asked him into the creek so i could drown him if he happened to be a track walker or caboose porter all the way up the mountain he driveled to me about asparagus on toast a thing that his intelligence in life had skipped up above i got his mind segregated from food and asked if he had raised the ransom my dear sir says he i succeeded in negotiating a loan on thirty thousand dollars worth of the bonds of our railroad and never mind just now major says i it s all right then wait till after dinner and we ll settle the business all of you gentlemen i continues to the crowd are invited to stay to dinner we have mutually trusted one another and the white flag is supposed to wave over the proceedings the correct idea says caligula who was standing by me two baggage masters and a ticket agent dropped out of a tree while you was below the last time did the major man bring the money he says i answered that he succeeded in negotiating the loan if any cooks ever earned ten

a frosty sparkle in the air had succeeded the drowsy warmth of the day and as this portent of a chilly night translated itself to the brain of sir peregrine he lengthened his stride and bethought him of shelter he travelled a road that faithfully followed the convolutions of the levee running along its base but whither he knew not bushes and rank grass crowded it to the wheel ruts and out of this ambuscade the pests of the lowlands swarmed after him humming a keen vicious soprano and as the night grew nearer although colder the whine of the mosquitoes became a greedy petulant snarl that shut out all other sounds to his right against the heavens he saw a green light moving and accompanying it the masts and funnels of a big incoming steamer moving as upon a screen at a magic lantern show and there were mysterious marshes at his left out of which came queer gurgling cries and a choked croaking the whistling vagrant struck up a merry warble to offset these melancholy influences and it is likely that never before since pan himself jigged it on his reeds had such sounds been heard in those depressing solitudes a distant clatter in the rear quickly developed into the swift beat of horses hoofs and whistling dick stepped aside into the dew wet grass to clear the track turning his head he saw approaching a fine team of stylish grays drawing a double surrey a stout man with a white moustache occupied the front seat giving all his attention to the rigid lines in his hands behind him sat a placid middle aged lady and a brilliant looking girl hardly arrived at young ladyhood the lap robe had slipped partly from the knees of the gentleman driving and whistling dick saw two stout canvas bags between his feet bags such as while loafing in cities he had seen warily transferred between express waggons and bank doors the remaining space in the vehicle was filled with parcels of various sizes and shapes as the surrey swept even with the sidetracked tramp the bright eyed girl seized by some merry madcap impulse leaned out toward him with a sweet dazzling smile and cried mer ry christ mas in a shrill plaintive treble such a thing had not often happened to whistling dick and he felt handicapped in devising the correct response but lacking time for reflection he let his instinct decide and snatching off his battered derby he rapidly extended it at arm s length and drew it back with a continuous motion and shouted a loud but ceremonious ah there after the flying surrey the sudden movement of the girl had caused one of the parcels to become unwrapped and something limp and black fell from it into the road the tramp picked it up and found it to be a new black silk stocking long and fine and slender it crunched crisply and yet with a luxurious softness between his fingers ther bloomin little skeezicks said whistling dick with a broad grin bisecting his freckled face w t d yer think of dat now mer ry chris mus sounded like a cuckoo clock da ts what she did dem guys is swells too bet yer life an der old un stacks dem sacks of dough down under his trotters like dey was common as dried apples been shoppin for chrismus and de kid s lost one of her new socks w ot she was goin to hold up santy wid de bloomin little skeezicks wit her mer ry chris mus w ot d yer t ink same as to say hello jack how goes it and as swell as fift av noo and as easy as a blowout in cincinnat whistling dick folded the stocking carefully and stuffed it into his pocket it was nearly two hours later when he came upon signs of habitation the buildings of an extensive plantation were brought into view by a turn in the road he easily selected the planter s residence in a large square building with two wings with numerous good sized well lighted windows and broad verandas running around its full extent it was set upon a smooth lawn which was faintly lit by the far reaching rays of the lamps within a noble grove surrounded it and old fashioned shrubbery grew thickly about the walks and fences the quarters of the hands and the mill buildings were situated at a distance in the rear the road was now enclosed on each side by a fence and presently as whistling dick drew nearer the house he suddenly stopped and sniffed the air if dere ain t a hobo stew cookin somewhere in dis immediate precint he said to himself me nose as quit tellin de trut without hesitation he climbed the fence to windward he found himself in an apparently disused lot where piles of old bricks were stacked and rejected decaying lumber in a corner he saw the faint glow of a fire that had become little more than a bed of living coals and he thought he could see some dim human forms sitting or lying about it he drew nearer and by the light of a little blaze that suddenly flared up he saw plainly the fat figure of a ragged man in an old brown sweater and cap dat man said whistling dick to himself softly is a dead ringer for boston harry i ll try him wit de high sign he whistled one or two bars of a rag time melody and the air was immediately taken up and then quickly ended with a peculiar run the first whistler walked confidently up to the fire the fat man looked up and spake in a loud asthmatic wheeze gents the unexpected but welcome addition to our circle is mr whistling dick an old friend of mine for whom i fully vouches the waiter will

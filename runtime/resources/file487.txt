a week was what it panned out that night at bob hart took off his hat and bade cherry good night at her boarding house door mr hart said she thoughtfully come inside just a few minutes we ve got our chance now to make good and make money what we want to do is to cut expenses every cent we can and save all we can right said bob it s business with me you ve got your scheme for banking yours and i dream every night of that bungalow with the jap cook and nobody around to raise trouble anything to enlarge the net receipts will engage my attention come inside just a few minutes repeated cherry deeply thoughtful i ve got a proposition to make to you that will reduce our expenses a lot and help you work out your own future and help me work out mine and all on business principles mice will play had a tremendously successful run in new york for ten weeks rather neat for a vaudeville sketch and then it started on the circuits without following it it may be said that it was a solid drawing card for two years without a sign of abated popularity sam packard manager of one of keetor s new york houses said of hart cherry as square and high toned a little team as ever came over the circuit it s a pleasure to read their names on the booking list quiet hard workers no johnny and mabel nonsense on the job to the minute straight home after their act and each of em as gentlemanlike as a lady i don t expect to handle any attractions that give me less trouble or more respect for the profession and now after so much cracking of a nutshell here is the kernel of the story at the end of its second season mice will play came back to new york for another run at the roof gardens and summer theatres there was never any trouble in booking it at the top notch price bob hart had his bungalow nearly paid for and cherry had so many savings deposit bank books that she had begun to buy sectional bookcases on the instalment plan to hold them i tell you these things to assure you even if you can t believe it that many very many of the stage people are workers with abiding ambitions just the same as the man who wants to be president or the grocery clerk who wants a home in flatbush or a lady who is anxious to flop out of the count pan into the prince fire and i hope i may be allowed to say without chipping into the contribution basket that they often move in a mysterious way their wonders to perform but listen at the first performance of mice will play in new york at the westphalia no hams alluded to theatre winona cherry was nervous when she fired at the photograph of the eastern beauty on the mantel the bullet instead of penetrating the photo and then striking the disk went into the lower left side of bob hart s neck not expecting to get it there hart collapsed neatly while cherry fainted in a most artistic manner the audience surmising that they viewed a comedy instead of a tragedy in which the principals were married or reconciled applauded with great enjoyment the cool head who always graces such occasions rang the curtain down and two platoons of scene shifters respectively and more or less respectfully removed hart cherry from the stage the next turn went on and all went as merry as an alimony bell the stage hands found a young doctor at the stage entrance who was waiting for a patient with a decoction of am b ty roses the doctor examined hart carefully and laughed heartily no headlines for you old sport was his diagnosis if it had been two inches to the left it would have undermined the carotid artery as far as the red front drug store in flatbush and back again as it is you just get the property man to bind it up with a flounce torn from any one of the girls valenciennes and go home and get it dressed by the parlor floor practitioner on your block and you ll be all right excuse me i ve got a serious case outside to look after after that bob hart looked up and felt better and then to where he lay came vincente the tramp juggler great in his line vincente a solemn man from brattleboro vt named sam griggs at home sent toys and maple sugar home to two small daughters from every town he played vincente had moved on the same circuits with hart cherry and was their peripatetic friend bob said vincente in his serious way i m glad it s no worse the little lady is wild about you who asked hart cherry said the juggler we didn t know how bad you were hurt and we kept her away it s taking the manager and three girls to hold her it was an accident of course said hart cherry s all right she wasn t feeling in good trim or she couldn t have done it there s no hard feelings she s strictly business the doctor says i ll be on the job again in three days don t let her worry man said sam griggs severely puckering his old smooth lined face are you a chess automaton or a human pincushion cherry s crying her heart out for you calling bob bob every second with them holding her hands and keeping her from coming to you what s the matter with her asked hart with wide open eyes the sketch ll go on again in three days i m not hurt bad the doctor says she won t lose out half a

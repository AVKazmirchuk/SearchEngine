so at once he wore his green silk tie through a topaz ring and he carried a cane made of the vertebrae of a shark judson tate accosted me with some large and casual inquiries about the city s streets and hotels in the manner of one who had but for the moment forgotten the trifling details i could think of no reason for disparaging my own quiet hotel in the downtown district so the mid morning of the night found us already victualed and drinked at my expense and ready to be chaired and tobaccoed in a quiet corner of the lobby there was something on judson tate s mind and such as it was he tried to convey it to me already he had accepted me as his friend and when i looked at his great snuff brown first mate s hand with which he brought emphasis to his periods within six inches of my nose i wondered if by any chance he was as sudden in conceiving enmity against strangers when this man began to talk i perceived in him a certain power his voice was a persuasive instrument upon which he played with a somewhat specious but effective art he did not try to make you forget his ugliness he flaunted it in your face and made it part of the charm of his speech shutting your eyes you would have trailed after this rat catcher s pipes at least to the walls of hamelin beyond that you would have had to be more childish to follow but let him play his own tune to the words set down so that if all is too dull the art of music may bear the blame women said judson tate are mysterious creatures my spirits sank i was not there to listen to such a world old hypothesis to such a time worn long ago refuted bald feeble illogical vicious patent sophistry to an ancient baseless wearisome ragged unfounded insidious falsehood originated by women themselves and by them insinuated foisted thrust spread and ingeniously promulgated into the ears of mankind by underhanded secret and deceptive methods for the purpose of augmenting furthering and reinforcing their own charms and designs oh i don t know said i vernacularly have you ever heard of oratama he asked possibly i answered i seem to recall a toe dancer or a suburban addition or was it a perfume of some such name it is a town said judson tate on the coast of a foreign country of which you know nothing and could understand less it is a country governed by a dictator and controlled by revolutions and insubordination it was there that a great life drama was played with judson tate the homeliest man in america and fergus mcmahan the handsomest adventurer in history or fiction and senorita anabela zamora the beautiful daughter of the alcalde of oratama as chief actors and another thing nowhere else on the globe except in the department of trienta y tres in uruguay does the chuchula plant grow the products of the country i speak of are valuable woods dyestuffs gold rubber ivory and cocoa i was not aware said i that south america produced any ivory there you are twice mistaken said judson tate distributing the words over at least an octave of his wonderful voice i did not say that the country i spoke of was in south america i must be careful my dear man i have been in politics there you know but even so i have played chess against its president with a set carved from the nasal bones of the tapir one of our native specimens of the order of perissodactyle ungulates inhabiting the cordilleras which was as pretty ivory as you would care to see but is was of romance and adventure and the ways of women that was i going to tell you and not of zoological animals for fifteen years i was the ruling power behind old sancho benavides the royal high thumbscrew of the republic you ve seen his picture in the papers a mushy black man with whiskers like the notes on a swiss music box cylinder and a scroll in his right hand like the ones they write births on in the family bible well that chocolate potentate used to be the biggest item of interest anywhere between the colour line and the parallels of latitude it was three throws horses whether he was to wind up in the hall of fame or the bureau of combustibles he d have been sure called the roosevelt of the southern continent if it hadn t been that grover cleveland was president at the time he d hold office a couple of terms then he d sit out for a hand always after appointing his own successor for the interims but it was not benavides the liberator who was making all this fame for himself not him it was judson tate benavides was only the chip over the bug i gave him the tip when to declare war and increase import duties and wear his state trousers but that wasn t what i wanted to tell you how did i get to be it i ll tell you because i m the most gifted talker that ever made vocal sounds since adam first opened his eyes pushed aside the smelling salts and asked where am i as you observe i am about the ugliest man you ever saw outside the gallery of photographs of the new england early christian scientists so at an early age i perceived that what i lacked in looks i must make up in eloquence that i ve done i get what i go after as the back stop and still small voice of old benavides i made all the great historical powers behind the throne such as talleyrand mrs de pompadour and loeb look as small as the minority report of

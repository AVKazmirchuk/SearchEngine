went to some trouble to try to prove my theory to my friend the weather bureau and the season had conspired to make the argument worthy of an able advocate the city seemed stretched on a broiler directly above the furnaces of avernus there was a kind of tepid gayety afoot and awheel in the boulevards mainly evinced by languid men strolling about in straw hats and evening clothes and rows of idle taxicabs with their flags up looking like a blockaded fourth of july procession the hotels kept up a specious brilliancy and hospitable outlook but inside one saw vast empty caverns and the footrails at the bars gleamed brightly from long disacquaintance with the sole leather of customers in the cross town streets the steps of the old brownstone houses were swarming with stoopers that motley race hailing from sky light room and basement bringing out their straw doorstep mats to sit and fill the air with strange noises and opinions north and i dined on the top of a hotel and here for a few minutes i thought i had made a score an east wind almost cool blew across the roofless roof a capable orchestra concealed in a bower of wistaria played with sufficient judgment to make the art of music probable and the art of conversation possible some ladies in reproachless summer gowns at other tables gave animation and color to the scene and an excellent dinner mainly from the refrigerator seemed to successfully back my judgment as to summer resorts but north grumbled all during the meal and cursed his lawyers and prated so of his confounded camp in the woods that i began to wish he would go back there and leave me in my peaceful city retreat after dining we went to a roof garden vaudeville that was being much praised there we found a good bill an artificially cooled atmosphere cold drinks prompt service and a gay well dressed audience north was bored if this isn t comfortable enough for you on the hottest august night for five years i said a little sarcastically you might think about the kids down in delancey and hester streets lying out on the fire escapes with their tongues hanging out trying to get a breath of air that hasn t been fried on both sides the contrast might increase your enjoyment don t talk socialism said north i gave five hundred dollars to the free ice fund on the first of may i m contrasting these stale artificial hollow wearisome amusements with the enjoyment a man can get in the woods you should see the firs and pines do skirt dances during a storm and lie down flat and drink out of a mountain branch at the end of a day s tramp after the deer that s the only way to spend a summer get out and live with nature i agree with you absolutely said i with emphasis for one moment i had relaxed my vigilance and had spoken my true sentiments north looked at me long and curiously then why in the name of pan and apollo he asked have you been singing this deceitful paean to summer in town i suppose i looked my guilt ha said north i see may i ask her name annie ashton said i simply she played nannette in binkley bing s production of the silver cord she is to have a better part next season take me to see her said north miss ashton lived with her mother in a small hotel they were out of the west and had a little money that bridged the seasons as press agent of binkley bing i had tried to keep her before the public as robert james vandiver i had hoped to withdraw her for if ever one was made to keep company with said vandiver and smell the salt breeze on the south shore of long island and listen to the ducks quack in the watches of the night it was the ashton set forth above but she had a soul above ducks above nightingales aye even above birds of paradise she was very beautiful with quiet ways and seemed genuine she had both taste and talent for the stage and she liked to stay at home and read and make caps for her mother she was unvaryingly kind and friendly with binkley bing s press agent since the theatre had closed she had allowed mr vandiver to call in an unofficial role i had often spoken to her of my friend spencer grenville north and so as it was early the first turn of the vaudeville being not yet over we left to find a telephone miss ashton would be very glad to see mr vandiver and mr north we found her fitting a new cap on her mother i never saw her look more charming north made himself disagreeably entertaining he was a good talker and had a way with him besides he had two ten or thirty millions i ve for gotten which i incautiously admired the mother s cap whereupon she brought out her store of a dozen or two and i took a course in edgings and frills even though annie s fingers had pinked or ruched or hemmed or whatever you do to em they palled upon me and i could hear north drivelling to annie about his odious adirondack camp two days after that i saw north in his motor car with miss ashton and her mother on the next afternoon he dropped in on me bobby said he this old burg isn t such a bad proposition in the summer time after all since i ve keen knocking around it looks better to me there are some first rate musical comedies and light operas on the roofs and in the outdoor gardens and if you hunt up the right places and stick to soft drinks you can

unsuccessful on arriving in washington which city i instantly recognized from reading the history of george i left the car so hastily that i forgot to fee mr pullman s representative i went immediately to the capitol in a spirit of jeu d esprit i had had made a globular representation of a rolling stone it was of wood painted a dark color and about the size of a small cannon ball i had attached to it a twisted pendant about three inches long to indicate moss i had resolved to use this in place of a card thinking people would readily recognize it as an emblem of my paper i had studied the arrangement of the capitol and walked directly to mr cleveland s private office i met a servant in the hall and held up my card to him smilingly i saw his hair rise on his head and he ran like a deer to the door and lying down rolled down the long flight of steps into the yard ah said i to myself he is one of our delinquent subscribers a little farther along i met the president s private secretary who had been writing a tariff letter and cleaning a duck gun for mr cleveland when i showed him the emblem of my paper he sprang out of a high window into a hothouse filled with rare flowers this somewhat surprised me i examined myself my hat was on straight and there was nothing at all alarming about my appearance i went into the president s private office he was alone he was conversing with tom ochiltree mr ochiltree saw my little sphere and with a loud scream rushed out of the room president cleveland slowly turned his eyes upon me he also saw what i had in my hand and said in a husky voice wait a moment please he searched his coat pocket and presently found a piece of paper on which some words were written he laid this on his desk and rose to his feet raised one hand above him and said in deep tones i die for free trade my country and and all that sort of thing i saw him jerk a string and a camera snapped on another table taking our picture as we stood don t die in the house mr president i said go over into the senate chamber peace murderer he said let your bomb do its deadly work i m no bum i said with spirit i represent the rolling stone of austin texas and this i hold in my hand does the same thing but it seems unsuccessfully the president sank back in his chair greatly relieved i thought you were a dynamiter he said let me see texas texas he walked to a large wall map of the united states and placing his finger thereon at about the location of idaho ran it down in a zigzag doubtful way until he reached texas oh yes here it is i have so many things on my mind i sometimes forget what i should know well let s see texas oh yes that s the state where ida wells and a lot of colored people lynched a socialist named hogg for raising a riot at a camp meeting so you are from texas i know a man from texas named dave culberson how is dave and his family has dave got any children he has a boy in austin i said working around the capitol who is president of texas now i don t exactly oh excuse me i forgot again i thought i heard some talk of its having been made a republic again now mr cleveland i said you answer some of my questions a curious film came over the president s eyes he sat stiffly in his chair like an automaton proceed he said what do you think of the political future of this country i will state that political exigencies demand emergentistical promptitude and while the united states is indissoluble in conception and invisible in intent treason and internecine disagreement have ruptured the consanguinity of patriotism and one moment mr president i interrupted would you mind changing that cylinder i could have gotten all that from the american press association if i had wanted plate matter do you wear flannels what is your favorite poet brand of catsup bird flower and what are you going to do when you are out of a job young man said mr cleveland sternly you are going a little too far my private affairs do not concern the public i begged his pardon and he recovered his good humor in a moment you texans have a great representative in senator mills he said i think the greatest two speeches i ever heard were his address before the senate advocating the removal of the tariff on salt and increasing it on chloride of sodium tom ochiltree is also from our state i said oh no he isn t you must be mistaken replied mr cleveland for he says he is i really must go down to texas some time and see the state i want to go up into the panhandle and see if it is really shaped like it is on the map well i must be going said i when you get back to texas said the president rising you must write to me your visit has awakened in me quite an interest in your state which i fear i have not given the attention it deserves there are many historical and otherwise interesting places that you have revived in my recollection the alamo where davy jones fell goliad sam houston s surrender to montezuma the petrified boom found near austin five cent cotton and the siamese democratic platform born in dallas i should so much like to see the gals in galveston and go to the wake in waco i am glad

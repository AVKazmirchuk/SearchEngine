most meagre comfort lacked the concentrated wretchedness of the more populous byways at a segregated two story house father rogan halted and mounted the steps with the confidence of a familiar visitor he ushered lorison into a narrow hallway faintly lighted by a cobwebbed hanging lamp almost immediately a door to the right opened and a dingy irish woman protruded her head good evening to ye mistress geehan said the priest unconsciously it seemed falling into a delicately flavoured brogue and is it yourself can tell me if norah has gone out again the night maybe oh it s yer blissid reverence sure and i can tell ye the same the purty darlin wint out as usual but a bit later and she says mother geehan says she it s me last noight out praise the saints this noight is and oh yer reverence the swate beautiful drame of a dress she had this toime white satin and silk and ribbons and lace about the neck and arrums twas a sin yer reverence the gold was spint upon it the priest heard lorison catch his breath painfully and a faint smile flickered across his own clean cut mouth well then mistress geehan said he i ll just step upstairs and see the bit boy for a minute and i ll take this gentleman up with me he s awake thin said the woman i ve just come down from sitting wid him the last hour tilling him fine shtories of ould county tyrone tis a greedy gos soon it is yer riverence for me shtories small the doubt said father rogan there s no rocking would put him to slape the quicker i m thinking amid the woman s shrill protest against the retort the two men ascended the steep stairway the priest pushed open the door of a room near its top is that you already sister drawled a sweet childish voice from the darkness it s only ould father denny come to see ye darlin and a foine gentleman i ve brought to make ye a gr r and call and ye resaves us fast aslape in bed shame on yez manners oh father denny is that you i m glad and will you light the lamp please it s on the table by the door and quit talking like mother geehan father denny the priest lit the lamp and lorison saw a tiny towsled haired boy with a thin delicate face sitting up in a small bed in a corner quickly also his rapid glance con sidered the room and its contents it was furnished with more than comfort and its adornments plainly indicated a woman s discerning taste an open door beyond revealed the blackness of an adjoining room s interior the boy clutched both of father rogan s hands i m so glad you came he said but why did you come in the night did sister send you off wid ye am i to be sint about at me age as was terence mcshane of ballymahone i come on me own r r responsibility lorison had also advanced to the boy s bedside he was fond of children and the wee fellow laving himself down to sleep alone ill that dark room stirred his heart aren t you afraid little man he asked stooping down beside him sometimes answered the boy with a shy smile when the rats make too much noise but nearly every night when sister goes out molt her geehan stays a while with me and tells me funny stories i m not often afraid sir this brave little gentleman said father rogan is a scholar of mine every day from half past six to half past eight when sister comes for him he stops in my study and we find out what s in the inside of books he knows multiplication division and fractions and he s troubling me to begin wid the chronicles of ciaran of clonmaciioise corurac mccullenan and cuan o loc hain the gr r reat irish histhorians the boy was evidently accustomed to the priest s celtic pleasantries a little appreciative grin was all the attention the insin nation of pedantry received lorison to have saved his life could not have put to the child one of those vital questions that were wildly beating about unanswered in his own brain the little fellow was very like norah he had the same shining hair and candid eyes oh father denny cried the boy suddenly i forgot to tell you sister is not going away at night any more she told me so when she kissed me good night as she was leaving and she said she was so happy and then she cried wasn t that queer but i m glad aren t you yes lad and now ye omadhaun go to sleep and say good night we must be going which shall i do first father denny faith he s caught me again wait till i get the sassenach into the annals of tageruach the hagiographer i ll give him enough of the irish idiom to make him more respectful the light was out and the small brave voice bidding them good night from the dark room they groped downstairs and tore away from the garrulity of mother geehan again the priest steered them through the dim ways but this time in another direction his conductor was serenely silent and lorison followed his example to the extent of seldom speaking serene he could not be his heart beat suffocatingly in his breast the following of this blind menacing trail was pregnant with he knew not what humiliating revelation to be delivered at its end they came into a more pretentious street where trade it could be surmised flourished by day and again the priest paused this time before a lofty building whose great doors and windows in the lowest floor were carefully shuttered and barred its higher apertures were dark save in the third story the windows of which were bril liantly lighted lorison s ear caught a distant regular pleasing thrumming as of music above they stood at an angle of the building up along the side nearest them mounted an iron stairway at its top was an upright illuminated parallelogram father rogan had stopped and stood musing i will say this much he remarked thoughtfully i believe you to be a better man than you think yourself to be and a better man than i thought some hours ago but do not take this he added with a smile as much praise i promised you a possible deliverance from an unhappy perplexity i will have to modify that promise i can only remove the mystery that enhanced that per plexity your deliverance depends upon yourself come he led his companion up the stairway halfway up lorison caught him by the sleeve remember he gasped i love that woman you desired to know i go on the priest reached the landing at the top of the stairway lorison behind him saw that the illuminated space was the glass upper half of a door opening into the lighted room the rhythmic music increased as they neared it the stairs shook with the mellow vibrations lorison stopped breathing when he set foot upon the highest step for the priest stood aside and motioned him to look through the glass of the door his eye accustomed to the darkness met first a blind ing glare and then he made out the faces and forms of many people amid an extravagant display of splendid robings billowy laces brilliant hued finery ribbons silks and misty drapery and then he caught the mean ing of that jarring hum and he saw the tired pale happy face of his wife bending as were a score of others over her sewing machine toiling toiling here was the folly she pursued and the end of his quest but not his deliverance though even then remorse struck him his shamed soul fluttered once more before it retired to make room for the other and better one for to temper his thrill of joy the shine of the satin and the glimmer of ornaments recalled the disturbing figure of the bespangled amazon and the base duplicate histories it by the glare of footlights and stolen diamonds it is past the wisdom of him who only sets the scenes either to praise or blame the man but this time his love over came his scruples he took a quick step and reached out his hand for the doorknob father rogan was quicker to arrest it and draw him back you use my trust in you queerly said the priest sternly what are you about to do i am going to my wife said lorison let me pass listen said the priest holding him firmly by the arm i am about to put you in possession of a piece of knowledge of which thus far you have scarcely proved deserving i do not think you ever will but i will not dwell upon that you see in that room the woman you married working for a frugal living for herself and a generous comfort for an idolized brother this building belongs to the chief costumer of the city for months the advance orders for the coming mardi gras festivals have kept the work going day and night i myself secured employment here for norah she toils here each night from nine o clock until daylight and besides carries home with her some of the finer costumes requiring more delicate needlework and works there part of the day somehow you two have remained strangely ignorant of each other s lives are you convinced now that your wife is not walking the streets let me go to her cried lorison again struggling and beg her forgiveness sir said the priest do you owe me nothing be quiet it seems so often that heaven lets fall its choicest gifts into hands that must be taught to hold them listen again you forgot that repentant sin must not comprom ise but look up for redemption to the purest and best you went to her with the fine spun sophistry that peace could be found in a mutual guilt and she fearful of losing what her heart so craved thought it worth the price to buy it with a desperate pure beautiful lie i have known her since the day she was born she is as innocent and unsullied in life and deed as a holy saint in that lowly street where she dwells she first saw the light and she has lived there ever since spending her days in generous self sacrifice for others och ye spalpeen continued father rogan raising his finger in kindly anger at lorison what for i wonder could she be after making a fool of hersilf and shamin her swate soul with lies for the like of you sir said lorison trembling say what you please of me doubt it as you must i will yet prove my gratitude to you and my devotion to her but let me speak to her once now let me kneel for just one moment at her feet and tut tut said the priest how many acts of a love drama do you think an old bookworm like me capable of witnessing besides what kind of figures do we cut spying upon the mysteries of midnight millinery go to meet your wife to morrow as she ordered you and obey her thereafter and maybe some time i shall get forgive ness for the part i have played in this night s work off wid yez down the shtairs now tis late and an ould man like me should be takin his rest madame bo peep of the ranches aunt ellen said octavia cheerfully as she threw her black kid gloves carefully at the dignified persian cat on the window seat i m a pauper you are so extreme in your statements octavia dear said aunt ellen mildly looking up from her paper if you find yourself temporarily in need of some small change for bonbons you will find my purse in the drawer of the writing desk octavia beaupree removed her hat and seated herself on a footstool near her aunt s chair clasping her hands about her knees her slim and flexible figure clad in a modish mourning costume accommodated itself easily and gracefully to the trying position her bright and youthful face with its pair of sparkling life enamoured eyes tried to compose itself to the seriousness that the occasion seemed to demand you good auntie it isn t a case of bonbons it is abject staring unpicturesque poverty with ready made clothes gasolined gloves and probably one o clock dinners all waiting with the traditional wolf at the door i ve just come from my lawyer auntie and please ma am i ain t got nothink t all flowers lady buttonhole gentleman pencils sir three for five to help a poor widow do i do it nicely auntie or as a bread winner accomplishment were my lessons in elocution entirely wasted do be serious my dear said aunt ellen letting her paper fall to the floor long enough to tell me what you mean colonel beaupree s estate colonel beaupree s estate interrupted octavia emphasizing her words with appropriate dramatic ges tures is of spanish castellar architecture colonel beaupree s resources are wind colonel beaupree s stocks are water colonel beaupree s income is all in the statement lacks the legal technicalities to which i have been listening for an hour but that is what it means when translated octavia aunt ellen was now visibly possessed by consternation i can hardly believe it and it was the impression that he was worth a million and the de peysters themselves introduced him octavia rippled out a laugh and then became properly grave de mortuis nil auntie not even the rest of it the dear old colonel what a gold brick he was after all i paid for my bargain fairly i m all here am i not items eyes fingers toes youth old family unques tionable position in society as called for in the contract no wild cat stock here octavia picked up the morning paper from the floor but i m not going to squeal isn t that what they call it when you rail at fortune because you ve lost the game she turned the pages of the paper calmly stock market no use for that society s doings that s done here is my page the wish column a van dresser could not be said to want for anything of course chamber maids cooks canvassers stenographers dear said aunt ellen with a little tremor in her voice please do not talk in that way even if your affairs are in so unfortunate a condition there is my three thousand octavia sprang up lithely and deposited a smart kiss on the delicate cheek of the prim little elderly maid blessed auntie your three thousand is just sufficient to insure your hyson to be free from willow leaves and keep the persian in sterilized cream i know i d be welcome but i prefer to strike bottom like beelzebub rather than hang around like the peri listening to the music from the side entrance i m going to earn my own living there s nothing else to do i m a oh oh oh i had forgotten there s one thing saved from the wreck it s a corral no a ranch in let me see texas an asset dear old mr bannister called it how pleased he was to show me something he could describe as unencumbered i ve a description of it among those stupid papers he made me bring away with me from his office i ll try to find it octavia found her shopping bag and drew from it a long envelope filled with typewritten documents a ranch in texas sighed aunt ellen it sounds to me more like a liability than an asset those are the places where the centipedes are found and cowboys and fandangos the rancho de las sombras read octavia from a sheet of violently purple typewriting is situated one hundred and ten miles southeast of san antonio and thirty eight miles from its nearest railroad station nopal on the i and g n ranch consists of acres of well watered land with title conferred by state patents and twenty two sections or acres partly under yearly running lease and partly bought under state s twenty year purchase act eight thousand graded merino sheep with the necessary equipment of horses vehicles and general ranch paraphernalia ranch house built of brick with six rooms comfortably furnished according to the requirements of the climate all within a strong barbed wire fence the present ranch manager seems to be competent and reliable and is rapidly placing upon a paying basis a business that in other hands had been allowed to suffer from neglect and misconduct this property was secured by colonel beaupree in a deal with a western irrigation syndicate and the title to it seems to be perfect with careful management and the natural increase of land values it ought to be made the foundation for a comfortable fortune for its owner when octavia ceased reading aunt ellen uttered something as near a sniff as her breeding permitted the prospectus she said with uncompromising metropolitan suspicion doesn t mention the centipedes or the indians and you never did like mutton octavia i don t see what advantage you can derive from this desert but octavia was in a trance her eyes were steadily regarding something quite beyond their focus her lips were parted and her face was lighted by the kindling furor of the explorer the ardent stirring disquiet of the adventurer suddenly she clasped her hands together exultantly the problem solves itself auntie she cried i m going to that ranch i m going to live on it i m going to learn to like mutton and even concede the good qualities of centipedes at a respectful distance it s just what i need it s a new life that comes when my old one is just ending it s a release auntie it isn t a narrow ing think of the gallops over those leagues of prairies with the wind tugging at the roots of your hair the com ing close to the earth and learning over again the stories of the growing grass and the little wild flowers without names glorious is what it will be shall i be a shepherdess with a watteau hat and a crook to keep the bad wolves from the lambs or a typical western ranch girl with short hair like the pictures of her in the sunday papers i think the latter and they ll have my picture too with the wild cats i ve slain single handed hanging from my saddle horn from the four hundred to the flocks is the way they ll headline it and they ll print photographs of the old van dresser mansion and the church where i was married they won t have my picture but they ll get an artist to draw it i ll be wild and woolly and i ll grow my own wool octavia aunt ellen condensed into the one word all the protests she was unable to utter don t say a word auntie i m going i ll see the sky at night fit down on the world like a big butter dish cover and i ll make friends again with the stars that i haven t had a chat with since i was a wee child i wish to go i m tired of all this i m glad i haven t any money i could bless colonel beaupree for that ranch and forgive him for all his bubbles what if the life will be rough and lonely i i deserve it i shut my heart to everything except that miserable ambition i oh i wish to go away and forget forget octavia swerved suddenly to her knees laid her flushed face in her aunt s lap and shook with turbulent sobs aunt ellen bent over her and smoothed the coppery brown hair i didn t know she said gently i didn t know that who was it dear when mrs octavia beaupree n e van dresser stepped from the train at nopal her manner lost for the moment some of that easy certitude which had always marked her movements the town was of recent estab lishment and seemed to have been hastily constructed of undressed lumber and flapping canvas the element that had congregated about the station though not offensively demonstrative was clearly composed of citizens accustomed to and prepared for rude alarms octavia stood on the platform against the telegraph office and attempted to choose by intuition from the swaggering straggling string of loungers the manager of the rancho de las sombras who had been instructed by mr bannister to meet her there that tall serious looking elderly man in the blue flannel shirt and white tie she thought must be he but no he passed by removing his gaze from the lady as hers rested on him according to the southern custom the manager she thought with some impatience at being kept waiting should have no difficulty in selecting her young women wearing the most recent thing in ash coloured travelling suits were not so plentiful in nopal thus keeping a speculative watch on all persons of possible managerial aspect octavia with a catching breath and a start of surprise suddenly became aware of teddy westlake hurrying along the platform in the direction of the train of teddy westlake or his sun browned ghost in cheviot boots and leather girdled hat theodore westlake jr amateur polo almost champion all round butterfly and cumberer of the soil but a broader surer more emphasized and determined teddy than the one she had known a year ago when last she saw him he perceived octavia at almost the same time deflected his course and steered for her in his old straightforward way something like awe came upon her as the strange ness of his metamorphosis was brought into closer range the rich red brown of his complexion brought out so vividly his straw coloured mustache and steel gray eyes he seemed more grown up and somehow farther away but when he spoke the old boyish teddy came back again they had been friends from childhood why tave he exclaimed unable to reduce his perplexity to coherence how what when where train said octavia necessity ten minutes ago home your complexion s gone teddy now how what when where i m working down here said teddy he cast side glances about the station as one does who tries to combine politeness with duty you didn t notice on the train he asked an old lady with gray curls and a poodle who occupied two seats with her bundles and quarrelled with the conductor did you i think not answered octavia reflecting and you haven t by any chance noticed a big gray mustached man in a blue shirt and six shooters with little flakes of merino wool sticking in his hair have you lots of em said teddy with symptoms of mental delirium under the strain do you happen to know any such individual no the description is imaginary is your interest in the old lady whom you describe a personal one never saw her in my life she s painted entirely from fancy she owns the little piece of property where i earn my bread and butter the rancho de las sombras i drove up to meet her according to arrangement with her lawyer octavia leaned against the wall of the telegraph office was this possible and didn t he know are you the manager of that ranch she asked weakly i am said teddy with pride i am mrs beaupree said octavia faintly but my hair never would curl and i was polite to the conductor for a moment that strange grown up look came back and removed teddy miles away from her i hope you ll excuse me he said rather awkwardly you see i ve been down here in the chaparral a year i hadn t heard give me your checks please and i ll have your traps loaded into the wagon jos will follow with them we travel ahead in the buckboard seated by teddy in a feather weight buckboard behind a pair of wild cream coloured spanish ponies octavia abandoned all thought for the exhilaration of the present they swept out of the little town and down the level road toward the south soon the road dwindled and dis appeared and they struck across a world carpeted with an endless reach of curly mesquite grass the wheels made no sound the tireless ponies bounded ahead at an unbroken gallop the temperate wind made fragrant by thousands of acres of blue and yellow wild flowers roared gloriously in their ears the motion was a rial ecstatic with a thrilling sense of perpetuity in its effect octavia sat silent possessed by a feeling of elemental sensual bliss teddy seemed to be wrestling with some internal problem i m going to call you madama he announced as the result of his labours that is what the mexicans will call you they re nearly all mexicans on the ranch you know that seems to me about the proper thing very well mr westlake said octavia primly oh now said teddy in some consternation that s carrying the thing too far isn t it don t worry me with your beastly etiquette i m just beginning to live don t remind me of anything artificial if only this air could be bottled this much alone is worth coming for oh look i there goes a deer jack rabbit said teddy without turning his head could i might i drive suggested octavia pant ing with rose tinted cheeks and the eye of an eager child on one condition could i might i smoke forever cried octavia taking the lines with solemn joy how shall i know which way to drive keep her sou by sou east and all sail set you see that black speck on the horizon under that lowermost gulf cloud that s a group of live oaks and a land mark steer halfway between that and the little hill to the left i ll recite you the whole code of driving rules for the texas prairies keep the reins from under the horses feet and swear at em frequent i m too happy to swear ted oh why do people buy yachts or travel in palace cars when a buckboard and a pair of plugs and a spring morning like this can satisfy all desire now i ll ask you protested teddy who was futilely striking match after match on the dashboard not to call those denizens of the air plugs they can kick out a hundred miles between daylight and dark at last he succeeded in snatching a light for his cigar from the flame held in the hollow of his hands room said octavia intensely that s what produces the effect i know now what i ve wanted scope range room smoking room said teddy unsentimentally i love to smoke in a buckboard the wind blows the smoke into you and out again it saves exertion the two fell so naturally into their old time goodfellow ship that it was only by degrees that a sense of the strange ness of the new relations between them came to be felt madama said teddy wonderingly however did you get it into your bead to cut the crowd and come down here is it a fad now among the upper classes to trot off to sheep ranches instead of to newport i was broke teddy said octavia sweetly with her interest centred upon steering safely between a spanish dagger plant and a clump of chaparral i haven t a thing in the world but this ranch not even any other home to go to come now said teddy anxiously but ineredu lously you don t mean it when my husband said octavia with a shy slurring of the word died three months ago i thought i had a reasonable amount of the world s goods his lawyer exploded that theory in a sixty minute fully illustrated lecture i took to the sheep as a last resort do you happen to know of any fashionable caprice among the gilded youth of manhattan that induces them to abandon polo and club windows to become managers of sheep ranches it s easily explained in my case responded teddy promptly i had to go to work i couldn t have earned my board in new york so i chummed a while with old sandford one of the syndicate that owned the ranch before colonel beaupree bought it and got a place down here i wasn t manager at first i jogged around on ponies and studied the business in detail until i got all the points in my head i saw where it was losing and what the reme dies were and then sandford put me in charge i get a hundred dollars a month and i earn it poor teddy said octavia with a smile you needn t i like it i save half my wages and i m as hard as a water plug it beats polo will it furnish bread and tea and jam for another out cast from civilization the spring shearing said the manager just cleaned up a deficit in last year s business wastefulness and inattention have been the rule heretofore the autumn clip will leave a small profit over all expenses next year there will be jam when about four o clock in the afternoon the ponies rounded a gentle brush covered hill and then swooped like a double cream coloured cyclone upon the rancho de las sombras octavia gave a little cry of delight a lordly grove of magnificent live oaks cast an area of grateful cool shade whence the ranch had drawn its name de las sombras of the shadows the house of red brick one story ran low and long beneath the trees through its middle dividing its six rooms in half extended a broad arched passageway picturesque with flowering cactus and hanging red earthern jars a gallery low and broad encircled the building vines climbed about it and the adjacent ground was for a space covered with transplanted grass and shrubs a little lake long and narrow glimmered in the sun at the rear further away stood the shacks of the mexican workers the corrals wool sheds and shearing pens to the right lay the low hills splattered with dark patches of chaparral to the left the unbounded green prairie blending against the blue heavens it s a home teddy said octavia breathlessly that s what it is it s a home not so bad for a sheep ranch admitted teddy with excusable pride i ve been tinkering on it at odd times a mexican youth sprang from somewhere in the grass and took charge of the creams the mistress and the manager entered the house here s mrs macintyre said teddy as a placid neat elderly lady came out upon the gallery to meet them mrs mac here s the boss very likely she will be wanting a hunk of ham and a dish of beans after her drive mrs macintyre the housekeeper as much a fixture on the place as the lake or the live oaks received the imputation of the ranch s resources of refreshment with mild indignation and was about to give it utterance when octavia spoke oh mrs macintyre don t apologize for teddy yes i call him teddy so does every one whom he hasn t duped into taking him seriously you see we used to cut paper dolls and play jackstraws together ages ago no one minds what he says no said teddy no one minds what he says just so he doesn t do it again octavia cast one of those subtle sidelong glances toward him from beneath her lowered eyelids a glance that teddy used to describe as an upper cut but there was nothing in his ingenuous weather tanned face to warrant a suspicion that he was making an allusion nothing beyond a doubt thought octavia he had forgotten mr westlake likes his fun said mrs maclntyre as she conducted octavia to her rooms but she added loyally people around here usually pay attention to what he says when he talks in earnest i don t know what would have become of this place without him two rooms at the east end of the house had been arranged for the occupancy of the ranch s mistress when she entered them a slight dismay seized her at their bare appearance and the scantiness of their furniture but she quickly reflected that the climate was a semi tropical one and was moved to appreciation of the well conceived efforts to conform to it the sashes had already been removed from the big windows and white curtains waved in the gulf breeze that streamed through the wide jalousies the bare floor was amply strewn with cool rugs the chairs were inviting deep dreamy willows the walls were papered with a light cheerful olive one whole side of her sitting room was covered with books on smooth unpainted pine shelves she flew to these at once before her was a well selected library she caught glimpses of titles of volumes of fiction and travel not yet seasoned from the dampness of the press presently recollecting that she was now in a wilderness given over to mutton centipedes and privations the incongruity of these luxuries struck her and with intuitive feminine suspicion she began turning to the fly leaves of volume after volume upon each one was inscribed in fluent characters the name of theodore westlake jr octavia fatigued by her long journey retired early that night lying upon her white cool bed she rested deliciously but sleep coquetted long with her she listened to faint noises whose strangeness kept her faculties on the alert the fractious yelping of the coyotes the ceaseless low symphony of the wind the distant booming of the frogs about the lake the lamentation of a concertina in the mexicans quarters there were many conflicting feelings in her heart thankfulness and rebellion peace and disquietude loneliness and a sense of protecting care happiness and an old haunting pain she did what any other woman would have done sought relief in a wholesome tide of unreasonable tears and her last words murmured to herself before slumber capitulating came softly to woo her were he has forgotten the manager of the rancho de las sombras was no dilettante he was a hustler he was generally up mounted and away of mornings before the rest of the household were awake making the rounds of the flocks and camps this was the duty of the majordomo a stately old mexican with a princely air and manner but teddy seemed to have a great deal of confidence in his own eyesight except in the busy seasons he nearly always returned to the ranch to breakfast at eight o clock with octavia and mrs maclntyre at the little table set in the central hallway bringing with him a tonic and breezy cheerfulness full of the health and flavour of the prairies a few days after octavia s arrival he made her get out one of her riding skirts and curtail it to a shortness demanded by the chaparral brakes with some misgivings she donned this and the pair of buckskin leggings he prescribed in addition and mounted upon a dancing pony rode with him to view her posses sions he showed her everything the flocks of ewes muttons and grazing lambs the dipping vats the shearing pens the uncouth merino rams in their little pasture the water tanks i prepared against the summer drought giving account of his stewardship with a boyish enthus siasm that never flagged where was the old teddy that she knew so well this side of him was the same and it was a side that pleased her but this was all she ever saw of him now where was his sentimentality those old varying moods of impetuous love making of fanciful quixotic devotion of heart breaking gloom of alternating absurd tenderness and haughty dignity his nature had been a sensitive one his temperament bordering closely on the artistic she knew that besides being a follower of fashion and its fads and sports he had cultivated tastes of a finer nature he had written things he had tampered with colours he was something of a student in certain branches of art and once she had been admitted to all his aspirations and thoughts but now and she could not avoid the con clusion teddy had barricaded against her every side of himself except one the side that showed the manager of the rancho de las sombras and a jolly chum who had forgiven and forgotten queerly enough the words of mr bannister s description of her property came into her mind all inclosed within a strong barbed wire fence teddy s fenced too said octavia to herself it was not difficult for her to reason out the cause of his fortifications it had originated one night at the hammersmiths ball it occurred at a time soon after she had decided to accept colonel beaupree and his million which was no more than her looks and the entr e she held to the inner circles were worth teddy had proposed with all his impetuosity and fire and she looked him straight in the eyes an said coldly and finally never let me hear any such silly nonsense from you again you won t said teddy with an expression around his mouth and now teddy was inclosed within a strong barbed wire fence it was on this first ride of inspection that teddy was seized by the inspiration that suggested the name of mother goose s heroine and he at once bestowed it upon octavia the idea supported by both a similarity of names and identity of occupations seemed to strike him as a peculiarly happy one and he never tired of using it the mexicans on the ranch also took up the name adding another syllable to accommodate their lingual incapacity for the final p gravely referring to her as la madama bo peepy eventually it spread and madame bo peep s ranch was as often mentioned as the rancho de las sombras came the long hot season from may to september when work is scarce on the ranches octavia passed the days in a kind of lotus eater s dream books hammocks correspondence with a few intimate friends a renewed interest in her old water colour box and easel these disposed of the sultry hours of daylight the evenings were always sure to bring enjoyment best of all were the rapturous horseback rides with teddy when the moon gave light over the wind swept leagues chaperoned by the wheeling night hawk and the startled owl often the mexicans would come up from their shacks with their guitars and sing the weirdest of heart breaking songs there were long cosy chats on the breezy gallery and an interminable warfare of wits between teddy and mrs macintyre whose abundant scotch shrewdness often more than overmatched the lighter humour in which she was lacking and the nights came one after another and were filed away by weeks and months nights soft and languorous and fragrant that should have driven strephon to chloe over wires however barbed that might have drawn cupid himself to hunt lasso in hand among those amorous pastures but teddy kept his fences up one july night madame bo peep and her ranch man ager were sitting on the east gallerv teddy had been exhausting the science of prognostication as to the proba bilities of a price of twenty four cents for the autumn clip and had then subsided into an anesthetic cloud of havana smoke only as incompetent a judge as a woman would have failed to note long ago that at least a third of his salary must have gone up in the fumes of those imported regalias teddy said octavia suddenly and rather sharply what are you working down here on a ranch for one hundred per said teddy glibly and found i ve a good mind to discharge you can t do it said teddy with a grin why not demanded octavia with argumentative heat under contract terms of sale respect all unexpired contracts mine runs until p m december thirty first you might get up at midnight on that date and fire me if you try it sooner i ll be in a position to bring legal proceedings octavia seemed to be considering the prospects of litigation but continued teddy cheerfully i ve been think ing of resigning anyway octavia s rocking chair ceased its motion there were centipedes in this country she felt sure and indians and vast lonely desolate empty wastes all within strong barbed wire fence there was a van dresser pride but there was also a van dresser heart she must know for certain whether or not he had forgotten ah well teddy she said with a fine assumption of polite interest it s lonely down here you re longing to get back to the old life to polo and lobsters and theatres and balls never cared much for balls said teddy virtuously you re getting old teddy your memory is failing nobody ever knew you to miss a dance unless it occurred on the same night with another one which you attended and you showed such shocking bad taste too in dancing too often with the same partner let me see what was that forbes girl s name the one with wall eyes mabel wasn t it no ad le mabel was the one with the bony elbows that wasn t wall in ad le s eyes it was soul we used to talk sonnets together and verlaine just then i was trying to run a pipe from the pierian spring you were on the floor with her said octavia unde flected five times at the hammersmiths hammersmiths what questioned teddy vacuously ball ball said octavia viciously what were we talking of eyes i thought said teddy after some reflection and elbows those hammersmiths went on octavia in her sweetest society prattle after subduing an intense desire to yank a handful of sunburnt sandy hair from the head lying back contentedly against the canvas of the steamer chair had too much money mines wasn t it it was something that paid something to the ton you couldn t get a glass of plain water in their house everything at that ball was dreadfully overdone it was said teddy such a crowd there was octavia continued con scious that she was talking the rapid drivel of a school girl describing her first dance the balconies were as warm as the rooms i lost something at that ball the last sentence was uttered in a tone calculated to remove the barbs from miles of wire so did i confessed teddy in a lower voice a glove said octavia falling back as the enemy approached her ditches caste said teddy halting his firing line without loss i hobnobbed half the evening with one of hammersmith s miners a fellow who kept his hands in his pockets and talked like an archangel about reduction plants and drifts and levels and sluice boxes a pearl gray glove nearly new sighed octavia mournfully a bang up chap that mcardle maintained teddy approvingly a man who hated olives and elevators a man who handled mountains as croquettes and built tunnels in the air a man who never uttered a word of silly nonsense in his life did you sign those lease renewal applications yet madama they ve got to be on file in the land office by the thirty first teddy turned his head lazily octavia s chair was vacant a certain centipede crawling along the lines marked out by fate expounded the situation it was early one morning while octavia and mrs maclntyre were trim ming the honeysuckle on the west gallery teddy had risen and departed hastily before daylight in response to word that a flock of ewes had been scattered from their bedding ground during the night by a thunder storm the centipede driven by destiny showed himself on the floor of the gallery and then the screeches of the two women giving him his cue he scuttled with all his yellow legs through the open door into the furthermost west room which was teddy s arming themselves with domestic utensils selected with regard to their length octavia and mrs maclntyre with much clutching of skirts and skirmishing for the position of rear guard in the attacking force followed once outside the centipede seemed to have disappeared and his prospective murderers began a thorough but cautious search for their victim even in the midst of such a dangerous and absorbing adventure octavia was conscious of an awed curiosity on finding herself in teddy s sanctum in that room he sat alone silently communing with those secret thoughts that he now shared with no one dreamed there whatever dreams he now called on no one to interpret it was the room of a spartan or a soldier in one corner stood a wide canvas covered cot in another a small bookcase in another a grim stand of winchesters and shotguns an immense table strewn with letters papers and documents and surmounted by a set of pigeon holes occupied one side the centipede showed genius in concealing himself in such bare quarters mrs maclntyre was poking a broom handle behind the bookcase octavia approached teddy s cot the room was just as the manager had left it in his hurry the mexican maid had not yet given it her attention there was his big pillow with the imprint of his head still in the centre she thought the horrid beast might have climbed the cot and hidden itself to bite teddy centipedes were thus cruel and vindictive toward managers she cautiously overturned the pillow and then parted her lips to give the signal for reinforcements at sight of a long slender dark object lying there but repressing it in time she caught up a glove a pearl gray glove flattened it might be conceived by many many months of nightly pressure beneath the pillow of the man who had forgotten the hammersmiths ball teddy must have left so hurriedly that morning that he had for once forgotten to transfer it to its resting place by day even managers who are notoriously wily and cunning are sometimes caught up with octavia slid the gray glove into the bosom of her sum mery morning gown it was hers men who put them selves within a strong barbed wire fence and remember hammersmith balls only by the talk of miners about sluice boxes should not be allowed to possess such articles after all what a paradise this prairie country was how it blossomed like the rose when you found things that were thought to be lost how delicious was that morning breeze coming in the windows fresh and sweet with the breath of the yellow ratama blooms might one not stand for a minute with shining far gazing eyes and dream that mistakes might be corrected why was mrs maclntyre poking about so absurdly with a broom i ve found it said mrs macintyre banging the door here it is did you lose something asked octavia with sweetly polite non interest the little devil said mrs maclntyre driven to violence ye ve no forgotten him alretty between them they slew the centipede thus was he rewarded for his agency toward the recovery of things lost at the hammersmiths ball it seems that teddy in due course remembered the glove and when he returned to the house at sunset made a secret but exhaustive search for it not until evening upon the moonlit eastern gallery did he find it it was upon the hand that he had thought lost to him forever and so he was moved to repeat certain nonsense that he had been commanded never never to utter again teddy s fences were down this time there was no ambition to stand in the way and the wooing was as natural and successful as should be between ardent shepherd and gentle shepherdess the prairies changed to a garden the rancho de las sombras became the ranch of light a few days later octavia received a letter from mr bannister in reply to one she had written to him asking some questions about her business a portion of the letter ran as follows i am at a loss to account for your references to the sheep ranch two months after your departure to take up your residence upon it it was discovered that colonel beaupree s title was worthless a deed came to light showing that he disposed of the property before his death the matter was reported to your manager mr westlake who at once repurchad the property it is entirely beyond my powers of conjecture to imagine how you have remained in ignorance of this fact i beg you that will at once confer with that gentleman who will at least corroborate my statement octavia sought teddy with battle in her eye what are you working on this ranch for she asked once more one hundred he began to repeat but saw in her face that she knew she held mr bannister s letter in her hand he knew that the game was up it s my ranch said teddy like a schoolboy detected in evil it s a mighty poor manager that isn t able to absorb the boss s business if you give him time why were you working down here pursued octavia still struggling after the key to the riddle of teddy to tell the truth tave said teddy with quiet candour it wasn t for the salary that about kept me in cigars and sunburn lotions i was sent south by my doctor twas that right lung that was going to the bad on account of over exercise and strain at polo and gym nastics i needed climate and ozone and rest and things of that sort in an instant octavia was close against the vicinity of the affected organ mr bannister s letter fluttered to the floor it s it s well now isn t it teddy sound as a mesquite chunk i deceived you in one thing i paid fifty thousand for your ranch as soon as i found you had no title i had just about that much income accumulated at my banker s while i ve been herding sheep down here so it was almost like picking the thing up on a bargain counter for a penny there s another little surplus of unearned increment piling up there tave i ve been thinking of a wedding trip in a yacht with white ribbons tied to the mast through the mediterranean and then up among the hebrides and down norway to the zuyder zee and i was thinking said octavia softly of a wedding gallop with my manager among the flocks of sheep and back to a wedding breakfast with mrs mae intyre on the gallery with maybe a sprig of orange blossom fastened to the red jar above the table teddy laughed and began to chant little bo peep has lost her sheep and doesn t know where to find em let em alone and they ll come home and octavia drew his head down and whispered in his ear but that is one of the tales they brought behind them

went for anything he usually but this is not baldy s story he poured out a third drink that was larger by a finger than the first and second baldy was in consultation and the consultee is worthy of his hire i d be king if i was you said baldy so positively that his holster creaked and his spurs rattled webb yeager pushed back his flat brimmed stetson and made further disorder in his straw coloured hair the tonsorial recourse being without avail he followed the liquid example of the more resourceful baldy if a man marries a queen it oughtn t to make him a two spot declared webb epitomising his grievances sure not said baldy sympathetic still thirsty and genuinely solicitous concerning the relative value of the cards by rights you re a king if i was you i d call for a new deal the cards have been stacked on you i ll tell you what you are webb yeager what asked webb with a hopeful look in his pale blue eyes you re a prince consort go easy said webb i never blackguarded you none it s a title explained baldy up among the picture cards but it don t take no tricks i ll tell you webb it s a brand they re got for certain animals in europe say that you or me or one of them dutch dukes marries in a royal family well by and by our wife gets to be queen are we king not in a million years at the coronation ceremonies we march between little casino and the ninth grand custodian of the royal hall bedchamber the only use we are is to appear in photographs and accept the responsibility for the heir apparent that ain t any square deal yes sir webb you re a prince consort and if i was you i d start a interregnum or a habeus corpus or somethin and i d be king if i had to turn from the bottom of the deck baldy emptied his glass to the ratification of his warwick pose baldy said webb solemnly me and you punched cows in the same outfit for years we been runnin on the same range and ridin the same trails since we was boys i wouldn t talk about my family affairs to nobody but you you was line rider on the nopalito ranch when i married santa mcallister i was foreman then but what am i now i don t amount to a knot in a stake rope when old mcallister was the cattle king of west texas continued baldy with satanic sweetness you was some tallow you had as much to say on the ranch as he did i did admitted webb up to the time he found out i was tryin to get my rope over santa s head then he kept me out on the range as far from the ranch house as he could when the old man died they commenced to call santa the cattle queen i m boss of the cattle that s all she tends to all the business she handles all the money i can t sell even a beef steer to a party of campers myself santa s the queen and i m mr nobody i d be king if i was you repeated baldy woods the royalist when a man marries a queen he ought to grade up with her on the hoof dressed dried corned any old way from the chaparral to the packing house lots of folks thinks it s funny webb that you don t have the say so on the nopalito i ain t reflectin none on miz yeager she s the finest little lady between the rio grande and next christmas but a man ought to be boss of his own camp the smooth brown face of yeager lengthened to a mask of wounded melancholy with that expression and his rumpled yellow hair and guileless blue eyes he might have been likened to a schoolboy whose leadership had been usurped by a youngster of superior strength but his active and sinewy seventy two inches and his girded revolvers forbade the comparison what was that you called me baldy he asked what kind of a concert was it a consort corrected baldy a prince consort it s a kind of short card pseudonym you come in sort of between jack high and a four card flush webb yeager sighed and gathered the strap of his winchester scabbard from the floor i m ridin back to the ranch to day he said half heartedly i ve got to start a bunch of beeves for san antone in the morning i m your company as far as dry lake announced baldy i ve got a round up camp on the san marcos cuttin out two year olds the two companeros mounted their ponies and trotted away from the little railroad settlement where they had foregathered in the thirsty morning at dry lake where their routes diverged they reined up for a parting cigarette for miles they had ridden in silence save for the soft drum of the ponies hoofs on the matted mesquite grass and the rattle of the chaparral against their wooden stirrups but in texas discourse is seldom continuous you may fill in a mile a meal and a murder between your paragraphs without detriment to your thesis so without apology webb offered an addendum to the conversation that had begun ten miles away you remember yourself baldy that there was a time when santa wasn t quite so independent you remember the days when old mcallister was keepin us apart and how she used to send me the sign that she wanted to see me old man mac promised to make me look like a colander if i ever come in gun shot of the ranch you remember the sign she used to send baldy the heart with a cross inside of it me cried baldy with intoxicated archness you old sugar stealing coyote don t i remember why you dad blamed old long horned turtle dove the boys in camp was all cognoscious about them hiroglyphs the gizzard and crossbones we used to call it we used to see em on truck that was sent out from the ranch they was marked in charcoal on the sacks of flour and in lead pencil on the newspapers i see one of em once chalked on the back of a new cook that old man mcallister sent out from the ranch danged if i didn t santa s father explained webb gently got her to promise that she wouldn t write to me or send me any word that heart and cross sign was her scheme whenever she wanted

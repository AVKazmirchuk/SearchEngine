its progress without intruding upon the province of the x ray or of park policemen a day came when thomas mcleod and celia lingered at the end of the latticed passage sixteen a week isn t much said thomas letting his cap rest on his shoulder blades celia looked through the lattice work and whistled a dead march shopping with aunt henrietta the day before she had paid that much for a dozen handkerchiefs maybe i ll get a raise next month said thomas i ll be around to morrow at the same time with a bag of flour and the laundry soap all right said celia annette s married cousin pays only a month for a flat in the bronx never for a moment did she count on the spraggins money she knew aunt henrietta s invincible pride of caste and pa s mightiness as a colossus of cash and she understood that if she chose thomas she and her grocer s young man might go whistle for a living another day came thomas violating the dignity of nabob avenue with the devil s dream whistled keenly between his teeth raised to eighteen a week yesterday he said been pricing flats around morningside you want to start untying those apron strings and unpinning that cap old girl oh tommy said celia with her broadest smile won t that be enough i got betty to show me how to make a cottage pudding i guess we could call it a flat pudding if we wanted to and tell no lie said thomas and i can sweep and polish and dust of course a parlor maid learns that and we cold whistle duets of evenings the old man said he d raise me to twenty at christmas if bryan couldn t think of any harder name to call a republican than a postponer said the grocer s young man i can sew said celia and i know that you must make the gas company s man show his badge when he comes to look at the meter and i know how to put up quince jam and window curtains bully you re all right cele yes i believe we can pull it off on eighteen as he was jumping into the wagon the second parlor maid braved discovery by running swiftly to the gate and oh tommy i forgot she called softly i believe i could make your neckties forget it said thomas decisively and another thing she continued sliced cucumbers at night will drive away cockroaches and sleep too you bet said mr mcleod yes i believe if i have a delivery to make on the west side this afternoon i ll look in at a furniture store i know over there it was just as the wagon dashed away that old jacob spraggins struck the sideboard with his fist and made the mysterious remark about ten thousand dollars that you perhaps remember which justifies the reflection that some stories as well as life and puppies thrown into wells move around in circles painfully but briefly we must shed light on jacob s words the foundation of his fortune was made when he was twenty a poor coal digger ever hear of a rich one had saved a dollar or two and bought a small tract of land on a hillside on which he tried to raise corn not a nubbin jacob whose nose was a divining rod told him there was a vein of coal beneath he bought the land from the miner for and sold it a month afterward for luckily the miner had enough left of his sale money to drink himself into a black coat opening in the back as soon as he heard the news and so for forty years afterward we find jacob illuminated with the sudden thought that if he could make restitution of this sum of money to the heirs or assigns of the unlucky miner respite and nepenthe might be his and now must come swift action for we have here some four thousand words and not a tear shed and never a pistol joke safe nor bottle cracked old jacob hired a dozen private detectives to find the heirs if any existed of the old miner hugh mcleod get the point of course i know as well as you do that thomas is going to be the heir i might have concealed the name but why always hold back you mystery till the end i say let it come near the middle so people can stop reading there if they want to after the detectives had trailed false clues about three thousand dollars i mean miles they cornered thomas at the grocery and got his confession that hugh mcleod had been his grandfather and that there were no other heirs they arranged a meeting for him and old jacob one morning in one of their offices jacob liked the young man very much he liked the way he looked straight at him when he talked and the way he threw his bicycle cap over the top of a rose colored vase on the centre table there was a slight flaw in jacob s system of restitution he did not consider that the act to be perfect should include confession so he represented himself to be the agent of the purchaser of the land who had sent him to refund the sale price for the ease of his conscience well sir said thomas this sounds to me like an illustrated post card from south boston with we re having a good time here written on it i don t know the game is this ten thousand dollars money or do i have to save so many coupons to get it old jacob counted out to him twenty five hundred dollar bills that was better he thought than a check thomas put them thoughtfully into his pocket grandfather s best thanks he said to the party who sends it jacob talked on asking him about his work how he spent his leisure time and what his ambitions were the more he saw and heard of thomas the better he liked him he had not met many young men in bagdad so frank and wholesome i would like to have you visit my house he said i might help you in investing or laying out your money i am a very wealthy man i have a daughter about grown and i would like for you to know her there are not many young men i would care to have call on her i m obliged said thomas i m not much at making calls it s generally the side entrance for mine and besides i m engaged to a girl that has the delaware peach crop killed in the blossom she s a parlor maid in a house where i deliver goods she won t be working there much longer though say don t forget to give your friend my grandfather s best regards you ll excuse me now my wagon s outside with a lot of green stuff that s got to be delivered see you again sir at eleven thomas delivered some bunches of parsley and lettuce at the spraggins mansion thomas was only twenty two so as he came back he took out the handful of five hundred dollar bills and waved them carelessly annette took a pair of eyes as big as creamed onion to the cook i told you he was a count she said after relating he never would carry on with me but you say he showed money said the cook hundreds of thousands said annette carried around loose in his pockets and he never would look at me it was paid to me to day thomas was explaining to celia outside it came from my grandfather s estate say cele what s the use of waiting now i m going to quit the job to night why can t we get married next week tommy said celia i m no parlor maid i ve been fooling you i m miss spraggins celia spraggins the newspapers say i ll be worth forty million dollars some day thomas pulled his cap down straight on his head for the first time since we have known him i suppose then said he i suppose then you ll not be marrying me next week but you can whistle no said celia i ll not be marrying you next week my father would never let me marry a grocer s clerk but i ll marry you to night tommy if you say so old jacob spraggins came home at p m in his motor car the make of it you will have to surmise sorrowfully i am giving you unsubsidized fiction had it been a street car i could have told you its voltage and the number of wheels it had jacob called for his daughter he had bought a ruby necklace for her and wanted to hear her say what a kind thoughtful dear old dad he was there was a brief search in the house for her and then came annette glowing with the pure flame of truth and loyalty well mixed with envy and histrionics oh sir said she wondering if she should kneel miss celia s just this minute running away out of the side gate with a young man to be married i couldn t stop her sir they went in a cab what young man roared old jacob a millionaire if you please sir a rich nobleman in disguise he carries his money with him and the red peppers and the onions was only to blind us sir he never did seem to take to me jacob rushed out in time to catch his car the chauffeur had been delayed by trying to light a cigarette in the wind here gaston or mike or whatever you call yourself scoot around the corner quicker than blazes and see if you can see a cab if you do run it down there was a cab in sight a block away gaston or mike with his eyes half shut and his mind on his cigarette picked up the trail neatly crowded the cab to the curb and pocketed it what t ell you doin yelled the cabman pa shrieked celia grandfather s remorseful friend s agent said thomas wonder what s on his conscience now a thousand thunders said gaston or mike i have no other match young man said old jacob severely how about that parlor maid you were engaged to a couple of years afterward old jacob went into the office of his private secretary the amalgamated missionary society solicits a contribution of toward the conversion of the koreans said the secretary pass em up said jacob the university of plumville writes that its yearly endowment fund of that you bestowed upon it is past due tell em it s been cut out the scientific society of clam cove long island asks for to buy alcohol to preserve specimens waste basket the society for providing healthful recreation for working girls wants from you to lay out a golf course tell em to see an undertaker cut em all out went on jacob i ve quit being a good thing i need every dollar i can scrape or save i want you to write to the directors of every company that i m interested in and recommend a per cent cut in salaries and say i noticed half a cake of soap lying in a corner of the hall as i came in i want you to speak to the scrubwoman about waste i ve got no money to throw away and say we ve got vinegar pretty well in hand haven t we the globe spice seasons company said secretary controls the market at present raise vinegar two cents a gallon notify all our branches suddenly jacob spraggin s plump red face relaxed into a pulpy grin he walked over to the secretary s desk and showed a small red mark on his thick forefinger bit it he said darned if he didn t and he ain t had the tooth three weeks jaky mcleod my celia s kid he ll be worth a hundred millions by the time he s twenty one if i can pile it up for him as he was leaving old jacob turned at the door and said better make that vinegar raise three cents instead of two i ll be back in an hour and sign the letters the true history of the caliph harun al rashid relates that toward the end of his reign he wearied of philanthropy and caused to be beheaded all his former favorites and companions of his arabian nights rambles happy are we in these days of enlightenment when the only death warrant the caliphs can serve on us is in the form of a tradesman s bill the girl and the habit habit a tendency or aptitude acquired by custom or frequent repitition the critics have assailed every source of inspiration save one to that one we are driven for our moral theme when we levied upon the masters of old they gleefully dug up the parallels to our columns when we strove to set forth real life they reproached us for trying to imitate henry george george washington washington irving and irving bacheller we wrote of the west and the east and they accused us of both jesse and henry james we wrote from our heart and they said something about a disordered liver we took a text from matthew or er yes deuteronomy but the preachers were hammering away at the inspiration idea before we could get into type so driven to the wall we go for our subject matter to the reliable old moral unassailable vade mecum the unabridged dictionary miss merriam was cashier at hinkle s hinkle s is one of the big downtown restaurants it is in what the papers call the financial district each day from o clock to hinkle s was full of hungry customers messenger boys stenographers brokers owners of mining stock promoters inventors with patents pending and also people with money the cashiership at hinkle s was no sinecure hinkle egged and toasted and griddle caked and coffeed a good many customers and he lunched as good a word as dined many more it might be said that hinkle s breakfast crowd was a contingent but his luncheon patronage amounted to a horde miss merriam sat on a stool at a desk inclosed on three sides by a strong high fencing of woven brass wire through an arched opening at the bottom you thrust your waiter s check and the money while your heart went pit pat for miss merriam was lovely and capable she could take cents out of a bill and refuse an offer of marriage before you could next lost your chance please don t shove she could keep cool and collected while she collected your check give you the correct change win your heart indicate the toothpick stand and rate you to a quarter of a cent better than bradstreet could to a thousand in less time than it takes to pepper an egg with one of hinkle s casters there is an old and dignified allusion to the fierce light that beats upon a throne the light that beats upon the young lady cashier s cage is also something fierce the other fellow is responsible for the slang every male patron of hinkle s from a d t boys up to the curbstone brokers adored miss merriam when they paid their checks they wooed her with every wile known to cupid s art between the meshes of the brass railing went smiles winks compliments tender vows invitations to dinner sighs languishing looks and merry banter that was wafted pointedly back by the gifted miss merriam there is no coign of vantage more effective than the position of young lady cashier she sits there easily queen of the court of commerce she is duchess of dollars and devoirs countess of compliment and coin leading lady of love and luncheon you take from her a smile and a canadian dime and you go your way uncomplaining you count the cheery word or two that she tosses you as misers count their treasures and you pocket the change for a five uncomputed perhaps the brass bound inaccessibility multiplies her charms anyhow she is a shirt waisted angel immaculate trim manicured seductive bright eyed ready alert psyche circe and ate in one separating you from your circulating medium after your sirloin medium the young men who broke bread at hinkle s never settled with the cashier without an exchange of badinage and open compliment many of them went to greater lengths and dropped promissory hints of theatre tickets and chocolate the older spoke plainly of orange blossoms generally withering the tentative petals by after allusions to harlem flats one broker who had been squeezed by copper proposed to miss merriam more regularly than he ate during a brisk luncheon hour miss merriam s conversation while she took money for checks would run something like this good morning mr haskins sir it s natural thank you don t be quite so fresh hello johnny ten

middle of one afternoon the dizzy goddess vertigo whose other name is fortune suddenly smote an old wealthy and eccentric banker while he was walking past hinkle s on his way to a street car a wealthy and eccentric banker who rides in street cars is move up please there are others a samaritan a pharisee a man and a policeman who were first on the spot lifter banker mcramsey and carried him into hinkle s restaurant when the aged but indestructible banker opened his eyes he saw a beautikful vision bending over him with a pitiful tender smile bathing his forehead with beef tea and chafing his hands with something frapp e out of a chafing dish mr mcramsey sighed lost a vest button gazed with deep gratitude upon his fair preserveress and then recovered consciousness to the seaside library all who are anticipating a romance banker mcramsey had an aged and respected wife and his sentiments toward miss merriam were fatherly he talked to her for half an hour with interest not the kind that went with his talks during business hours the next day he brought mrs mcramsey down to see her the old couple were childless they had only a married daughter living in brooklyn to make a short story shorter the beautiful cashier won the hearts of the good old couple they came to hinkle s again and again they invited her to their old fashioned but splendid home in one of the east seventies miss merriam s winning loveliness her sweet frankness and impulsive heart took them by storm they said a hundred times that miss merriam reminded them so much of their lost daughter the brooklyn matron n ee ramsey had the figure of buddha and a face like the ideal of an art photographer miss merriam was a combination of curves smiles rose leaves pearls satin and hair tonic posters enough of the fatuity of parents a month after the worthy couple became acquainted with miss merriam she stood before hinkle one afternoon and resigned her cashiership they re going to adopt me she told the bereft restaurateur they re funny old people but regular dears and the swell home they have got say hinkle there isn t any use of talking i m on the a la carte to wear brown duds and goggles in a whiz wagon or marry a duke at least still i somehow hate to break out of the old cage i ve been cashiering so long i feel funny doing anything else i ll miss joshing the fellows awfully when they line up to pay

you hinkle and they did miss merriam became miss rosa mcramsey and she graced the transition beauty is only skin deep but the nerves lie very near to the skin nerve but just here will you oblige by perusing again the quotation with which this story begins the mcramseys poured out money like domestic champagne to polish their adopted one milliners dancing masters and private tutors got it miss er mcramsey was grateful loving and tried to forget hinkle s to give ample credit to the adaptability of the american girl hinkle s did fade from her memory and speech most of the time not every one will remember when the earl of hitesbury came to east seventy street america he was only a fair to medium earl without debts and he created little excitement but you will surely remember the evening when the daughters of benevolence haled their bazaar in the w f a a hotel for you were there and you wrote a note to fannie on the hotel paper and mailed it just to show her that you did not very well that was the evening the baby was sick of course at the bazaar the mcramseys were prominent miss mer er mcramsey was exquisitely beautiful the earl of hitesbury had been very attentive to her since he dropped in to have a look at america at the charity bazaar the affair was supposed to be going to be pulled off to a finish an earl is as good as a duke better his standing may be lower but his outstanding accounts are also lower our ex young lady cashier was assigned to a booth she was expected to sell worthless articles to nobs and snobs at exorbitant prices the proceeds of the bazaar were to be used for giving the poor children of the slums a christmas din say did you ever wonder where they get the other miss mcramsey beautiful palpitating excited charming radiant fluttered about in her booth an imitation brass network with a little arched opening fenced her in along came the earl assured delicate accurate admiring admiring greatly and faced the open wicket you look chawming you know pon my word you do my deah he said beguilingly cut that joshing out she said coolly and briskly who do you think you are talking to your check please oh lordy patrons of the bazaar became aware of a commotion and pressed around a certain booth the earl of hitesbury stood near by pulling a pale blond and puzzled whisker miss mcramsey has fainted some one explained proof of the pudding spring winked a vitreous optic at editor westbrook of the minerva magazine and deflected him from his course he had lunched in his favorite corner of a broadway hotel and was returning to his office when his feet became entangled in the lure of the vernal coquette which is by way of saying that he turned eastward in twenty sixth street safely forded the spring freshet of vehicles in fifth avenue and meandered along the walks of budding madison square the lenient air and the settings of the little park almost formed a pastoral the color motif was green the presiding shade at the creation of man and vegetation the callow grass between the walks was the color of verdigris a poisonous green reminiscent of the horde of derelict humans that had breathed upon the soil during the summer and autumn the bursting tree buds looked strangely familiar to those who had botanized among the garnishings of the fish course of a forty cent dinner the sky above was of that pale aquamarine tint that ballroom poets rhyme with true and sue and coo the one natural and frank color visible was the ostensible green of the newly painted benches a shade between the color of a pickled cucumber and that of a last year s fast black cravenette raincoat but to the city bred eye of editor westbrook the landscape appeared a masterpiece and now whether you are of those who rush in or of the gentle concourse that fears to tread you must follow in a brief invasion of the editor s mind editor westbrook s spirit was contented and serene the april number of the minerva had sold its entire edition before the tenth day of the month a newsdealer in keokuk had written that he could have sold fifty copies more if he had em the owners of the magazine had raised his the editor s salary he had just installed in his home a jewel of a recently imported cook who was afraid of policemen and the morning papers had published in full a speech he had made at a publishers banquet also there were echoing in his mind the jubilant notes of a splendid song that his charming young wife had sung to him before he left his up town apartment that morning she was taking enthusiastic interest in her music of late practising early and diligently when he had complimented her on the improvement in her voice she had fairly hugged him for joy at his praise he felt too the benign tonic medicament of the trained nurse spring tripping softly adown the wards of the convalescent city while editor westbrook was sauntering between the rows of park benches already filling with vagrants and the guardians of lawless childhood he felt his sleeve grasped and held suspecting that he was about to be panhandled he turned a cold and unprofitable face and saw that his captor was dawe shackleford dawe dingy almost ragged the genteel scracely visible in him through the deeper lines of the shabby while the editor is pulling himself out of his surprise a flashlight biography of dawe is offered he was a fiction writer and one of westbrook s old acquaintances at one time they might have called each other old friends dawe had some money in those days and lived in a decent apartment house near westbrook s the two families often went to theatres and dinners together mrs dawe and mrs westbrook became dearest friends then one day a little tentacle of the octopus just to amuse itself ingurgitated dawe s capital and he moved to the gramercy park neighborhood where one for a few groats per week may sit upon one s trunk under eight branched chandeliers and opposite carrara marble mantels and watch the mice play upon the floor dawe thought to live by writing fiction now and then he sold a story he submitted many to westbrook the minerva printed one or two of them the rest were returned westbrook sent a careful and conscientious personal letter with each rejected manuscript pointing out in detail his reasons for considering it unavailable editor westbrook had his own clear conception of what constituted good fiction so had dawe mrs dawe was mainly concerned about the constituents of the scanty dishes of food that she managed to scrape together one day dawe had been spouting to her about the excellencies of certain french writers at dinner they sat down to a dish that a hungry schoolboy could have encompassed at a gulp dawe commented it s maupassant hash said mrs dawe it may not be art but i do wish you would do a five course marion crawford serial with an ella wheeler wilcox sonnet for dessert i m hungry as far as this from success was shackleford dawe when he plucked editor westbrook s sleeve in madison square that was the first time the editor had seen dawe in several months why shack is this you said westbrook somewhat awkwardly for the form of his phrase seemed to touch upon the other s changed appearance sit down for a minute said dawe tugging at his sleeve this is my office i can t come to yours looking as i do oh sit down you won t be disgraced those half plucked birds on the other benches will take you for a swell porch climber they won t know you are only an editor smoke shack said editor westbrook sinking cautiously upon the virulent green bench he always yielded gracefully when he did yield dawe snapped at the cigar as a kingfisher darts at a sunperch or a girl pecks at a chocolate cream i have just began the editor oh i know don t finish said dawe give me a match you have just ten minutes to spare how did you manage to get past my office boy and invade my sanctum there he goes now throwing his club at a dog that couldn t read the keep off the grass signs how goes the writing asked the editor look at me said dawe for your answer now don t put on that embarrassed friendly but honest look and ask me why i don t get a job as a wine agent or a cab driver i m in the fight to a finish i know i can write good fiction and i ll force you fellows to admit it yet i ll make you change the spelling of regrets to c h e q u e before i m done with you editor westbrook gazed through his nose glasses with a sweetly sorrowful omniscient sympathetic skeptical expression the copyrighted expression of the editor beleagured by the unavailable contributor have you read the last story i sent you the alarum of the soul asked dawe carefully i hesitated over that story shack really i did it had some good points i was writing you a letter to send with it when it goes back to you i regret never mind the regrets said dawe grimly there s neither salve nor sting in em any more what i want to know is why come now out with the good points first the story said westbrook deliberately after a suppressed sigh is written around an almost original plot characterization the best you have done construction almost as good except for a few weak joints which might be strengthened by a few changes and touches it was a good story except i can write english can t i interrupted dawe i have always told you said the editor that you had a style then the trouble is same old thing said editor westbrook you work up to your climax like an artist and then you turn yourself into a photographer i don t know what form of obstinate madness possesses you but that is what you do with everything that you write no i will retract the comparison with the photographer now and then photography in spite of its impossible perspective manages to record a fleeting glimpse of truth but you spoil every d enouement by those flat drab obliterating strokes of your brush that i have so often complained of if you would rise to the literary pinnacle of your dramatic senses and paint them in the high colors that art requires the postman would leave fewer bulky self addressed envelopes at your door oh fiddles and footlights cried dawe derisively you ve got that old sawmill drama kink in your brain yet when the man with the black mustache kidnaps golden haired bessie you are bound to have the mother kneel and raise her hands in the spotlight and say may high heaven witness that i will rest neither night nor day till the heartless villain that has stolen me child feels the weight of another s vengeance editor westbrook conceded a smile of impervious complacency i think said he that in real life the woman would express herself in those words or in very similar ones not in a six hundred nights run anywhere but on the stage said dawe hotly i ll tell you what she d say in real life she d say what bessie led away by a strange man good lord it s one trouble after another get my other hat i must hurry around to the police station why wasn t somebody looking after her i d like to know for god s sake get out of my way or i ll never get ready not that hat the brown one with the velvet bows bessie must have been crazy she s usually shy of strangers is that too much powder lordy how i m upset that s the way she d talk continued dawe people in real life don t fly into heroics and blank verse at emotional crises they simply can t do it if they talk at all on such occasions they draw from the same vocabulary that they use every day and muddle up their words and ideas a little more that s all shack said editor westbrook impressively did you ever pick up the mangled and lifeless form of a child from under the fender of a street car and carry it in your arms and lay it down before the distracted mother did you ever do that and listen to the words of grief and despair as they flowed spontaneously from her lips i never did said dawe did you well no said editor westbrook with a slight frown but i can well imagine what she would say so can i said dawe and now the fitting time had come for editor westbrook to play the oracle and silence his opinionated contributor it was not for an unarrived fictionist to dictate words to be uttered by the heroes and heroines of the minerva magazine contrary to the theories of the editor thereof my dear shack said he if i know anything of life i know that every sudden deep and tragic emotion in the human heart calls forth an apposite concordant conformable and proportionate expression of feeling how much of this inevitable accord between expression and feeling should be attributed to nature and how much to the influence of art it would be difficult to say the sublimely terrible roar of the lioness that has been deprived of her cubs is dramatically as far above her customary whine and purr as the kingly and transcendent utterances of lear are above the level of his senile vaporings but it is also true that all men and women have what may be called a sub conscious dramatic sense that is awakened by a sufficiently deep and powerful emotion a sense unconsciously acquired from literature and the stage that prompts them to express those emotions in language befitting their importance and histrionic value and in the name of the seven sacred saddle blankets of sagittarius where did the stage and literature get the stunt asked dawe from life answered the editor triumphantly the story writer rose from the bench and gesticulated eloquently but dumbly he was beggared for words with which to formulate adequately his dissent on a bench nearby a frowzy loafer opened his red eyes and perceived that his moral support was due a downtrodden brother punch him one jack he called hoarsely to dawe w at s he come makin a noise like a penny arcade for amongst gen lemen that comes in the square to set and think editor westbrook looked at his watch with an affected show of leisure tell me asked dawe with truculent anxiety what especial faults in the alarum of the soul caused you to throw it down when gabriel murray said westbrook goes to his telephone and is told that his fianc ee has been shot by a burglar he says i do not recall the exact words but i do said dawe he says damn central she always cuts me off and then to his friend say tommy does a thirty two bullet make a big hole it s kind of hard luck ain t it could you get me a drink from the sideboard tommy no straight nothing on the side and again continued the editor without pausing for argument when berenice opens the letter from her husband informing her that he has fled with the manicure girl her words are let me see she says interposed the author well what do you think of that absurdly inappropriate words said westbrook presenting an anti climax plunging the story into hopeless bathos worse yet they mirror life falsely no human being ever uttered banal colloquialisms when confronted by sudden tragedy wrong said dawe closing his unshaven jaws doggedly i say no man or woman ever spouts high falutin talk when they go up against a real climax they talk naturally and a little worse the editor rose from the bench with his air of indulgence and inside information say westbrook said dawe pinning him by the lapel would you have accepted the alarum of the soul if you had believed that the actions and words of the characters were true to life in the parts of the story that we discussed it is very likely that i would if i believed that way said the editor but i have explained to you that i do not if i could prove to you that i am right i m sorry shack but i m afraid i haven t time to argue any further just now i don t want to argue said dave i want to demonstrate to you from life itself that my view is the correct one how could you do that asked westbrook in a surprised tone listen said the writer seriously i have thought of a way it is important to me that my theory of true to life fiction be recognized as correct by the magazines i ve fought for it for three years and i m down to my last dollar with two months rent due i have applied the opposite of your theory said the editor in selecting the fiction for the minerva magazine the circulation has gone up from ninety thousand to four hundred thousand said dawe whereas it should have been boosted to a million you said something to me just now about demonstrating your pet theory i will if you ll give me about half an hour of your time i ll prove to you that i am right i ll prove it by louise your wife exclaimed westbrook how well not exactly by her but with her said dawe now you know how devoted and loving louse has always been she thinks i m the only genuine preparation on the market that bears the old doctor s signature she s been fonder and more faithful than ever since i ve been cast for the neglected genius part indeed she is a charming and admirable life companion agreed the editor i remember what inseparable friends she and mrs westbrook once were we are both lucky chaps shack to have such wives you must bring mrs dawe up some evening soon and we ll have one of those informal chafing dish suppers that we used to enjoy so much later said dawe when i get another shirt and now i ll tell you my scheme when i was about to leave home after breakfast if you can call tea and oatmeal breakfast louise told me she was going to visit her aunt in eighty ninth street she said she would return at three o clock she is always on time to a minute it is now dawe glanced toward the editor s watch pocket twenty seven minutes to three said westbrook scanning his time piece we have just enough time said dawe we will go to my flat at once i will write a note address it to her and leave it on the table where she will see it as she enters the door you and i will be in the dining room concealed by the porti eres in that note i ll say that i have fled from her forever with an affinity who understands the need of my artistic soul as she never did when she reads it we will observe her actions and hear her words then we will know which theory is the correct one yours or mine oh never exclaimed the editor shaking his head that would be inexcusably cruel i could not consent to have mrs dawe s feelings played upon in such a manner brace up said the writer i guess i think as much of her as you do it s for her benefit as well as mine i ve got to get a market for my stories in some way it won t hurt louise she s healthy and sound her heart goes as strong as a ninety eight cent watch it ll last for only a minute and then i ll step out and explain to her you really owe it to me to give me the chance westbrook editor westbrook at length yielded though but half willingly and in the half of him that consented lurked the vivisectionist that is in all of us let him who has not used the scalpel rise and stand in his place pity tis that there are not enough rabbits and guinea pigs to go around the two experimenters in art left the square and hurried eastward and then to that south until they arrived in the gramercy neighborhood within its high iron railings the little park had put on its smart coat of vernal green and was admiring itself in its fountain mirror outside the railings the hollow square of crumbling houses shells of a bygone gentry leaned as if in ghostly gossip over the forgotten doings of the vanished quality sic transit gloria urbis a block or two north of the park dawe steered the editor again eastward then after covering a short distance into a lofty but narrow flathouse burdened with a floridly over decorated fa cade to the fifth story they toiled and dawe panting pushed his latch key into the door of one of the front flats when the door opened editor westbrook saw with feelings of pity how meanly and meagerly the rooms were furnished get a chair if you can find one said dawe while i hunt up pen and ink hello what s this here s a note from louise she must have left it there when she went out this morning he picked up an envelope that lay on the centre table and tore it open he began to read the letter that he drew out of it and once having begun it aloud he so read it through to the end these are the words that editor westbrook heard dear shackleford by the time you get this i will be about a hundred miles away and still a going i ve got a place in the chorus of the occidental opera co and we start on the road to day at twelve o clock i didn t want to starve to death and so i decided to make my own living i m not coming back mrs westbrook is going with me she said she was tired of living with a combination phonograph iceberg and dictionary and she s not coming back either we ve been practising the songs and dances for two months on the quiet i hope you will be successful and get along all right good bye louise dawe dropped the letter covered his face with his trembling hands and cried out in a deep vibrating voice my god why hast thou given me this cup to drink since she is false then let thy heaven s fairest gifts faith and love become the jesting by words of traitors and fiends editor westbrook s glasses fell to the floor the fingers of one hand fumbled with a button on his coat as he blurted between his pale lips say shack ain t that a hell of a note wouldn t that knock you off your perch shack ain t it hell now shack ain t it past one at rooney s only on the lower east side of new york do the houses of capulet and montagu survive there they do not fight by the book of arithmetic if you but bite your thumb at an upholder of your opposing house you have work cut out for your steel on broadway you may drag your man along a dozen blocks by his nose and he will only bawl for the watch but in the domain of the east side tybalts and mercutios you must observe the niceties of deportment to the wink of any eyelash and to an inch of elbow room at the bar when its patrons include foes of your house and kin so when eddie mcmanus known to the capulets as cork mcmanus drifted into dutch mike s for a stein of beer and came upon a bunch of montagus making merry with the suds he began to observe the strictest parliamentary rules courtesy forbade his leaving the saloon with his thirst unslaked caution steered him to a place at the bar where the mirror supplied the cognizance of the enemy s movements that his indifferent gaze seemed to disdain experience whispered to him that the finger of trouble would be busy among the chattering steins at dutch mike s that night close by his side drew brick cleary his mercutio companion of his perambulations thus they stood four of the mulberry hill gang and two fo the dry dock gang minding their p s and q s so solicitously that dutch mike kept one eye on his customers and the other on an open space beneath his bar in which it was his custom to seek safety whenever the ominous politeness of the rival associations congealed into the shapes of bullets and cold steel but we have not to do with the wars of the mulberry hills and the dry docks we must to rooney s where on the most blighted dead branch of the tree of life a little pale orchid shall bloom overstrained etiquette at last gave way it is not known who first overstepped the bounds of punctilio but the consequences were immediate buck malone of the mulberry hills with a dewey like swiftness got an eight inch gun swung round from his hurricane deck but mcmanus s simile must be the torpedo he glided in under the guns and slipped a scant three inches of knife blade between the ribs of the mulberry hill cruiser meanwhile brick cleary a devotee to strategy had skimmed across the lunch counter and thrown the switch of the electrics leaving the combat to be waged by the light of gunfire alone dutch mike crawled from his haven and ran into the street crying for the watch instead of for a shakespeare to immortalize the cimmerian shindy the cop came and found a prostrate bleeding montagu supported by three distrait and reticent followers of the house faithful to the ethics of the gangs no one knew whence the hurt came there was no capulet to be seen raus mit der interrogatories said buck malone to the officer sure i know who done it i always manages to get a bird s eye view of any guy that comes up an makes a show case for a hardware store out of me no i m not telling you his name i ll settle with um meself wow ouch easy boys yes i ll attend to his case meself i m not making any complaint at midnight mcmanus strolled around a pile of lumber near an east side dock and lingered in the vicinity of a certain water plug brick cleary drifted casually to the trysting place ten minutes later he ll maybe not croak said brick and he won t tell of course but dutch mike did he told the police he was tired of having his place shot up it s unhandy just now because tim corrigan s in europe for a week s end with kings he ll be back on the kaiser williams next friday you ll have to duck out of sight till then tim ll fix it up all right for us when he comes back this goes to explain why cork mcmanus went into rooney s one night and there looked upon the bright stranger face of romance for the first time in his precarious career until tim corrigan should return from his jaunt among kings and princes and hold up his big white finger in private offices it was unsafe for cork in any of the old haunts of his gang so he lay perdu in the high rear room of a capulet reading pink sporting sheets and cursing the slow paddle wheels of the kaiser wilhelm it was on thursday evening that cork s seclusion became intolerable to him never a hart panted for water fountain as he did for the cool touch of a drifting stein for the firm security of a foot rail in the hollow of his shoe and the quiet hearty challenges of friendship and repartee along and across the shining bars but he must avoid the district where he was known the cops were looking for him everywhere for news was scarce and the newspapers were harping again on the failure of the police to suppress the gangs if they got him before corrigan came back the big white finger could not be uplifted it would be too late then but corrigan would be home the next day so he felt sure there would be small danger in a little excursion that night among the crass pleasures that represented life to him at half past twelve mcmanus stood in a darkish cross town street looking up at the name rooney s picked out by incandescent lights against a signboard over a second story window he had heard of the place as a tough hang out with its frequenters and its locality he was unfamiliar guided by certain unerring indications common to all such resorts he ascended the stairs and entered the large room over the caf e here were some twenty or thirty tables at this time about half filled with rooney s guests waiters served drinks at one end a human pianola with drugged eyes hammered the keys with automatic and furious unprecision at merciful intervals a waiter would roar or squeak a song songs full of mr jonsons and babes and coons historical word guaranties of the genuineness of african melodies composed by red waistcoated young gentlemen natives of the cotton fields and rice swamps of west twenty eighth street for one brief moment you must admire rooney with me as he receives seats manipulates and chaffs his guests he is twenty nine he has wellington s nose dante s chin the cheek bones of an iroquois the smile of talleyrand corbett s foot work and the pose of an eleven year old east side central park queen of the may he is assisted by a lieutenant known as frank a pudgy easy chap swell dressed who goes among the tables seeing that dull care does not intrude now what is there about rooney s to inspire all this pother it is more respectable by daylight stout ladies with children and mittens and bundles and unpedigreed dogs drop up of afternoons for a stein and a chat even by gaslight the diversions are melancholy i the mouth drink and rag time and an occasional surprise when the waiter swabs the suds from under your sticky glass there is an answer transmigration the soul of sir walter raleigh has traveled from beneath his slashed doublet to a kindred home under rooney s visible plaid waistcoat rooney s is twenty years ahead of the times rooney has removed the embargo rooney has spread his cloak upon the soggy crossing of public opinion and any elizabeth who treads upon it is as much a queen as another attend to the revelation of the secret in rooney s ladies may smoke mcmanus sat down at a vacant table he paid for the glass of beer that he ordered tilted his narrow brimmed derby to the back of his brick dust head twined his feet among the rungs of his chair and heaved a sigh of contentment from the breathing spaces of his innermost soul for this mud honey was clarified sweetness to his taste the sham gaiety the hectic glow of counterfeit hospitality the self conscious joyless laughter the wine born warmth the loud music retrieving the hour from frequent whiles of awful and corroding silence the presence of well clothed and frank eyed beneficiaries of rooney s removal of the restrictions laid upon the weed the familiar blended odors of soaked lemon peel flat beer and peau d espagne all these were manna to cork mcmanus hungry for his week in the desert of the capulet s high rear room a girl alone entered rooney s glanced around with leisurely swiftness and sat opposite mcmanus at his table her eyes rested upon him for two seconds in the look with which woman reconnoitres all men whom she for the first time confronts in that space of time she will decide upon one of two things either to scream for the police or that she may marry him later on her brief inspection concluded the girl laid on the table a worn red morocco shopping bag with the inevitable top gallant sail of frayed lace handkerchief flying from a corner of it after she had ordered a small beer from the immediate waiter she took from her bag a box of cigarettes and lighted one with slightly exaggerated ease of manner then she looked again in the eyes of cork mcmanus and smiled instantly the doom of each was sealed the unqualified desire of a man to buy clothes and build fires for a woman for a whole lifetime at first sight of her is not uncommon among that humble portion of humanity that does not care for bradstreet or coats of arms or shaw s plays love at first sight has occurred a time or two in high life but as a rule the extempore mania is to be found among unsophisticated cratures such as the dove the blue tailed dingbat and the ten dollar a week clerk poets subscribers to all fiction magazines and schatchens take notice with the exchange of the mysterious magnetic current came to each of them the instant desire to lie pretend dazzle and deceive which is the worst thing about the hypocritical disorder known as love have another beer suggested cork in his circle the phrase was considered to be a card accompanied by a letter of introduction and references no thanks said the girl raising her eyebrows and choosing her conventional words carefully i merely dropped in for a slight refreshment the cigarette between her fingers seemed to require explanation my aunt is a russian lady she concluded and we often have a post perannual cigarette after dinner at home cheese it said cork whom society airs oppressed your fingers are as yellow as mine say said the girl blazing upon him with low voiced indignation what do you think i am say who do you think you are talking to what she was pretty to look at her eyes were big brown intrepid and bright uner her flat sailor hat planted jauntily on one side her crinkly tawny hair parted and was drawn back low and massy in a thick pendant knot behind the roundness of girlhood still lingered in her chin and neck but her cheeks and fingers were thinning slightly she looked upon the world with defiance suspicion and sullen wonder her smart short tan coat was soiled and expensive two inches below her black dress dropped the lowest flounce of a heliotrope silk underskirt beg your pardon said cork looking at her admiringly i didn t mean anything sure it s no harm to smoke maudy rooney s said the girl softened at once by his amends is the only place i know where a lady can smoke maybe it ain t a nice habit but aunty lets us at home and my name ain t maudy if you please it s ruby delamere that s a swell handle said cork approvingly mine s mcmanus cor er eddie mcmanus oh you can t help that laughed ruby don t apologize cork looked seriously at the big clock on rooney s wall the girl s ubiquitous eyes took in the movement i know it s late she said reaching for her bag but you know how you want a smoke when you want one ain t rooney s all right i never saw anything wrong here this is twice i ve been in i work in a bookbindery on third avenue a lot of us girls have been working overtime three nights a week they won

lugged around by a much larger lady she was a very little girl with eyes and hair that had kept on growing after she had stopped and that always looked as if they were saying goodness me why didn t you keep up with us mrs parker showed her the double parlours in this closet she said one could keep a skeleton or anaesthetic or coal but i am neither a doctor nor a dentist said miss leeson with a shiver mrs parker gave her the incredulous pitying sneering icy stare that she kept for those who failed to qualify as doctors or dentists and led the way to the second floor back eight dollars said miss leeson dear me i m not hetty if i do look green i m just a poor little working girl show me something higher and lower mr skidder jumped and strewed the floor with cigarette stubs at the rap on his door excuse me mr skidder said mrs parker with her demon s smile at his pale looks i didn t know you were in i asked the lady to have a look at your lambrequins they re too lovely for anything said miss leeson smiling in exactly the way the angels do after they had gone mr skidder got very busy erasing the tall black haired heroine from his latest unproduced play and inserting a small roguish one with heavy bright hair and vivacious features anna held ll jump at it said mr skidder to himself putting his feet up against the lambrequins and disappearing in a cloud of smoke like an aerial cuttlefish presently the tocsin call of clara sounded to the world the state of miss leeson s purse a dark goblin seized her mounted a stygian stairway thrust her into a vault with a glimmer of light in its top and muttered the menacing and cabalistic words two dollars i ll take it sighed miss leeson sinking down upon the squeaky iron bed every day miss leeson went out to work at night she brought home papers with handwriting on them and made copies with her typewriter sometimes she had no work at night and then she would sit on the steps of the high stoop with the other roomers miss leeson was not intended for a sky light room when the plans were drawn for her creation she was gay hearted and full of tender whimsical fancies once she let mr skidder read to her three acts of his great unpublished comedy it s no kid or the heir of the subway there was rejoicing among the gentlemen roomers whenever miss leeson had time to sit on the steps for an hour or two but miss longnecker the tall blonde who taught in a public school and said well really to everything you said sat on the top step and sniffed and miss dorn who shot at the moving ducks at coney every sunday and worked in a department store sat on the bottom step and sniffed miss leeson sat on the middle step and the men would quickly group around her especially mr skidder who had cast her in his mind for the star part in a private romantic unspoken drama in real life and especially mr hoover who was forty five fat flush and foolish and especially very young mr evans who set up a hollow cough to induce her to ask him to leave off cigarettes the men voted her the funniest and jolliest ever but the sniffs on the top step and the lower step were implacable i pray you let the drama halt while chorus stalks to the footlights and drops an epicedian tear upon the fatness of mr hoover tune the pipes to the tragedy of tallow the bane of bulk the calamity of corpulence tried out falstaff might have rendered more romance to the ton than would have romeo s rickety ribs to the ounce a lover may sigh but he must not puff to the train of momus are the fat men remanded in vain beats the faithfullest heart above a inch belt avaunt hoover hoover forty five flush and foolish might carry off helen herself hoover forty five flush foolish and fat is meat for perdition there was never a chance for you hoover as mrs parker s roomers sat thus one summer s evening miss leeson looked up into the firmament and cried with her little gay laugh why there s billy jackson i can see him from down here too all looked up some at the windows of skyscrapers some casting about for an airship jackson guided it s that star explained miss leeson pointing with a tiny finger not the big one that twinkles the steady blue one near it i can see it every night through my skylight i named it billy jackson well really said miss longnecker i didn t know you were an astronomer miss leeson oh yes said the small star gazer i know as much as any of them about the style of sleeves they re going to wear next fall in mars well really said miss longnecker the star you refer to is gamma of the constellation cassiopeia it is nearly of the second magnitude and its meridian passage is oh said the very young mr evans i think billy jackson is a much better name for it same here said mr hoover loudly breathing defiance to miss longnecker i think miss leeson has just as much right to name stars as any of those old astrologers had well really said miss longnecker i wonder whether it s a shooting star remarked miss dorn i hit nine ducks and a rabbit out of ten in the gallery at coney sunday he doesn t show up very well from down here said miss leeson you ought to see him from my room you know you can see stars even in the

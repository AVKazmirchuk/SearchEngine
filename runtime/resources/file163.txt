everywhere there s anything doing yes i suppose he s a type dress clothes every evening knows the ropes calls every policeman and waiter in town by their first names no he never travels with the hydrogen derivatives you generally see him alone or with another man my friend the reporter left me and i wandered further afield by this time the electric lights on the rialto were alight people passed but they held me not paphian eyes rayed upon me and left me unscathed diners heimgangers shop girls confidence men panhandlers actors highwaymen millionaires and outlanders hurried skipped strolled sneaked swaggered and scurried by me but i took no note of them i knew them all i had read their hearts they had served i wanted my man about town he was a type and to drop him would be an

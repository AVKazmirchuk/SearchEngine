the bowery passed upon you the argot to which you doubtless refer was the invention of certain of your literary dis coverers who invaded the unknown wilds below third avenue and put strange sounds into the mouths of the inhabitants safe in their homes far to the north and west the credulous readers who were beguiled by this new dialect perused and believed like marco polo and mungo park pioneers indeed but ambitious souls who could not draw the line of demarcation between dis covery and invention the literary bones of these explorers are dotting the trackless wastes of the sub way while it is true that after the publication of the mythical language attributed to the dwellers along the bowery certain of its pat phrases and apt metaphors were adopted and to a limited extent used in this locality it was because our people are prompt in assimilating whatever is to their commercial advantage to the tourists who visited our newly discovered clime and who expected a realization of their literary guide books they supplied the demands of the market but perhaps i am wandering from the question in what way can i assist you gentlemen i beg you will believe that the hospitality of the street is extended to all there are i regret to say many catchpenny places of entertainment but i cannot conceive that they would entice you i felt rivington lean somewhat heavily against me say he remarked with uncertain utterance come and have a drink with us thank you but i never drink i find that alcohol even in the smallest quantities alters the perspective and i must preserve my perspective for i am studyinc the bowery i have lived in it nearly thirty years and i am just beginning to understand its heartbeats it is like a great river fed by a hundred alien streams each influx brings strange seeds on its flood strange silt and weeds and now and then a flower of rare promise to construe this river requires a man who can build dykes against the overflow who is a naturalist a geologist a humanitarian a diver and a strong swimmer i love my bowery it was my cradle and is my inspiration i have published one book the critics have been kind i put my heart in it i am writing another into which i hope to put both heart and brain consider me your guide gentlemen is there arything i can take you to see any place to which i can conduct you i was afraid to look at rivington except with one eye thanks said rivington we were looking up that is my friend confound it it s against all precedent you know awfully obliged just the same in case said our friend you would like to meet some of our bowery young men i would be pleased to have you visit the quarters of our east side kappa delta phi society only two blocks east of here awfully sorry said rivington but my friend s got me on the jump to nioht he s a terror when he s out after local colour now there s nothing i would like better than to drop in at the kappa delta phi but some other time we said our farewells and boarded a home bound car we had a rabbit on upper broadway and then i parted with rivington on a street corner well anyhow said he braced and recovered it couldn t have happened anywhere but in little old new york which to say the least was typical of rivington georgia s ruling if you should chance to visit the general land office step into the draughtsmen s room and ask to be shown the map of salado county a leisurely german pos sibly old kampfer himself will bring it to you it will be four feet square on heavy drawing cloth the lettering and the figures will be beautifully clear and distinct the title will be in splendid undecipherable german text ornamented with classic teutonic designs very likely ceres or pomona leaning against the initial letters with cornucopias venting grapes and wieners you must tell him that this is not the map you wish to see that he will kindly bring you its official predecessor he will then say ach so and bring out a map half the size of the first dim old tattered and faded by looking carefully near its northwest corner you will presently come upon the worn contours of chiquito river and maybe if your eyes are good discern the silent witness to this story the commissioner of the land office was of the old style his antique courtesy was too formal for his day he dressed in fine black and there was a suggestion of roman drapery in his long coat skirts his collars were undetached blame haberdashery for the word his tie was a narrow funereal strip tied in the same knot as were his shoe strings his gray hair was a trifle too long behind but he kept it smooth and orderly his face was clean shaven like the old statesmen s most people thought it a stern face but when its official expression was off a few had seen altogether a different countenance especially tender and gentle it had appeared to those who were about him during the last illness of his only child the commissioner had been a widower for years and his life outside his official duties had been so devoted to little georgia that people spoke of it as a touching and admirable thing he was a reserved man and dignified almost to austerity but the child had come below it all and rested upon his very heart so that she scarcely missed the mother s love that had been taken away there was a wonderful companionship between them for she had many of his own

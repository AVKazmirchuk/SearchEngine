of tens of thousands silk and jewels and laces and ornaments and the perfume and music of the fine world of good breeding and taste these were made for woman they are her equitable portion let her keep near them if they are a part of life to her and if she will she is no traitor to herself as esau was for she keeps he birthright and the pottage she earns is often very scant in this atmosphere nancy belonged and she throve in it and ate her frugal meals and schemed over her cheap dresses with a determined and contented mind she already knew woman and she was studying man the animal both as to his habits and eligibility some day she would bring down the game that she wanted but she promised herself it would be what seemed to her the biggest and the best and nothing smaller thus she kept her lamp trimmed and burning to receive the bridegroom when he should come but another lesson she learned perhaps unconsciously her standard of values began to shift and change sometimes the dollar mark grew blurred in her mind s eye and shaped itself into letters that spelled such words as truth and honor and now and then just kindness let us make a likeness of one who hunts the moose or elk in some mighty wood he sees a little dell mossy and embowered where a rill trickles babbling to him of rest and comfort at these times the spear of nimrod himself grows blunt so nancy wondered sometimes if persian lamb was always quoted at its market value by the hearts that it covered one thursday evening nancy left the store and turned across sixth avenue westward to the laundry she was expected to go with lou and dan to a musical comedy dan was just coming out of the laundry when she arrived there was a queer strained look on his face i thought i would drop around to see if they had heard from her he said heard from who asked nancy isn t lou there i thought you knew said dan she hasn t been here or at the house where she lived since monday she moved all her things from there she told one of the girls in the laundry she might be going to europe hasn t anybody seen her anywhere asked nancy dan looked at her with his jaws set grimly and a steely gleam in his steady gray eyes they told me in the laundry he said harshly that they saw her pass yesterday in an automobile with one of the millionaires i suppose that you and lou were forever busying your brains about for the first time nancy quailed before a man she laid her hand that trembled slightly on dan s sleeve you ve no right to say such a thing to me dan as if i had anything to do with it i didn t mean it that way said dan softening he fumbled in his vest pocket i ve got the tickets for the show to night he said with a gallant show of lightness if you nancy admired pluck whenever she saw it i ll go with you dan she said three months went by before nancy saw lou again at twilight one evening the shop girl was hurrying home along the border of a little quiet park she heard her name called and wheeled about in time to catch lou rushing into her arms after the first embrace they drew their heads back as serpents do ready to attack or to charm with a thousand questions trembling on their swift tongues and then nancy noticed that prosperity had descended upon lou manifesting itself in costly furs flashing gems and creations of the tailors art you little fool cried lou loudly and affectionately i see you are still working in that store and as shabby as ever and how about that big catch you were going to make nothing doing yet i suppose and then lou looked and saw that something better than prosperity lead descended upon nancy something that shone brighter than gems in her eyes and redder than a rose in her cheeks and that danced like electricity anxious to be loosed from the tip of her tongue yes i m still in the store said nancy but i m going to leave it next week i ve made my catch the biggest catch in the world you won t mind now lou will you i m going to be married to dan to dan he s my dan now why lou around the corner of the park strolled one of those new crop smooth faced young policemen that are making the force more endurable at least to the eye he saw a woman with an expensive fur coat and diamond ringed hands crouching down against the iron fence of the park sobbing turbulently while a slender plainly dressed working girl leaned close trying to console her but the gibsonian cop being of the new order passed on pretending not to notice for he was wise enough to know that these matters are beyond help so far as the power he represents is concerned though he rap the pavement with his nightstick till the sound goes up to the furthermost stars a madison square arabian night to carson chalmers in his apartment near the square phillips brought the evening mail beside the routine correspondence there were two items bearing the same foreign postmark one of the incoming parcels contained a photograph of a woman the other contained an interminable letter over which chalmers hung absorbed for a long time the letter was from another woman and it contained poisoned barbs sweetly dipped in honey and feathered with innuendoes concerning the photographed woman chalmers tore this letter into a thousand bits and began to wear out his expensive rug by striding back and forth upon it thus an animal from the jungle acts when it is caged and thus a caged man acts when he is housed in a jungle of doubt by and by the restless mood was overcome the rug was not an enchanted one for sixteen feet he could travel along it three thousand miles was beyond its power to aid phillips appeared he never entered he invariably appeared like a well oiled genie will you dine here sir or out he asked here said chalmers and in half an hour he listened glumly to the january blasts making an aeolian trombone of the empty street wait he said to the disappearing genie as i came home across the end of the square i saw many men standing there in rows there was one mounted upon something talking why do those men stand in rows and why are they there they are homeless men sir said phillips the man standing on the box tries to get lodging for them for the night people come around to listen and give him money then he sends as many as the money will pay for to some lodging house that is why they stand in rows they get sent to bed in order as they come by the time dinner is served said chalmers have one of those men here he will dine with me w w which began phillips stammering for the first time during his service choose one at random said chalmers you might see that he is reasonably sober and a certain amount of cleanliness will not be held against him that is all it was an unusual thing for carson chalmers to play the caliph but on that night he felt the inefficacy of conventional antidotes to melancholy something wanton and egregious something high flavored and arabian he must have to lighten his mood on the half hour phillips had finished his duties as slave of the lamp the waiters from the restaurant below had whisked aloft the delectable dinner the dining table laid for two glowed cheerily in the glow of the pink shaded candles and now phillips as though he ushered a cardinal or held in charge a burglar wafted in the shivering guest who had been haled from the line of mendicant lodgers it is a common thing to call such men wrecks if the comparison be used here it is the specific one of a derelict come to grief through fire even yet some flickering combustion illuminated the drifting hulk his face and hands had been recently washed a rite insisted upon by phillips as a memorial to the slaughtered conventions in the candle light he stood a flaw in the decorous fittings of the apartment his face was a sickly white covered almost to the eyes with a stubble the shade of a red irish setter s coat phillips s comb had failed to control the pale brown hair long matted and conformed to the contour of a constantly worn hat his eyes were full of a hopeless tricky defiance like that seen in a cur s that is cornered by his tormentors his shabby coat was buttoned high but a quarter inch of redeeming collar showed above it his manner was singularly free from embarrassment when chalmers rose from his chair across the round dining table if you will oblige me said the host i will be glad to have your company at dinner my name is plumer said the highway guest in harsh and aggressive tones if you re like me you like to know the name of the party you re dining with i was going on to say continued chalmers somewhat hastily that mine is chalmers will you sit opposite plumer of the ruffled plumes bent his knee for phillips to slide the chair beneath him he had an air of having sat at attended boards before phillips set out the anchovies and olives good barked plumer going to be in courses is it all right my jovial ruler of bagdad i m your scheherezade all the way to the toothpicks you re the first caliph with a genuine oriental flavor i ve struck since frost what luck and i was forty third in line i finished counting just as your welcome emissary arrived to bid me to the feast i had about as much chance of getting a bed to night as i have of being the next president how will you have the sad story of my life mr al raschid a chapter with each course or the whole edition with the cigars and coffee the situation does not seem a novel one to you said chalmers with a smile by the chin whiskers of the prophet no answered the guest now york s as full of cheap haroun al raschids as bagdad is of fleas i ve been held up for my story with a loaded meal pointed at my head twenty times catch anybody in new york giving you something for nothing they spell curiosity and charity with the same set of building blocks lots of em will stake you to a dime and chop suey and a few of em will play caliph to the tune of a top sirloin but every one of em will stand over you till they screw your autobiography out of you with foot notes appendix and unpublished fragments oh i know what to do when i see victuals coming toward me in little old bagdad on the subway i strike the asphalt three times with my forehead and get ready to spiel yarns for my supper i claim descent from the late tommy tucker who was forced to hand out vocal harmony for his pre digested wheaterina and spoopju i do not ask your story said chalmers i tell you frankly that it was a sudden whim that prompted me to send for some stranger to dine with me i assure you you will not suffer through any curiosity of mine oh fudge exclaimed the guest enthusiastically tackling his soup i don t mind it a bit i m a regular oriental magazine with a red cover and the leaves cut when the caliph walks abroad in fact we fellows in the bed line have a sort of union rate for things of this sort somebody s always stopping and wanting to know what brought us down so low in the world for a sandwich and a glass of beer i tell em that drink did it for corned beef and cabbage and a cup of coffee i give em the hard hearted landlord six months in the hospital lost job story a sirloin steak and a quarter for a bed gets the wall street tragedy of the swept away fortune and the gradual descent this is the first spread of this kind i ve stumbled against i haven t got a story to fit it i ll tell you what mr chalmers i m going to tell you the truth for this if you ll listen to it it ll be harder for you to believe than the made up ones an hour later the arabian guest lay back with a sigh of satisfaction while phillips brought the coffee and cigars and cleared the table did you ever hear of sherrard plumer he asked with a strange smile i remember the name said chalmers he was a painter i think of a good deal of prominence a few years ago five years said the guest then i went down like a chunk of lead i m sherrard plumer i sold the last portrait i painted for after that i couldn t have found a sitter for a gratis picture what was the trouble chalmers could not resist asking funny thing answered plumer grimly never quite understood it myself for a while i swam like a cork i broke into the swell crowd and got commissions right and left the newspapers called me a fashionable painter then the funny things began to happen whenever i finished a picture people would come to see it and whisper and look queerly at one another i soon found out what the trouble was i had a knack of bringing out in the face of a portrait the hidden character of the original i don t know how i did it i painted what i saw but i know it did me some of my sitters were fearfully enraged and refused their pictures i painted the portrait of a very beautiful and popular society dame when it was finished her husband looked at it with a peculiar expression on his face and the next week he sued for divorce i remember one case of a prominent banker who sat to me while i had his portrait on exhibition in my studio an acquaintance of his came in to look at it bless me says he does he really look like that i told him it was considered a faithful likeness i never noticed that expression about his eyes before said he i think i ll drop downtown and change my bank account he did drop down but the bank account was gone and so was mr banker it wasn t long till they put me out of business people don t want their secret meannesses shown up in a picture they can smile and twist their own faces and deceive you but the picture can t i couldn t get an order for another picture and i had to give up i worked as a newspaper artist for a while and then for a lithographer but my work with them got me into the same trouble if i drew from a photograph my drawing showed up characteristics and expressions that you couldn t find in the photo but i guess they were in the original all right the customers raised lively rows especially the women and i never could hold a job long so i began to rest my weary head upon the breast of old booze for comfort and pretty soon i was in the free bed line and doing oral fiction for hand outs among the food bazaars does the truthful statement weary thee o caliph i can turn on the wall street disaster stop if you prefer but that requires a tear and i m afraid i can t hustle one up after that good dinner no no said chalmers earnestly you interest me very much did all of your portraits reveal some unpleasant trait or were there some that did not suffer from the ordeal of your peculiar brush some yes said plumer children generally a good many women and a sufficient number of men all people aren t bad you know when they were all right the pictures were all right as i said i don t explain it but i m telling you facts on chalmers s writing table lay the photograph that he had received that day in the foreign mail ten minutes later he had plumer at work making a sketch from it in pastels at the end of an hour the artist rose and stretched wearily it s done he yawned you ll excuse me for being so long i got interested in the job lordy but i m tired no bed last night you know guess it ll have to be good night now o commander of the faithful chalmers went as far as the door with him and slipped some bills into his hand oh i ll take em said plumer all that s included in the fall thanks and for the very good dinner i shall sleep on feathers to night and dream of bagdad i hope it won t turn out to be a dream in the morning farewell most excellent caliph again chalmers paced restlessly upon his rug but his beat lay as far from the table whereon lay the pastel sketch as the room would permit twice thrice he tried to approach it but failed he could see the dun and gold and brown of the colors but there was a wall about it built by his fears that kept him at a distance he sat down and tried to calm himself he sprang up and rang for phillips there is a young artist in this building he said a mr reineman do you know which is his apartment top floor front sir said phillips go up and ask him to favor me with his presence here for a few minutes reineman came at once chalmers introduced himself mr reineman said he there is a little pastel sketch on yonder table i would be glad if you will give me your opinion of it as to its artistic merits and as a picture the young artist advanced to the table and took up the sketch chalmers half turned away leaning upon the back of a chair how do you find it he asked slowly as a drawing said the artist i can t praise it enough it s the work of a master bold and fine and true it puzzles me a little i haven t seen any pastel work near as good in years the face man the subject the original what would you say of that the face said reineman is the face of one of god s own angels may i ask who my wife shouted chalmers wheeling and pouncing upon the astonished artist gripping his hand and pounding his back she is traveling in europe take that sketch boy and paint the picture of your life from it and leave the price to me the rubaiyat of a scotch highball this document is intended to strike somewhere between a temperance lecture and the bartender s guide relative to the latter drink shall swell the theme and be set forth in abundance agreeably to the former not an elbow shall be crooked bob babbitt was off the stuff which means as you will discover by referring to the unabridged dictionary of bohemia that he had cut out the booze that he was on the water wagon the reason for bob s sudden attitude of hostility toward the demon rum as the white ribboners miscall whiskey see the bartender s guide should be of interest to reformers and saloon keepers there is always hope for a man who when sober will not concede or acknowledge that he was ever drunk but when a man will say in the apt words of the phrase distiller i had a beautiful skate on last night you will have to put stuff in his coffee as well as pray for him one evening on his way home babbitt dropped in at the broadway bar that he liked best always there were three or four fellows there from the downtown offices whom he knew and then there would be high balls and stories and he would hurry home to dinner a little late but feeling good and a little sorry for the poor standard oil company on this evening as he entered he heard some one say babbitt was in last night as full as a boiled owl babbitt walked to the bar and saw in the mirror that his face was as white as chalk for the first time he had looked truth in the eyes others had lied to him he had dissembled with himself he was a drunkard and had not known it what he had fondly imagined was a pleasant exhilaration had been maudlin intoxication his fancied wit had been drivel his gay humors nothing but the noisy vagaries of a sot but never again a glass of seltzer he said to the bartender a little silence fell upon the group of his cronies who had been expecting him to join them going off the stuff bob one of them asked politely and with more formality than the highballs ever called forth yes said babbitt some one of the group took up the unwashed thread of a story he had been telling the bartender shoved over a dime and a nickel change from the quarter ungarnished with his customary smile and babbitt walked out now babbitt had a home and a wife but that is another story and i will tell you that story which will show you a better habit and a worse story than you could find in the man who invented the phrase it began away up in sullivan county where so many rivers and so much trouble begins or begin how would you say that it was july and jessie was a summer boarder at the mountain squint hotel and bob who was just out of college saw her one day and they were married in september that s the tabloid novel one swallow of water and it s gone but those july days let the exclamation point expound it for i shall not for particulars you might read up on romeo and juliet and abraham lincoln s thrilling sonnet about you can fool some of the people c and darwin s works but one thing i must tell you about both of them were mad over omar s rubaiyat they knew every verse of the old bluffer by heart not consecutively but picking em out here and there as you fork the mushrooms in a fifty cent steak a la bordelaise sullivan county is full of rocks and trees and jessie used to sit on them and please be good used to sit on the rocks and bob had a way of standing behind her with his hands over her shoulders holding her hands and his face close to hers and they would repeat over and over their favorite verses of the old tent maker they saw only the poetry and philosophy of the lines then indeed they agreed that the wine was only an image and that what was meant to be celebrated was some divinity or maybe love or life however at that time neither of them had tasted the stuff that goes with a sixty cent table d hote where was i oh they married and came to new york bob showed his college diploma and accepted a position filling inkstands in a lawyer s office at a week at the end of two years he had worked up to and gotten his first taste of bohemia the kind that won t stand the borax and formaldehyde tests they had two furnished rooms and a little kitchen to jess accustomed to the mild but beautiful savor of a country town the dreggy bohemia was sugar and spice she hung fish seines on the walls of her rooms and bought a rakish looking sideboard and learned to play the banjo twice or thrice a week they dined at french or italian tables d hote in a cloud of smoke and brag and unshorn hair jess learned to drink a cocktail in order to get the cherry at home she smoked a cigarette after dinner she learned to pronounce chianti and leave her olive stones for the waiter to pick up once she essayed to say la la la in a crowd but got only as far as the second one they met one or two couples while dining out and became friendly with them the sideboard was stocked with scotch and rye and a liqueur they had their new friends in to dinner and all were laughing at nothing by a m some plastering fell in the room below them for which bob had to pay thus they footed it merrily on the ragged frontiers of the country that has no boundary lines or government and soon bob fell in with his cronies and learned to keep his foot on the little rail six inches above the floor for an hour or so every afternoon before he went home drink always rubbed him the right way and he would reach his rooms as jolly as a sandboy jessie would meet him at the door and generally they would dance some insane kind of a rigadoon about the floor by way of greeting once when bob s feet became confused and he tumbled headlong over a foot stool jessie laughed so heartily and long that he had to throw all the couch pillows at her to make her hush in such wise life was speeding for them on the day when bob babbitt first felt the power that the giftie gi ed him but let us get back to our lamb and mint sauce when bob got home that evening he found jessie in a long apron cutting up a lobster for the newburg usually when bob came in mellow from his hour at the bar his welcome was hilarious though somewhat tinctured with scotch smoke by screams and snatches of song and certain audible testimonials of domestic felicity was his advent proclaimed when she heard his foot on the stairs the old maid in the hall room always stuffed cotton into her ears at first jessie had shrunk from the rudeness and favor of these spiritual greetings but as the fog of the false bohemia gradually encompassed her she came to accept them as love s true and proper greeting bob came in without a word smiled kissed her neatly but noiselessly took up a paper and sat down in the hall room the old maid held her two plugs of cotton poised filled with anxiety jessie dropped lobster and knife and ran to him with frightened eyes what s the matter bob are you ill not at all dear then what s the matter with you nothing hearken brethren when she who has a right to ask interrogates you concerning a change she finds in your mood answer her thus tell her that you in a sudden rage have murdered your grandmother tell her that you have robbed orphans and that remorse has stricken you tell her your fortune is swept away that you are beset by enemies by bunions by any kind of malevolent fate but do not if peace and happiness are worth as much as a grain of mustard seed to you do not answer her nothing jessie went back to the lobster in silence she cast looks of darkest suspicion at bob he had never acted that way before when dinner was on the table she set out the bottle of scotch and the glasses bob declined tell you the truth jess he said i ve cut out the drink help yourself of course if you don t mind i ll try some of the seltzer straight you ve stopped drinking she said looking at him steadily and unsmilingly what for it wasn t doing me any good said bob don t you approve of the idea jessie raised her eyebrows and one shoulder slightly entirely she said with a sculptured smile i could not conscientiously advise any one to drink or smoke or whistle on sunday the meal was finished almost in silence bob tried to make talk but his efforts lacked the stimulus of previous evenings he felt miserable and once or twice his eye wandered toward the bottle but each time the scathing words of his bibulous friend sounded in his ear and his mouth set with determination jessie felt the change deeply the essence of their lives seemed to have departed suddenly the restless fever the false gayety the unnatural excitement of the shoddy bohemia in which they had lived had dropped away in the space of the popping of a cork she stole curious and forlorn glances at the dejected bob who bore the guilty look of at least a wife beater or a family tyrant after dinner the colored maid who came in daily to perform such chores cleared away the things jessie with an unreadable countenance brought back the bottle of scotch and the glasses and a bowl of cracked ice and set them on the table may i ask she said with some of the ice in her tones whether i am to be included in your sudden spasm of goodness if not i ll make one for myself it s rather chilly this evening for some reason oh come now jess said bob good naturedly don t be too rough on me help yourself by all means there s no danger of your overdoing it but i thought there was with me and that s why i quit have yours and then let s get out the banjo and try over that new quickstep i ve heard said jessie in the tones of the oracle that drinking alone is a pernicious habit no i don t think i feel like playing this evening if we are going to reform we may as well abandon the evil habit of banjo playing too she took up a book and sat in her little willow rocker on the other side of the table neither of them spoke for half an hour and then bob laid down his paper and got up with a strange absent look on his face and went behind her chair and reached over her shoulders taking her hands in his and laid his face close to hers in a moment to jessie the walls of the seine hung room vanished and she saw the sullivan county hills and rills bob felt her hands quiver in his as he began the verse from old omar come fill the cup and in the fire of spring the winter garment of repentance fling the bird of time has but a little way to fly and lo the bird is on the wing and then he walked to the table and poured a stiff drink of scotch into a glass but in that moment a mountain breeze had somehow found its way in and blown away the mist of the false bohemia jessie leaped and with one fierce sweep of her hand sent the bottle and glasses crashing to the floor the same motion of her arm carried it around bob s neck where it met its mate and fastened tight oh my god bobbie not that verse i see now i wasn t always such a fool was i the other one boy the one that says remould it to the heart s desire say that one to the heart s desire i know that one said bob it goes ah love could you and i with him conspire to grasp this sorry scheme of things entire would not we let me finish it said jessie would not we shatter it to bits and then remould it nearer to the heart s desire it s shattered all right said bob crunching some glass under his heel in some dungeon below the accurate ear of mrs pickens the landlady located the smash it s that wild mr babbitt coming home soused again she said and he s got such a nice little wife too the pendulum eighty first street let em out please yelled the shepherd in blue a flock of citizen sheep scrambled out and another flock scrambled aboard ding ding the cattle cars of the manhattan elevated rattled away and john perkins drifted down the stairway of the station with the released flock john walked slowly toward his flat slowly because in the lexicon of his daily life there was no such word as perhaps there are no surprises awaiting a man who has been married two years and lives in a flat as he walked john perkins prophesied to himself with gloomy and downtrodden cynicism the foregone conclusions of the monotonous day katy would meet him at the door with a kiss flavored with cold cream and butter scotch he would remove his coat sit upon a macadamized lounge and read in the evening paper of russians and japs slaughtered by the deadly linotype for dinner there would be pot roast a salad flavored with a dressing warranted not to crack or injure the leather stewed rhubarb and the bottle of strawberry marmalade blushing at the certificate of chemical purity on its label after dinner katy would show him the new patch in her crazy quilt that the iceman had cut for her off the end of his four in hand at half past seven they would spread newspapers over the furniture to catch the pieces of plastering that fell when the fat man in the flat overhead began to take his physical culture exercises exactly at eight hickey mooney of the vaudeville team unbooked in the flat across the hall would yield to the gentle influence of delirium tremens and begin to overturn chairs under the delusion that hammerstein was pursuing them with a five hundred dollar a week contract then the gent at the window across the air shaft would get out his flute the nightly gas leak would steal forth to frolic in the highways the dumbwaiter would slip off its trolley the janitor would drive mrs zanowitski s five children once more across the yalu the lady with the champagne shoes and the skye terrier would trip downstairs and paste her thursday name over her bell and letter box and the evening routine of the frogmore flats would be under way john perkins knew these things would happen and he knew that at a quarter past eight he would summon his nerve and reach for his hat and that his wife would deliver this speech in a querulous tone now where are you going i d like to know john perkins thought i d drop up to mccloskey s he would answer and play a game or two of pool with the fellows of late such had been john perkins s habit at ten or eleven he would return sometimes katy would be asleep sometimes waiting up ready to melt in the crucible of her ire a little more gold plating from the wrought steel chains of matrimony for these things cupid will have to answer when he stands at the bar of justice with his victims from the frogmore flats to night john perkins encountered a tremendous upheaval of the commonplace when he reached his door no katy was there with her affectionate confectionate kiss the three rooms seemed in portentous disorder all about lay her things in confusion shoes in the middle of the floor curling tongs hair bows kimonos powder box jumbled together on dresser and chairs this was not katy s way with a sinking heart john saw the comb with a curling cloud of her brown hair among its teeth some unusual hurry and perturbation must have possessed her for she always carefully placed these combings in the little blue vase on the mantel to be some day formed into the coveted feminine rat hanging conspicuously to the gas jet by a string was a folded paper john seized it it was a note from his wife running thus dear john i just had a telegram saying mother is very sick i am going to take the train brother sam is going to meet me at the depot there there is cold mutton in the ice box i hope it isn t her quinzy again pay the milkman cents she had it bad last spring don t forget to write to the company about the gas meter and your good socks are in the top drawer i will write to morrow hastily katy never during their two years of matrimony had he and katy been separated for a night john read the note over and over in a dumbfounded way here was a break in a routine that had never varied and it left him dazed there on the back of a chair hung pathetically empty and formless the red wrapper with black dots that she always wore while getting the meals her week day clothes had been tossed here and there in her haste a little paper bag of her favorite butterscotch lay with its string yet unwound a daily paper sprawled on the floor gaping rectangularly where a railroad time table had been clipped from it everything in the room spoke of a loss of an essence gone of its soul and life departed john perkins stood among the dead remains with a queer feeling of desolation in his heart he began to set the rooms tidy as well as he could when he touched her clothes a thrill of something like terror went through him he had never thought what existence would be without katy she had become so thoroughly annealed into his life that she was like the air he breathed necessary but scarcely noticed now without warning she was gone vanished as completely absent as if she had never existed of course it would be only for a few days or at most a week or two but it seemed to him as if the very hand of death had pointed a finger at his secure and uneventful home john dragged the cold mutton from the ice box made coffee and sat down to a lonely meal face to face with the strawberry marmalade s shameless certificate of purity bright among withdrawn blessings now appeared to him the ghosts of pot roasts and the salad with tan polish dressing his home was dismantled a quinzied mother in law had knocked his lares and penates sky high after his solitary meal john sat at a front window he did not care to smoke outside the city roared to him to come join in its dance of folly and pleasure the night was his he might go forth unquestioned and thrum the strings of jollity as free as any gay bachelor there he might carouse and wander and have his fling until dawn if he liked and there would be no wrathful katy waiting for him bearing the chalice that held the dregs of his joy he might play pool at mccloskey s with his roistering friends until aurora dimmed the electric bulbs if he chose the hymeneal strings that had curbed him always when the frogmore flats had palled upon him were loosened katy was gone john perkins was not accustomed to analyzing his emotions but as he sat in his katy bereft x parlor he hit unerringly upon the keynote of his discomfort he knew now that katy was necessary to his happiness his feeling for her lulled into unconsciousness by the dull round of domesticity had been sharply stirred by the loss of her presence has it not been dinned into us by proverb and sermon and fable that we never prize the music till the sweet voiced bird has flown or in other no less florid and true utterances i m a double dyed dub mused john perkins the way i ve been treating katy off every night playing pool and bumming with the boys instead of staying home with her the poor girl here all alone with nothing to amuse her and me acting that way john perkins you re the worst kind of a shine i m going to make it up for the little girl i ll take her out and let her see some amusement and i ll cut out the mccloskey gang right from this minute yes there was the city roaring outside for john perkins to come dance in the train of momus and at mccloskey s the boys were knocking the balls idly into the pockets against the hour for the nightly game but no primrose way nor clicking cue could woo the remorseful soul of perkins the bereft the thing that was his lightly held and half scorned had been taken away from him and he wanted it backward to a certain man named adam whom the cherubim bounced from the orchard could perkins the remorseful trace his descent near the right hand of john perkins stood a chair on the back of it stood katy s blue shirtwaist it still retained something of her contour midway of the sleeves were fine individual wrinkles made by the movements of her arms in working for his comfort and pleasure a delicate but impelling odor of bluebells came from it john took it and looked long and soberly at the unresponsive grenadine katy had never been unresponsive tears yes tears came into john perkins s eyes when she came back things would be different he would make up for all his neglect what was life without her the door opened katy walked in carrying a little hand satchel john stared at her stupidly my i m glad to get back said katy ma wasn t sick to amount to anything sam was at the depot and said she just had a little spell and got all right soon after they telegraphed so i took the next train back i m just dying for a cup of coffee nobody heard the click and rattle of the cog wheels as the third floor front of the frogmore flats buzzed its machinery back into the order of things a band slipped a spring was touched the gear was adjusted and the wheels revolve in their old orbit john perkins looked at the clock it was he reached for his hat and walked to the door now where are you going i d like to know john perkins asked katy in a querulous tone thought i d drop up to mccloskey s said john and play a game or two of pool with the fellows two thanksgiving day gentlemen there is one day that is ours there is one day when all we americans who are not self made go back to the old home to eat saleratus biscuits and marvel how much nearer to the porch the old pump looks than it used to bless the day president roosevelt gives it to us we hear some talk of the puritans but don t just remember who they were bet we can lick em anyhow if they try to land again plymouth rocks well that sounds more familiar lots of us have had to come down to hens since the turkey trust got its work in but somebody in washington is leaking out advance information to em about these thanksgiving proclamations the big city east of the cranberry bogs has made thanksgiving day an institution the last thursday in november is the only day in the year on which it recognizes the part of america lying across the ferries it is the one day that is purely american yes a day of celebration exclusively american and now for the story which is to prove to you that we have traditions on this side of the ocean that are becoming older at a much rapider rate than those of england are thanks to our git up and enterprise stuffy pete took his seat on the third bench to the right as you enter union square from the east at the walk opposite the fountain every thanksgiving day for nine years he had taken his seat there promptly at o clock for every time he had done so things had happened to him charles dickensy things that swelled his waistcoat above his heart and equally on the other side but to day stuffy pete s appearance at the annual trysting place seemed to have been rather the result of habit than of the yearly hunger which as the philanthropists seem to think afflicts the poor at such extended intervals certainly pete was not hungry he had just come from a feast that had left him of his powers barely those of respiration and locomotion his eyes were like two pale gooseberries firmly imbedded in a swollen and gravy smeared mask of putty his breath came in short wheezes a senatorial roll of adipose tissue denied a fashionable set to his upturned coat collar buttons that had been sewed upon his clothes by kind salvation fingers a week before flew like popcorn strewing the earth around him ragged he was with a split shirt front open to the wishbone but the november breeze carrying fine snowflakes brought him only a grateful coolness for stuffy pete was overcharged with the caloric produced by a superbountiful dinner beginning with oysters and ending with plum pudding and including it seemed to him all the roast turkey and baked potatoes and chicken salad and squash pie and ice cream in the world wherefore he sat gorged and gazed upon the world with after dinner contempt the meal had been an unexpected one he was passing a red brick mansion near the beginning of fifth avenue in which lived two old ladies of ancient family and a reverence for traditions they even denied the existence of new york and believed that thanksgiving day was declared solely for washington square one of their traditional habits was to station a servant at the postern gate with orders to admit the first hungry wayfarer that came along after the hour of noon had struck and banquet him to a finish stuffy pete happened to pass by on his way to the park and the seneschals gathered him in and upheld the custom of the castle after stuffy pete had gazed straight before him for ten minutes he was conscious of a desire for a more varied field of vision with a tremendous effort he moved his head slowly to the left and then his eyes bulged out fearfully and his breath ceased and the rough shod ends of his short legs wriggled and rustled on the gravel for the old gentleman was coming across fourth avenue toward his bench every thanksgiving day for nine years the old gentleman had come there and found stuffy pete on his bench that was a thing that the old gentleman was trying to make a tradition of every thanksgiving day for nine years he had found stuffy there and had led him to a restaurant and watched him eat a big dinner they do those things in england unconsciously but this is a young country and nine years is not so bad the old gentleman was a staunch american patriot and considered himself a pioneer in american tradition in order to become picturesque we must keep on doing one thing for a long time without ever letting it get away from us something like collecting the weekly dimes in industrial insurance or cleaning the streets the old gentleman moved straight and stately toward the institution that he was rearing truly the annual feeling of stuffy pete was nothing national in its character such as the magna charta or jam for breakfast was in england but it was a step it was almost feudal it showed at least that a custom was not impossible to new y ahem america the old gentleman was thin and tall and sixty he was dressed all in black and wore the old fashioned kind of glasses that won t stay on your nose his hair was whiter and thinner than it had been last year and he seemed to make more use of his big knobby cane with the crooked handle as his established benefactor came up stuffy wheezed and shuddered like some woman s over fat pug when a street dog bristles up at him he would have flown but all the skill of santos dumont could not have separated him from his bench well had the myrmidons of the two old ladies done their work good morning said the old gentleman i am glad to perceive that the vicissitudes of another year have spared you to move in health about the beautiful world for that blessing alone this day of thanksgiving is well proclaimed to each of us if you will come with me my man i will provide you with a dinner that should make your physical being accord with the mental that is what the old gentleman said every time every thanksgiving day for nine years the words themselves almost formed an institution nothing could be compared with them except the declaration of independence always before they had been music in stuffy s ears but now he looked up at the old gentleman s face with tearful agony in his own the fine snow almost sizzled when it fell upon his perspiring brow but the old gentleman shivered a little and turned his back to the wind stuffy had always wondered why the old gentleman spoke his speech rather sadly he did not know that it was because he was wishing every time that he had a son to succeed him a son who would come there after he was gone a son who would stand proud and strong before some subsequent stuffy and say in memory of my father then it would be an institution but the old gentleman had no relatives he lived in rented rooms in one of the decayed old family brownstone mansions in one of the quiet streets east of the park in the winter he raised fuchsias in a little conservatory the size of a steamer trunk in the spring he walked in the easter parade in the summer he lived at a farmhouse in the new jersey hills and sat in a wicker armchair speaking of a butterfly the ornithoptera amphrisius that he hoped to find some day in the autumn he fed stuffy a dinner these were the old gentleman s occupations stuffy pete looked up at him for a half minute stewing and helpless in his own self pity the old gentleman s eyes were bright with the giving pleasure his face was getting more lined each year but his little black necktie was in as jaunty a bow as ever and the linen was beautiful and white and his gray mustache was curled carefully at the ends and then stuffy made a noise that sounded like peas bubbling in a pot speech was intended and as the old gentleman had heard the sounds nine times before he rightly construed them into stuffy s old formula of acceptance thankee sir i ll go with ye and much obliged i m very hungry sir the coma of repletion had not prevented from entering stuffy s mind the conviction that he was the basis of an institution his thanksgiving appetite was not his own it belonged by all the sacred rights of established custom if not by the actual statute of limitations to this kind old gentleman who bad preempted it true america is free but in order to establish tradition some one must be a repetend a repeating decimal the heroes are not all heroes of steel and gold see one here that wielded only weapons of iron badly silvered and tin the old gentleman led his annual protege southward to the restaurant and to the table where the feast had always occurred they were recognized here comes de old guy said a waiter dat blows dat same bum to a meal every thanksgiving the old gentleman sat across the table glowing like a smoked pearl at his corner stone of future ancient tradition the waiters heaped the table with holiday food and stuffy with a sigh that was mistaken for hunger s expression raised knife and fork and carved for himself a crown of imperishable bay no more valiant hero ever fought his way through the ranks of an enemy turkey chops soups vegetables pies disappeared before him as fast as they could be served gorged nearly to the uttermost when he entered the restaurant the smell of food had almost caused him to lose his honor as a gentleman but he rallied like a true knight he saw the look of beneficent happiness on the old gentleman s face a happier look than even the fuchsias and the ornithoptera aniphrisins had ever brought to it and he had not the heart to see it wane in an hour stuffy leaned back with a battle won thankee kindly sir he puffed like a leaky steam pipe thankee kindly for a hearty meal then he arose heavily with glazed eyes and started toward the kitchen a waiter turned him about like a top and pointed him toward the door the old gentleman carefully counted out in silver change leaving three nickels for the waiter they parted as they did each year at the door the old gentleman going south stuffy north around the first corner stuffy turned and stood for one minute then he seemed to puff out his rags as an owl puffs out his feathers and fell to the sidewalk like a sunstricken horse when the ambulance came the young surgeon and the driver cursed softly at his weight there was no smell of whiskey to justify a transfer to the patrol wagon so stuffy and his two dinners went to the hospital there they stretched him on a bed and began to test him for strange diseases with the hope of getting a chance at some problem with the bare steel and lo an hour later another ambulance brought the old gentleman and they laid him on another bed and spoke of appendicitis for he looked good for the bill but pretty soon one of the young doctors met one of the young nurses whose eyes he liked and stopped to chat with her about the cases that nice old gentleman over there now he said you wouldn t think that was a case of almost starvation proud old family i guess he told me he hadn t eaten a thing for three days the assessor of success hastings beauchamp morley sauntered across union square with a pitying look at the hundreds that lolled upon the park benches they were a motley lot he thought the men with stolid animal unshaven faces the women wriggling and self conscious twining and untwining their feet that hung four inches above the gravelled walks were i mr carnegie or mr rockefeller i would put a few millions in my inside pocket and make an appointment with all the park commissioners around the corner if necessary and arrange for benches in all the parks of the world low enough for women to sit upon and rest their feet upon the ground after that i might furnish libraries to towns that would pay for em or build sanitariums for crank professors and call em colleges if i wanted to women s rights societies have been laboring for many years after equality with man with what result when they sit on a bench they must twist their ankles together and uncomfortably swing their highest french heels clear of earthly support begin at the bottom ladies get your feet on the ground and then rise to theories of mental equality hastings beauchamp morley was carefully and neatly dressed that was the result of an instinct due to his birth and breeding it is denied us to look further into a man s bosom than the starch on his shirt front so it is left to us only to recount his walks and conversation morley had not a cent in his pockets but he smiled pityingly at a hundred grimy unfortunate ones who had no more and who would have no more when the sun s first rays yellowed the tall paper cutter building on the west side of the square but morley would have enough by then sundown had seen his pockets empty before but sunrise had always seen them lined first he went to the house of a clergyman off madison avenue and presented a forged letter of introduction that holily purported to issue from a pastorate in indiana this netted him when backed up by a realistic romance of a delayed remittance on the sidewalk twenty steps from the clergyman s door a pale faced fat man huskily enveloped him with a raised red fist and the voice of a bell buoy demanding payment of an old score why bergman man sang morley dulcetly is this you i was just on my way up to your place to settle up that remittance from my aunt arrived only this morning wrong address was the trouble come up to the corner and i ll square up glad to see you saves me a walk four drinks placated the emotional bergman there was an air about morley when he was backed by money in hand that would have stayed off a call loan at rothschilds when he was penniless his bluff was pitched half a tone lower but few are competent to detect the difference in the notes you gum to mine blace and bay me to morrow mr morley said bergman oxcuse me dat i dun you on der street but i haf not seen you in dree mont pros t morley walked away with a crooked smile on his pale smooth face the credulous drink softened german amused him he would have to avoid twenty ninth street in the future he had not been aware that bergman ever went home by that route at the door of a darkened house two squares to the north morley knocked with a peculiar sequence of raps the door opened to the length of a six inch chain and the pompous important black face of

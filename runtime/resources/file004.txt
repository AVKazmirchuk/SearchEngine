grande country rode in sight of the nopalito ranch house and felt hunger assail him ex consuetudine he was soon seated at the mid day dining table of that hospitable kingdom talk like water gushed from him he might have been smitten with aaron s rod that is your gentle shepherd when an audience is vouchsafed him whose ears are not overgrown with wool missis yeager he babbled i see a man the other day on the rancho seco down in hidalgo county by your name webb yeager was his he d just been engaged as manager he was a tall light haired man not saying much perhaps he was some kin of yours do you think a husband said santa cordially the seco has done well mr yeager is one of the best stockmen in the west the dropping out of a prince consort rarely disorganises a monarchy queen santa had appointed as mayordomo of the ranch a trusty subject named ramsay who had been one of her father s faithful vassals and there was scarcely a ripple on the nopalito ranch save when the gulf breeze created undulations in the grass of its wide acres for several years the nopalito had been making experiments with an english breed of cattle that looked down with aristocratic contempt upon the texas long horns the experiments were found satisfactory and a pasture had been set aside for the blue bloods the fame of them had gone forth into the chaparral and pear as far as men ride in saddles other ranches woke up rubbed their eyes and looked with new dissatisfaction upon the long horns as a consequence one day a sunburned capable silk kerchiefed nonchalant youth garnished with revolvers and attended by three mexican vaqueros alighted at the nopalito ranch and presented the following business like epistle to the queen thereof mrs yeager the nopalito ranch dear madam i am instructed by the owners of the rancho seco to purchase head of two and three year old cows of the sussex breed owned by you if you can fill the order please deliver the cattle to the bearer and a check will be forwarded to you at once respectfully webster yeager manager the rancho seco business is business even very scantily did it escape being written especially in a kingdom that night the head of cattle were driven up from the pasture and penned in a corral near the ranch house for delivery in the morning when night closed down and the house was still did santa yeager throw herself down clasping that formal note to her bosom weeping and calling out a name that pride either in one or the other had kept from her lips many a day or did she file the letter in her business way retaining her royal balance and strength wonder if you will but royalty is sacred and there is a veil but this much you shall learn at midnight santa slipped softly out of the ranch house clothed in something dark and plain she paused for a moment under the live oak trees the prairies were somewhat dim and the moonlight was pale orange diluted with particles of an impalpable flying mist but the mock bird whistled on every bough of vantage leagues of flowers scented the air and a kindergarten of little shadowy rabbits leaped and played in an open space near by santa turned her face to the southeast and threw three kisses thitherward for there was none to see then she sped silently to the blacksmith shop fifty yards away and what she did there can only be surmised but the forge glowed red and there was a faint hammering such as cupid might make when he sharpens his arrow points later she came forth with a queer shaped handled thing in one hand and a portable furnace such as are seen in branding camps in the other to the corral where the sussex cattle were penned she sped with these things swiftly in the moonlight she opened the gate and slipped inside the corral the sussex cattle were mostly a dark red but among this bunch was one that was milky white notable among the others and now santa shook from her shoulder something that we had not seen before a rope lasso she freed the loop of it coiling the length in her left hand and plunged into the thick of the cattle the white cow was her object she swung the lasso which caught one horn and slipped off the next throw encircled the forefeet and the animal fell heavily santa made for it like a panther but it scrambled up and dashed against her knocking her over like a blade of grass again she made her cast while the aroused cattle milled around the four sides of the corral in a plunging mass this throw was fair the white cow came to earth again and before it could rise santa had made the lasso fast around a post of the corral with a swift and simple knot and had leaped upon the cow again with the rawhide hobbles in one minute the feet of the animal were tied no record breaking deed and santa leaned against the corral for the same space of time panting and lax and then she ran swiftly to her furnace at the gate and brought the branding iron queerly shaped and white hot the bellow of the outraged white cow as the iron was applied should have stirred the slumbering auricular nerves and consciences of the near by subjects of the nopalito but it did not and it was amid the deepest nocturnal silence that santa ran like a lapwing back to the ranch house and there fell upon a cot and sobbed sobbed as though queens had hearts as simple ranchmen s wives have and as though she would gladly make kings of prince consorts should they ride back

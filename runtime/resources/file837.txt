estate interrupted octavia emphasizing her words with appropriate dramatic ges tures is of spanish castellar architecture colonel beaupree s resources are wind colonel beaupree s stocks are water colonel beaupree s income is all in the statement lacks the legal technicalities to which i have been listening for an hour but that is what it means when translated octavia aunt ellen was now visibly possessed by consternation i can hardly believe it and it was the impression that he was worth a million and the de peysters themselves introduced him octavia rippled out a laugh and then became properly grave de mortuis nil auntie not even the rest of it the dear old colonel what a gold brick he was after all i paid for my bargain fairly i m all here am i not items eyes fingers toes youth old family unques tionable position in society as called for in the contract no wild cat stock here octavia picked up the morning paper from the floor but i m not going to squeal isn t that what they

dresser could not be said to want for anything of course chamber maids cooks canvassers stenographers dear said aunt ellen with a little tremor in her voice please do not talk in that way even if your affairs are in so unfortunate a condition there is my three thousand octavia sprang up lithely and deposited a smart kiss on the delicate cheek of the prim little elderly maid blessed auntie your three thousand is just sufficient to insure your hyson to be free from willow leaves and keep the persian in sterilized cream i know i d be welcome but i prefer to strike bottom like beelzebub rather

those stupid papers he made me bring away with me from his office i ll try to find it octavia found her shopping bag and drew from it a long envelope filled with typewritten documents a ranch in texas sighed aunt ellen it sounds to me more like a liability than an asset those are the places where the centipedes are found and cowboys and fandangos the rancho de las sombras read octavia from a sheet of violently purple typewriting is situated one hundred and ten miles southeast of san antonio and thirty eight miles from its nearest railroad station nopal on the i and g n ranch consists of acres of well watered land with title conferred by state patents and twenty two sections or acres partly under yearly running lease and partly bought under state s twenty year purchase act eight thousand graded merino sheep with the necessary equipment of horses vehicles and general ranch paraphernalia ranch house built of brick with six rooms comfortably furnished according to the requirements of the climate all within a strong barbed wire fence the present ranch manager seems to be competent and reliable and is rapidly placing upon a paying basis a business that in other hands had been allowed to suffer from neglect and misconduct this property was secured by colonel beaupree in a deal with a western irrigation syndicate and the title to it seems to be perfect with careful management and the natural increase of land values it ought to be made the foundation for a comfortable fortune for its owner when octavia ceased reading aunt ellen uttered something as near a sniff as her breeding

m going to learn to like mutton and even concede the good qualities of centipedes at a respectful distance it s just what i need it s a new life that comes when my old one is just ending it s a release auntie it isn t a narrow ing think of the gallops over those leagues of prairies with the wind tugging at the roots of your hair the com ing close to the earth and learning over again the stories of the growing grass and the little wild flowers without names glorious is

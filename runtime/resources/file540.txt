the ostensible green of the newly painted benches a shade between the color of a pickled cucumber and that of a last year s fast black cravenette raincoat but to the city bred eye of editor westbrook the landscape appeared a masterpiece and now whether you are of those who rush in or of the gentle concourse that fears to tread you must follow in a brief invasion of the editor s mind editor westbrook s spirit was contented and serene the april number of the minerva had sold its entire edition before the tenth day of the month a newsdealer in keokuk had written that he could have sold fifty copies more if he had em the owners of the magazine had raised his the editor s salary he had just installed in his home a jewel of a recently imported cook who was afraid of policemen and the morning papers had published in full a speech he had made at a publishers banquet also there were echoing in his mind the jubilant notes of a splendid song that his charming young wife had sung to him before he left his up town apartment that morning she was taking enthusiastic interest in her music of late practising early and diligently when he had complimented her on the improvement in her voice she had fairly hugged him for joy at his praise he felt too the benign tonic medicament of the trained nurse spring tripping softly adown the wards of the convalescent city while editor westbrook was sauntering between the rows of park benches already filling with vagrants and the guardians of lawless childhood he felt his sleeve grasped and held suspecting that he was about to be panhandled he turned a cold and unprofitable face and saw that his captor was dawe shackleford dawe dingy almost ragged the genteel scracely visible in him through the deeper lines of the shabby while the editor is pulling himself out of his surprise a flashlight biography of dawe is offered he was a fiction writer and one of westbrook s old acquaintances at one time they might have called each other old friends dawe had some money in those days and lived in a decent apartment house near westbrook s the two families often went to theatres and dinners together mrs dawe and mrs westbrook became dearest friends then one day a little tentacle of the octopus just to amuse itself ingurgitated dawe s capital and he moved to the gramercy park neighborhood where one for a few groats per week may sit upon one s trunk under eight branched chandeliers and opposite carrara marble mantels and watch the mice play upon the floor dawe thought to live by writing fiction now and then he sold a story he submitted many to westbrook the minerva printed one or two of them the rest were returned westbrook sent a careful and conscientious personal letter with each rejected manuscript pointing out in detail his reasons for considering it unavailable editor westbrook had his own clear conception of what constituted good fiction so had dawe mrs dawe was mainly concerned about the constituents of the scanty dishes of food that she managed to scrape together one day dawe had been spouting to her about the excellencies of certain french writers at dinner they sat down to a dish that a hungry schoolboy could have encompassed at a gulp dawe commented it s maupassant hash said mrs dawe it may not be art but i do wish you would do a five course marion crawford serial with an ella wheeler wilcox sonnet for dessert i m hungry as far as this from success was shackleford dawe when he plucked editor westbrook s sleeve in madison square that was the first time the editor had seen dawe in several months why shack is this you said westbrook somewhat awkwardly for the form of his phrase seemed to touch upon the other s changed appearance sit down for a minute said dawe tugging at his sleeve this is my office i can t come to yours looking as i do oh sit down you won t be disgraced those half plucked birds on the other benches will take you for a swell porch climber they won t know you are only an editor smoke shack said editor westbrook sinking cautiously upon the virulent green bench he always yielded gracefully when he did yield dawe snapped at the cigar as a kingfisher darts at a sunperch or a girl pecks at a chocolate cream i have just began the editor oh i know don t finish said dawe give me a match you have just ten minutes to spare how did you manage to get past my office boy and invade my sanctum there he goes now throwing his club at a dog that couldn t read the keep off the grass signs how goes the writing asked the editor look at me said dawe for your answer now don t put on that embarrassed friendly but honest look and ask me why i don t get a job as a wine agent or a cab driver i m in the fight to a finish i know i can write good fiction and i ll force you fellows to admit it yet i ll make you change the spelling of regrets to c h e q u e before i m done with you editor westbrook gazed through his nose glasses with a sweetly sorrowful omniscient sympathetic skeptical expression the copyrighted expression of the editor beleagured by the unavailable contributor have you read the last story i sent you the alarum of the soul asked dawe carefully i hesitated over that

was a dreary hostelry in great disuse both by strangers and friends it stood at a corner of the street of the holy sepulchre a grove of small orange trees crowded against one side of it enclosed by a low rock wall over which a tall man might easily step the house was of plastered adobe stained a hundred shades of color by the salt breeze and the sun upon its upper balcony opened a central door and two windows containing broad jalousies instead of sashes the lower floor communicated by two doorways with the narrow rock paved sidewalk the pulperia or drinking shop of the proprietess madama timotea ortiz occupied the ground floor on the bottles of brandy anisada scotch smoke and inexpensive wines behind the little counter the dust lay thick save where the fingers of infrequent customers had left irregular prints the upper story contained four or five guest rooms which were rarely put to their destined use sometimes a fruitgrower riding in from his plantation to confer with his agent would pass a melancholy night in the dismal upper story sometimes a minor native official on some trifling government quest would have his pomp and majesty awed by madama s sepulchral hospitality but madama sat behind her bar content not desiring to quarrel with fate if any one required meat drink or lodging at the hotel de los extranjeros they had but to come and be served esta bueno if they came not why then they came not esta bueno as the exceptional yachtsman was making his way down the precarious sidewalk of the street of the holy sepulchre the solitary permanent guest of that decaying hotel sat at its door enjoying the breeze from the sea doctor gregg the quarantine physician was a man of fifty or sixty with a florid face and the longest beard between topeka and terra del fuego he held his position by virtue of an appointment by the board of health of a seaport city in one of the southern states that city feared the ancient enemy of every southern seaport the yellow fever and it was the duty of doctor gregg to examine crew and passengers of every vessel leaving coralio for preliminary symptoms the duties were light and the salary for one who lived in coralio ample surplus time there was in plenty and the good doctor added to his gains by a large private practice among the residents of the coast the fact that he did not know ten words of spanish was no obstacle a pulse could be felt and a fee collected without one being a linguist add to the description the facts that the doctor had a story to tell concerning the operation of trepanning which no listener had ever allowed him to conclude and that he believed in brandy as a prophylactic and the special points of interest possessed by doctor gregg will have become exhausted the doctor had dragged a chair to the sidewalk he was coatless and he leaned back against the wall and smoked while he stroked his beard surprise came into his pale blue eyes when he caught sight of smith in his unusual and prismatic clothes you re doctor gregg is that right said smith feeling the dog s head pin in his tie the constable i mean the consul told me you hung out at this caravansary my name s smith and i came in a yacht taking a cruise around looking at the monkeys and pineapple trees come inside and have a drink doc this cafe looks on the blink but i guess it can set out something wet i will join you sir in just a taste of brandy said doctor gregg rising quickly i find that as a prophylactic a little brandy is almost a necessity in this climate as they turned to enter the pulperia a native man barefoot glided noiselessly up and addressed the doctor in spanish he was yellowish brown like an over ripe lemon he wore a cotton shirt and ragged linen trousers girded by a leather belt his face was like an animal s live and wary but without promise of much intelligence this man jabbered with animation and so much seriousness that it seemed a pity that his words were to be wasted doctor gregg felt his pulse you sick he inquired mi mujer es enferma en la casa said the man thus endeavoring to convey the news in the only language open to him that his wife lay ill in her palm thatched hut the doctor drew a handful of capsules filled with a white powder from his trousers pocket he counted out ten of them into the native s hand and held up his forefinger impressively take one said the doctor every two hours he then held up two fingers shaking them emphatically before the native s face next he pulled out his watch and ran his finger round the dial twice again the two fingers confronted the patient s nose two two two hours repeated the doctor si senor said the native sadly he pulled a cheap silver watch from his own pocket and laid it in the doctor s hand me bring said he struggling painfully with his scant english other watchy tomorrow then he departed downheartedly with his capsules a very ignorant race of people sir said the doctor as he slipped the watch into his pocket he seems to have mistaken my directions for taking the physic for the fee however it is all right he owes me an account anyway the chances are that he won t bring the other watch you can t depend on anything they promise you about that drink now how did you come to coralio mr smith i was not aware that any boats except the karlesfin had arrived for some days the two leaned against the deserted bar and madama set out a bottle without

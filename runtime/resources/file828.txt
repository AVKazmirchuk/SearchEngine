why they were there he had half promised to render a decision that day upon their location the chief clerk now brought in a batch of duplicate certificates for the commissioner to sign as he traced his sprawling signature hollis summerfield comr genl land office on each one the chief clerk stood deftly removing them and applying the blotter i notice said the chief clerk you ve been going through that salado county location kampfer is mak ing a new map of salado and i believe is platting in that section of the county now i will see it said the comissioner a few moments later he went to the draughtsmen s room as he entered he saw five or six of the draughtsmen grouped about kampfer s desk gargling away at each other in pectoral german and gazing at something there upon at the commissioner s approach they scattered to their several places kampfer a wizened little ger man with long frizzled ringlets and a watery eye began to stammer forth some sort of an apology the commis sioner thought for the congregation of his fellows about his desk never mind said the commissioner i wish to see the map you are making and passing around the old german seated himself upon the high draughtsman s stool kampfer continued to break english in trving to explain herr gommissioner i assure you blenty sat i haf not it bremeditated sat it wass sat it itself make look you from se field notes wass it blatted blease to observe se calls south degrees west varas south degrees east varas south south west south degrees west and so on herr gommissioner nefer would i have the commissioner raised one white hand silently kampfer dropped his pipe and fled with a hand at each side of his face and his elbows resting upon the desk the commissioner sat staring at the map which was spread and fastened there staring at the sweet and living profile of little georgia drawn thereupon at her face pensive delicate and infantile outlined in a perfect likeness when his mind at length came to inquire into the rea son of it he saw that it must have been as kampfer had said unpremeditated the old draughtsman had been platting in the elias denny survey and georgia s likeness striking though it was was formed by nothing more than the meanders of chiquito river indeed kampfer s blotter whereon his preliminary work was done showed the laborious tracings of the calls and the countless pricks of the compasses then over his faint pencilling kampfer had drawn in india ink with a full firm pen the similitude of chiquito river and forth had blossomed mysteriously the dainty pathetic profile of the child the commissioner sat for half an hour with his face in his hands gazing downward and none dared approach him then he arose and walked out in the business office he paused long enough to ask that the denny file be brought to his desk he found hamlin and avery still reclining in their chairs apparently oblivious of business they were lazily discussing summer opera it being their habit perhaps their pride also to appear supernaturally indifferent whenever they stood with large interests imperilled and they stood to win more on this stake than most people knew they possessed inside infor mation to the effect that a new railroad would within a year split this very chiquito river valley and send land values ballooning all along its route a dollar under thirty thousand profit on this location if it should hold good would be a loss to their expectations so while they chatted lightly and waited for the commissioner to open the subject there was a quick sidelong sparkle in their eyes evincing a desire to read their title clear to those fair acres on the chiquito a clerk brought in the file the commissioner seated himself and wrote upon it in red ink then he rose to his feet and stood for a while looking straight out of the window the land office capped the summit of a bold hill the eyes of the commissioner passed over the roofs of many houses set in a packing of deep green the whole checkered by strips of blinding white streets the horizon where his gaze was focussed swelled to a fair wooded eminence flecked with faint dots of shining white there was the cemetery where lay many who were forgot ten and a few who had not lived in vain and one lay there occupying very small space whose childish heart had been large enough to desire while near its last beats good to others the commissioner s lips moved slightly as he whispered to himself it was her last will and testament and i have neglected it so long the big brown cigars of hamlin and avery were fireless but they still gripped them between their teeth and waited while they marvelled at the absent expression upon the commissioner s face by and by he spoke suddenly and promptly gentlemen i have just indorsed the elias denny survey for patenting this office will not regard your location upon a part of it as legal he paused a moment and then extending his hand as those dear old time ones used to do in debate he enunciated the spirit of that ruling that subsequently drove the land sharks to the wall and placed the seal of peace and security over the doors of ten thousand homes and furthermore he continued with a clear soft light upon his face it may interest you to know that from this time on this office will consider that when a survey of land made by virtue of a certificate granted by this state to the men who wrested it from the wilderness and the savage made in good faith settled in good faith and left in good faith to their children or innocent

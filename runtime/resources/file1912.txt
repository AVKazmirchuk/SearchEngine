awakened beast rang for a block around if that s your dog said jim when they were on the street again what s to hinder you from running that habeas corpus you ve got around his neck over a limb and

so you can turn around and leave by the kitchen and he snores and barks in his sleep and i have to smoke in the park on account of his asthma don t missis telfair began jim oh shut up said the dogman what is it this time whiskey said jim make it two said the dogman well i ll be racking along down toward the ferry said the other come on there you mangy turtle backed snake headed bench legged ton

you think of that does missis telfair began jim oh drop it said the dogman come again whiskey said jim make it two said the dogman they walked on to the ferry the ranchman stepped to the ticket window suddenly the swift landing of three or four heavy kicks was heard the air was rent by piercing canine shrieks and a pained outraged lubberly bow legged pudding of a dog ran frenziedly up the street alone ticket to denver said jim make it two shouted the ex dogman reaching for his inside pocket the champion of the weather if you should speak of the kiowa reservation to the average new yorker he probably wouldn t know whether you were referring to a new political dodge at albany or a leitmotif from parsifal but out in the kiowa reservation advices have been received concerning the existence of new york a party of us were on a hunting trip in the reservation bud kingsbury our guide philosopher and friend was broiling antelope steaks in camp one night one of the party a pinkish haired young man in a correct hunting costume sauntered over to the fire to light a cigarette and remarked carelessly to bud nice night why yes said bud as nice as any night could be that ain t received the broadway stamp of approval now the young man was from new york but the rest of us wondered how bud guessed it so when the steaks were done we besought him to lay bare his system of ratiocination and as bud was something of a territorial talking machine he made oration as follows how did i know he was from new york well i figured it out as soon as he sprung them two words on me i was in new york myself a couple of years ago and i noticed some of the earmarks and hoof tracks of the rancho manhattan found new york rather different from the panhandle didn t you bud asked one of the hunters can t say that i did answered bud anyways not more than some the main trail in that town which they call broadway is plenty travelled but they re about the same brand of bipeds that tramp around in cheyenne and amarillo at first i was sort of rattled by the crowds but i soon says to myself here now bud they re just plain folks like you and geronimo and grover cleveland and the watson boys so don t get all flustered up with consternation under your saddle blanket and then i feels calm and peaceful like i was back in the nation again at a ghost dance or a green corn pow wow i d been saving up for a year to give this new york a whirl i knew a man named summers that lived there but i couldn t find him so i played a lone hand at enjoying the intoxicating pleasures of the corn fed metropolis for a while i was so frivolous and locoed by the electric lights and the noises of the phonographs and the second story railroads that i forgot one of the crying needs of my western system of natural requirements i never was no hand to deny myself the pleasures of sociable vocal intercourse with friends and strangers out in the territories when i meet a man i never saw before inside of nine minutes i know his income religion size of collar and his wife s temper and how much he pays for clothes al imony and chewing tobacco it s a gift with me not to be penurious with my conversation but this here new york was inaugurated on the idea of abstemiousness in regard to the parts of speech at the end of three weeks nobody in the city had fired even a blank syllable in my direction except the waiter in the grub emporium where i fed and as his outpourings of syntax wasn t nothing but plagiarisms from the bill of fare he never satisfied my yearnings which was to have somebody hit if i stood next to a man at a bar he d edge off and give a baldwin ziegler look as if he suspected me of having the north pole concealed on my person i began to wish that i d gone to abilene or waco for my paseado for the mayor of them places will drink with you and the first citizen you meet will tell you his middle name and ask you to take a chance in a raffle for a music box well one day when i was particular hankering for to be gregarious with something more loquacious than a lamp post a fellow in a caffy says to me says he nice day he was a kind of a manager of the place and i reckon he d seen me in there a good many times he had a face like a fish and an eye like judas but i got up and put one arm around his neck pardner i says sure it s a nice day you re the first gentleman in all new york to observe that the intricacies of human speech might not be altogether wasted on william kingsbury but don t you think says i that twas a little cool early in the morning and ain t there a feeling of rain in the air to night but along about noon it sure was gallupsious weather how s all up to the house you doing right well with the caffy now well sir that galoot just turns his back and walks off stiff without a word after all my trying to be agreeable i didn t know what to make of it that night i finds a note from summers who d been away from town giving the address of his camp i goes up to his house and has a good old time talk with his folks and i tells summers about the actions of this coyote in the caffy and desires interpretation oh says summers he wasn t intending to strike up a conversation with you that s just the new york style he d seen you was a regular customer and he spoke a word or two just to show you he appreciated your custom you oughtn t to have followed it up that s about as far as we care to go with a stranger a word or so about the weather may be ventured but we don t generally make it the basis of an acquaintance billy says i the weather and its ramifications is a solemn subject with me meteorology is one of my sore points no man can open up the question of temperature or humidity or the glad sunshine with me and then turn tail on it without its leading to a falling barometer i m going down to see that man again and give him a lesson in the art of continuous conversation you say new york etiquette allows him two words and no answer well he s going to turn himself into a weather bureau and finish what he begun with me besides indulging in neighbourly remarks on other subjects summers talked agin it but i was irritated some and i went on the street car back to that caffy the same fellow was there yet walking round in a sort of back corral where there was tables and chairs a few people was sitting around having drinks and sneering at one another i called that man to one side and herded him into a corner i unbuttoned enough to show him a thirty eight i carried stuck under my vest pardner i says a brief space ago i was in here and you seized the opportunity to say it was a nice day when i attempted to corroborate your weather signal you turned your back and walked off now says i you frog hearted language shy stiff necked cross between a spitzbergen sea cook and a muzzled oyster you resume where you left off in your discourse on the weather the fellow looks at me and tries to grin but he sees i don t and he comes around serious well says he eyeing the handle of my gun it was rather a nice day some warmish though particulars you mealy mouthed snoozer i says let s have the specifications expatiate fill in the outlines when you start anything with me in short hand it s bound to turn out a storm signal looked like rain yesterday says the man but it cleared off fine in the forenoon i hear the farmers are needing rain right badly up state that s the kind of a canter says i shake the new york dust off your hoofs and be a real agreeable kind of a centaur you broke the ice you know and we re getting better acquainted every minute seems to me i asked you about your family they re all well thanks says he we we have a new piano now you re coming it i says this cold reserve is breaking up at last that little touch about the piano almost makes us brothers what s the youngest kid s name i asks him thomas says he he s just getting well from the measles i feel like i d known you always says i now there was just one more are you doing right well with the caffy now pretty well he says i m putting away a little money glad to hear it says i now go back to your work and get civilized keep your hands off the weather unless you re ready to follow it up in a personal manner it s a subject that naturally belongs to sociability and the forming of new ties and i hate to see it handed out in small change in a town like this so the next day i rolls up my blankets and hits the trail away from new york city for many minutes after bud ceased talking we lingered around the fire and then all hands began to disperse for bed as i was unrolling my bedding i heard the pinkish haired young man saying to bud with something like anxiety in his voice as i say mr kingsbury there is something really beautiful about this night the delightful breeze and the bright stars and the clear air unite in making it wonderfully attractive yes said bud it s a nice night makes the whole world kin the burglar stepped inside the window quickly and then he took his time a burglar who respects his art always takes his time before taking anything else the house was a private residence by its boarded front door and untrimmed boston ivy the burglar knew that the mistress of it was sitting on some oceanside piazza telling a sympathetic man in a yachting cap that no one had ever understood her sensitive lonely heart he knew by the light in the third story front windows and by the lateness of the season that the master of the house had come home and would soon extinguish his light and retire for it was september of the year and of the soul in which season the house s good man comes to consider roof gardens and stenographers as vanities and to desire the return of his mate and the more durable blessings of decorum and the moral excellencies the burglar lighted a cigarette the guarded glow of the match illuminated his salient points for a moment he belonged to the third type of burglars this third type has not yet been recognized and accepted the police have made us familiar with the first and second their classification is simple the collar is the distinguishing mark when a burglar is caught who does not wear a collar he is described as a degenerate of the lowest type singularly vicious and depraved and is suspected of being the desperate criminal who stole the handcuffs out of patrolman hennessy s pocket in and walked away to escape arrest the other well known type is the burglar who wears a collar he is always referred to as a raffles in real life he is invariably a gentleman by daylight breakfasting in a dress suit and posing as a paperhanger while after dark he plies his nefarious occupation of burglary his mother is an extremely wealthy and respected resident of ocean grove and when he is conducted to his cell he asks at once for a nail file and the police gazette he always has a wife in every state in the union and fiancees in all the territories and the newspapers print his matrimonial gallery out of their stock of cuts of the ladies who were cured by only one bottle after having been given up by five doctors experiencing great relief after the first dose the burglar wore a blue sweater he was neither a raffles nor one of the chefs from hell s kitchen the police would have been baffled had they attempted to classify him they have not yet heard of the respectable unassuming burglar who is neither above nor below his station this burglar of the third class began to prowl he wore no masks dark lanterns or gum shoes he carried a calibre revolver in his pocket and he chewed peppermint gum thoughtfully the furniture of the house was swathed in its summer dust protectors the silver was far away in safe deposit vaults the burglar expected no remarkable haul his objective point was that dimly lighted room where the master of the house should be sleeping heavily after whatever solace he had sought to lighten the burden of his loneliness a touch might be made there to the extent of legitimate fair professional profits loose money a watch a jewelled stick pin nothing exorbitant or beyond rea son he had seen the window left open and had taken the chance the burglar softly opened the door of the lighted room the gas was turned low a man lay in the bed asleep on the dresser lay many things in confusion a crumpled roll of bills a watch keys three poker chips crushed cigars a pink silk hair bow and an unopened bottle of bromo seltzer for a bulwark in the morning the burglar took three steps toward the dresser the man in the bed suddenly uttered a squeaky groan and opened his eyes his right hand slid under his pillow but remained there lay still said the burglar in conversational tone burglars of the third type do not hiss the citizen in the bed looked at the round end of the burglar s pistol and lay still now hold up both your hands commanded the burglar the citizen had a little pointed brown and gray beard like that of a painless dentist he looked solid esteemed irritable and disgusted he sat up in bed and raised his right hand above his head up with the other one ordered the burglar you might be amphibious and shoot with your left you can count two can t you hurry up now can t raise the other one said the citizen with a contortion of his lineaments what s the matter with it rheumatism in the shoulder inflammatory was the inflammation has gone down the burglar stood for a moment or two holding his gun on the afflicted one he glanced at the plunder on the dresser and then with a half embarrassed air back at the man in the bed then he too made a sudden grimace don t stand there making faces snapped the citizen bad humouredly if you ve come to burgle why don t you do it there s some stuff lying around scuse me said the burglar with a grin but it just socked me one too it s good for you that rheumatism and me happens to be old pals i got it in my left arm too most anybody but me would have popped you when you wouldn t hoist that left claw of yours how long have you had it inquired the citizen four years i guess that ain t all once you ve got it it s you for a rheumatic life that s my judgment ever try rattlesnake oil asked the citizen interestedly gallons said the burglar if all the snakes i ve used the oil of was strung out in a row they d reach eight times as far as saturn and the rattles could be heard at valparaiso indiana and back some use chiselum s pills remarked the citizen fudge said the burglar took em five months no good i had some relief the year i tried finkelham s extract balm of gilead poultices and potts s pain pulverizer but i think it was the buckeye i carried in my pocket what done the trick is yours worse in the morning or at night asked the citizen night said the burglar just when i m busiest say take down that arm of yours i guess you won t say did you ever try blickerstaff s blood builder i never did does yours come in paroxysms or is it a steady pain the burglar sat down on the foot of the bed and rested his gun on his crossed knee it jumps said he it strikes me when i ain t looking for it i had to give up second story work because i got stuck sometimes half way up tell you what i don t believe the bloomin doctors know what is good for it same here i ve spent a thousand dollars without getting any relief yours swell any of mornings and when it s goin to rain great christopher me too said the citizen i can tell when a streak of humidity the size of a table cloth starts from florida on its way to new york and if i pass a theatre where there s an east lynne matinee going on the moisture starts my left arm jumping like a toothache it s undiluted hades said the burglar you re dead right said the citizen the burglar looked down at his pistol and thrust it into his pocket with an awkward attempt at ease say old man he said constrainedly ever try opodeldoc slop said the citizen angrily might as well rub on restaurant butter sure concurred the burglar it s a salve suitable for little minnie when the kitty scratches her finger i ll tell you what we re up against it i only find one thing that eases her up hey little old sanitary ameliorating lest we forget booze say this job s off scuse me get on your clothes and let s go out and have some scuse the liberty but ouch there she goes again for a week said the citizen i haven t been able to dress myself without help i m afraid thomas is in bed and climb out said the burglar i ll help you get into your duds the conventional returned as a tidal wave and flooded the citizen he stroked his brown and gray beard it s very unusual he began here s your shirt said the burglar fall out i knew a man who said omberry s ointment fixed him in two weeks so he could use both hands in tying his four in hand as they were going out the door the citizen turned and started back liked to forgot my money he explained laid it on the dresser last night the burglar caught him by the right sleeve come on he said bluffly i ask you leave it alone i ve got the price ever try witch hazel and oil of wintergreen at arms with morpheus i never could quite understand how tom hopkins came to make that blunder for he had been through a whole term at a medical college before he inherited his aunt s fortune and had been considered strong in therapeutics we had been making a call together that evening and afterward tom ran up to my rooms for a pipe and a chat before going on to his own luxurious apartments i had stepped into the other room for a moment when i heard tom sing out oh billy i m going to take about four grains of quinine if you don t mind i m feeling all blue and shivery guess i m taking cold all right i called back the bottle is on the second shelf take it in a spoonful of that elixir of eucalyptus it knocks the bitter out after i came back we sat by the fire and got our briars going in about eight minutes tom sank back into a gentle collapse i went straight to the medicine cabinet and looked you unmitigated hayseed i growled see what money will do for a man s brains there stood the morphine bottle with the stopple out just as tom had left it i routed out another young m d who roomed on the floor above and sent him for old doctor gales two squares away tom hopkins has too much money to be attended by rising young practitioners alone when gales came we put tom through as expensive a course of treatment as the resources of the profession permit after the more drastic remedies we gave him citrate of caffeine in frequent doses and strong coffee and walked him up and down the floor between two of us old gales pinched him and slapped his face and worked hard for the big check he could see in the distance the young m d from the next floor gave tom a most hearty rousing kick and then apologized to me couldn t help it he said i never kicked a millionaire before in my life i may never have another opportunity now said doctor gales after a couple of hours he ll do but keep him awake for another hour you can do that by talking to him and shaking him up occasionally when his pulse and respiration are normal then let him sleep i ll leave him with you now i was left alone with tom whom we had laid on a couch he lay very still and his eyes were half closed i began my work of keeping him awake well old man i said you ve had a narrow squeak but we ve pulled you through when you were attending lectures tom didn t any of the professors ever casually remark that m o r p h i a never spells quinia especially in four grain doses but i won t pile it up on you until you get on your feet but you ought to have been a druggist tom you re splendidly qualified to fill prescriptions tom looked at me with a faint and foolish smile b ly he murmured i feel jus like a hum n bird flyin around a jolly lot of most shpensive roses don bozzer me goin sleep now and he went to sleep in two seconds i shook him by the shoulder now tom i said severely this won t do the big doctor said you must stay awake for at least an hour open your eyes you re not entirely safe yet you know wake up tom hopkins weighs one hundred and ninety eight he gave me another somnolent grin and fell into deeper slumber i would have made him move about but i might as well have tried to make cleopatra s needle waltz around the room with me tom s breathing became stertorous and that in connection with morphia poisoning means danger then i began to think i could not rouse his body i must strive to excite his mind make him angry was an idea that suggested itself good i thought but how there was not a joint in tom s armour dear old fellow he was good nature itself and a gallant gentleman fine and true and clean as sunlight he came from somewhere down south where they still have ideals and a code new york had charmed but had not spoiled him he had that old fashioned chivalrous reverence for women that eur eka there was my idea i worked the thing up for a minute or two in my imagination i chuckled to myself at the thought of springing a thing like that on old tom hopkins then i took him by the shoulder and shook him till his ears flopped he opened his eyes lazily i assumed an expression of scorn and contempt and pointed my finger within two inches of his nose listen to me hopkins i said in cutting and distinct tones you and i have been good friends but i want you to understand that in the future my doors are closed against any man who acts as much like a scoundrel as you have tom looked the least bit interested what s the matter billy he muttered composedly don t your clothes fit you if i were in your place i went on which thank god i am not i think i would be afraid to close my eyes how about that girl you left waiting for you down among those lonesome southern pines the girl that you ve forgotten since you came into your confounded money oh i know what i m talking about while you were a poor medical student she was good enough for you but now since you are a millionaire it s different i wonder what she thinks of the performances of that peculiar class of people which she has been taught to worship the southern gentlemen i m sorry hopkins that i was forced to speak about these matters but you ve covered it up so well and played your part so nicely that i would have sworn you were above such unmanly tricks poor tom i could scarcely keep from laughing outright to see him struggling against the effects of the opiate he was distinctly angry and i didn t blame him tom had a southern temper his eyes were open now and they showed a gleam or two of fire but the drug still clouded his mind and bound his tongue c c confound you he stammered i ll s smash you he tried to rise from the couch with all his size he was very weak now i thrust him back with one arm he lay there glaring like a lion in a trap that will hold you for a while you old loony i said to myself i got up and lit my pipe for i was needing a smoke i walked around a bit congratulating myself on my brilliant idea i heard a snore i looked around tom was asleep again i walked over and punched him on the jaw he looked at me as pleasant and ungrudging as an idiot i chewed my pipe and gave it to him hard i want you to recover yourself and get out of my rooms as soon as you can i said insultingly i ve told you what i think of you if you have any honour or honesty left you will think twice before you attempt again to associate with gentlemen she s a poor girl isn t she i sneered somewhat too plain and unfashionable for us since we got our money be ashamed to walk on fifth avenue with her wouldn t you hopkins you re forty seven times worse than a cad who cares for your money i don t i ll bet that girl don t perhaps if you didn t have it you d be more of a man as it is you ve made a cur of yourself and i thought that quite dramatic perhaps broken a faithful heart old tom hopkins breaking a faithful heart let me be rid of you as soon as possible i turned my back on tom and winked at myself in a mirror i heard him moving and i turned again quickly i didn t want a hundred and ninety eight pounds falling on me from the rear but tom had only turned partly over and laid one arm across his face he spoke a few words rather more distinctly than before i couldn t have talked this way to you billy even if i d heard people lyin bout you but jus soon s i can s stand up i ll break your neck don f get it i did feel a little ashamed then but it was to save tom in the morning when i explained it we would have a good laugh over it together in about twenty minutes tom dropped into a sound easy slumber i felt his pulse listened to his respiration and let him sleep everything was normal and tom was safe i went into the other room and tumbled into bed i found tom up and dressed when i awoke the next morning he was entirely himself again with the exception of shaky nerves and a tongue like a white oak chip what an idiot i was he said thoughtfully i remember thinking that quinine bottle looked queer while i was taking the dose have much trouble in bringing me round i told him no his memory seemed bad about the entire affair i concluded that he had no recollection of my efforts to keep him awake and decided not to enlighten him some other time i thought when he was feeling better we would have some fun over it when tom was ready to go he stopped with the door open and shook my hand much obliged old fellow he said quietly for taking so much trouble with me and for what you said i m going down now to telegraph to the little girl a ghost of a chance actually a hod repeated mrs kinsolving pathetically mrs bellamy bellmore arched a sympathetic eyebrow thus she expressed condolence and a generous amount of apparent surprise fancy her telling everywhere recapitulated mrs kinsolving that she saw a ghost in the apartment she occupied here our choicest guest room a ghost carrying a hod on its shoulder the ghost of an old man in overalls smoking a pipe and carrying a hod the very absurdity of the thing shows her malicious intent there never was a kinsolving that carried a hod every one knows that mr kinsolving s father accumulated his money by large building contracts but he never worked a day with his own hands he had this house built from his own plans but oh a hod why need she have been so cruel and malicious it is really too bad murmured mrs bellmore with an approving glance of her fine eyes about the vast chamber done in lilac and old gold and it was in this room she saw it oh no i m not afraid of ghosts don t have the least fear on my account i m glad you put me in here i think family ghosts so interesting but really the story does sound a little inconsistent i should have expected something better from mrs fischer suympkins don t they carry bricks in hods why should a ghost bring bricks into a villa built of marble and stone i m so sorry but it makes me think that age is beginning to tell upon mrs fischer suympkins this house continued mrs kinsolving was built upon the site of an old one used by the family during the revolution there wouldn t be anything strange in its having a ghost and there was a captain kinsolving who fought in general greene s army though we ve never been able to secure any papers to vouch for it if there is to be a family ghost why couldn t it have been his instead of a bricklayer s the ghost of a revolutionary ancestor wouldn t be a bad idea agreed mrs bellmore but you know how arbitrary and inconsiderate ghosts can be maybe like love they are engendered in the eye one advantage of those who see ghosts is that their stories can t be disproved by a spiteful eye a revolutionary knapsack might easily be construed to be a hod dear mrs kinsolving think no more of it i am sure it was a knapsack but she told everybody mourned mrs kinsolving inconsolable she insisted upon the details there is the pipe and how are you going to get out of the overalls shan t get into them said mrs bellmore with a prettily suppressed yawn too stiff and wrinkly is that you felice prepare my bath please do you dine at seven at clifftop mrs kinsolving so kind of you to run in for a chat before dinner i love those little touches of informality with a guest they give such a home flavour to a visit so sorry i must be dressing i am so indolent i always postpone it until the last moment mrs fischer suympkins had been the first large plum that the kinsolvings had drawn from the social pie for a long time the pie itself had been out of reach on a top shelf but the purse and the pursuit had at last lowered it mrs fischer suympkins was the heliograph of the smart society parading corps the glitter of her wit and actions passed along the line transmitting whatever was latest and most daring in the game of peep show formerly her fame and leadership had been secure enough not to need the support of such artifices as handing around live frogs for favours at a cotillon but now these things were necessary to the holding of her throne beside middle age had come to preside incongruous at her capers the sensational papers had cut her space from a page to two columns her wit developed a sting her manners became more rough and inconsiderate as if she felt the royal necessity of establishing her autocracy by scorning the conventionalities that bound lesser potentates to some pressure at the command of the kinsolvings she had yielded so far as to honour their house by her presence for an evening and night she had her revenge upon her hostess by relating with grim enjoyment and sarcastic humour her story of the vision carrying the hod to that lady in raptures at having penetrated thus far toward the coveted inner circle the result came as a crushing disappointment everybody either sympathized or laughed and there was little to choose between the two modes of expression but later on mrs kinsolving s hopes and spirits were revived by the capture of a second and greater prize mrs bellamy bellmore had accepted an invitation to visit at clifftop and would remain for three days mrs bellmore was one of the younger matrons whose beauty descent and wealth gave her a reserved seat in the holy of holies that required no strenuous bolstering she was generous enough thus to give mrs kinsolving the accolade that was so poignantly desired and at the same time she thought how much it would please terence perhaps it would end by solving him terence was mrs kinsolving s son aged twenty nine quite good looking enough and with two or three attractive and mysterious traits for one he was very devoted to his mother and that was sufficiently odd to deserve notice for others he talked so little that it was irritating and he seemed either very shy or very deep terence interested mrs bellmore because she was not sure which it was she intended to study him a little longer unless she forgot the matter if he was only shy she would abandon him for shyness is a bore if he was deep she would also abandon him for depth is precarious on the afternoon of the third day of her visit terence hunted up mrs bellmore and found her in a nook actually looking at an album it s so good of you said he to come down here and retrieve the day for us i suppose you have heard that mrs fischer suympkins scuttled the ship before she left she knocked a whole plank out of the bottom with a hod my mother is grieving herself ill about it can t you manage to see a ghost for us while you are here mrs bellmore a bang up swell ghost with a coronet on his head and a cheque book under his arm that was a naughty old lady terence said mrs bellmore to tell such stories perhaps you gave her too much supper your mother doesn t really take it seriously does she i think she does answered terence one would think every brick in the hod had dropped on her it s a good mammy and i don t like to see her worried it s to be hoped that the ghost belongs to the hod carriers union and will go out on a strike if he doesn t there will be no peace in this family i m sleeping in the ghost chamber said mrs bellmore pensively but it s so nice i wouldn t change it even if i were afraid which i m not it wouldn t do for me to submit a counter story of a desirable aristocratic shade would it i would do so with pleasure but it seems to me it would be too obviously an antidote for the other narrative to be effective true said terence running two fingers thoughtfully into his crisp brown hair that would never do how would it work to see the same ghost again minus the overalls and have gold bricks in the hod that would elevate the spectre from degrading toil to a financial plane don t you think that would be respectable enough there was an ancestor who fought against the britishers wasn t there your mother said something to that effect i believe so one of those old chaps in raglan vests and golf trousers i don t care a continental for a continental myself but the mother has set her heart on pomp and heraldry and pyrotechnics and i want her to be happy you are a good boy terence said mrs bellmore sweeping her silks close to one side of her not to beat your mother sit here by me and let s look at the album just as people used to do twenty years ago now tell me about every one of them who is this tall dignified gentleman leaning against the horizon with one arm on the corinthian column that old chap with the big feet inquired terence craning his neck that s great uncle o brannigan he used to keep a rathskeller on the bowery i asked you to sit down terence if you are not going to amuse or obey me i shall report in the morning that i saw a ghost wearing an apron and carrying schooners of beer now that is better to be shy at your age terence is a thing that you should blush to acknowledge at breakfast on the last morning of her visit mrs bellmore startled and entranced every one present by announcing positively that she had seen the ghost did it have a a a mrs kinsolving in her suspense and agitation could not bring out the word no indeed far from it there was a chorus of questions from others at the table were n t you frightened what did it do how did it look how was it dressed did it say anything didn t you scream i ll try to answer everything at once said mrs bellmore heroically although i m frightfully hungry something awakened me i m not sure whether it was a noise or a touch and there stood the phantom i never burn a light at night so the room was quite dark but i saw it plainly i wasn t dreaming it was a tall man all misty white from head to foot it wore the full dress of the old colonial days powdered hair baggy coat skirts lace ruffles and a sword it looked intangible and luminous in the dark and moved without a sound yes i was a little frightened at first or startled i should say it was the first ghost i had ever seen no it didn t say anything i didn t scream i raised up on my elbow and then it glided silently away and disappeared when it reached the door mrs kinsolving was in the seventh heaven the description is that of captain kinsolving of general greene s army one of our ancestors she said in a voice that trembled with pride and relief i really think i must apologize for our ghostly relative mrs bellmore i am afraid he must have badly disturbed your rest terence sent a smile of pleased congratulation toward his mother attainment was mrs kinsolving s at last and he loved to see her happy i suppose i ought to be ashamed to confess said mrs bellmore who was now enjoying her breakfast that i wasn t very much disturbed i presume it would have been the customary thing to scream and faint and have all of you running about in picturesque costumes but after the first alarm was over i really couldn t work myself up to a panic the ghost retired from the stage quietly and peacefully after doing its little turn and i went to sleep again nearly all listened politely accepted mrs bellmore s story as a made up affair charitably offered as an offset to the unkind vision seen by mrs fischer suympkins but one or two present perceived that her assertions bore the genuine stamp of her own convictions truth and candour seemed to attend upon every word even a scoffer at ghosts if he were very observant would have been forced to admit that she had at least in a very vivid dream been honestly aware of the weird visitor soon mrs bellmore s maid was packing in two hours the auto would come to convey her to the station as terence was strolling upon the east piazza mrs bellmore came up to him with a confidential sparkle in her eye i didn t wish to tell the others all of it she said but i will tell you in a way i think you should be held responsible can you guess in what manner that ghost awakened me last night rattled chains suggested terence after some thought or groaned they usually do one or the other do you happen to know continued mrs bellmore with sudden irrelevancy if i resemble any one of the female relatives of your restless ancestor captain kinsolving don t think so said terence with an extremely puzzled air never heard of any of them being noted beauties then why said mrs bellmore looking the young man gravely in the eye should that ghost have kissed me as i m sure it did heavens exclaimed terence in wide eyed amazement you don t mean that mrs bellmore did he actually kiss you i said it corrected mrs bellmore i hope the impersonal pronoun is correctly used but why did you say i was responsible because you are the only living male relative of the ghost i see unto the third and fourth generation but seriously did he did it how do you know how does any one know i was asleep and that is what awakened me i m almost certain almost well i awoke just as oh can t you understand what i mean when anything arouses you suddenly you are not positive whether you dreamed or and yet you know that dear me terence must i dissect the most elementary sensations in order to accommodate your extremely practical intelligence but about kissing ghosts you know said terence humbly i require the most primary instruction i never kissed a ghost is it is it the sensation said mrs bellmore with deliberate but slightly smiling emphasis since you are seeking instruction is a mingling of the material and the spiritual of course said terence suddenly growing serious it was a dream or some kind of an hallucination nobody believes in spirits these days if you told the tale out of kindness of heart mrs bellmore i can t express how grateful i am to you it has made my mother supremely happy that revolutionary ancestor was a stunning idea mrs bellmore sighed the usual fate of ghost seers is mine she said resignedly my privileged encounter with a spirit is attributed to lobster salad or mendacity well i have at least one memory left from the wreck a kiss from the unseen world was captain kinsolving a very brave man do you know terence he was licked at yorktown i believe said terence reflecting they say he skedaddled with his company after the first battle there i thought he must have been timid said mrs bellmore absently he might have had another another battle asked terence dully what else could i mean i must go and get ready now the auto will be here in an hour i ve enjoyed clifftop immensely such a lovely morning isn t it terence on her way to the station mrs bellmore took from her bag a silk handkerchief and looked at it with a little peculiar smile then she tied it in several very hard knots and threw it at a convenient moment over the edge of the cliff along which the road ran in his room terence was giving some directions to his man brooks have this stuff done up in a parcel he said and ship it to the address on that card the card was that of a new york costumer the stuff was a gentleman s costume of the days of made of white satin with silver buckles white silk stockings and white kid shoes a powdered wig and a sword completed the dress and look about brooks added terence a little anxiously for a silk handkerchief with my initials in one corner i must have dropped it somewhere it was a month later when mrs bellmore and one or two others of the smart crowd were making up a list of names for a coaching trip through the catskills mrs bellmore looked over the list for a final censoring the name of terence kinsolving was there mrs bellmore ran her prohibitive pencil lightly through the name too shy she murmured sweetly in explanation jimmy hayes and muriel i supper was over and there had fallen upon the camp the silence that accompanies the rolling of corn husk cigarettes the water hole shone from the dark earth like a patch of fallen sky coyotes yelped dull thumps indicated the rocking horse movements of the hobbled ponies as they moved to fresh grass a half troop of the frontier battalion of texas rangers were distributed about the fire a well known sound the fluttering and scraping of chaparral against wooden stirrups came from the thick brush above the camp the rangers listened cautiously they heard a loud and cheerful voice call out reassuringly brace up muriel old girl we re most there now been a long ride for ye ain t it ye old antediluvian handful of animated carpet tacks hey now quit a tryin to kiss me don t hold on to my neck so tight this here paint hoss ain t any too shore footed let me tell ye he s liable to dump us both off if we don t watch out two minutes of waiting brought a tired paint pony single footing into camp a gangling youth of twenty lolled in the saddle of the muriel whom he had been addressing nothing was to be seen hi fellows shouted the rider cheerfully this here s a letter fer lieutenant manning he dismounted unsaddled dropped the coils of his stake rope and got his hobbles from the saddle horn while lieutenant manning in command was reading the letter the newcomer rubbed solicitously at some dried mud in the loops of the hobbles showing a consideration for the forelegs of his mount boys said the lieutenant waving his hand to the rangers this is mr james hayes he s a new member of the company captain mclean sends him down from el paso the boys will see that you have some supper hayes as soon as you get your pony hobbled the recruit was received cordially by the rangers still they observed him shrewdly and with suspended judgment picking a comrade on the border is done with ten times the care and discretion with which a girl chooses a sweetheart on your side kicker s nerve loyalty aim and coolness your own life may depend many times after a hearty supper hayes joined the smokers about the fire his appearance did not settle all the questions in the minds of his brother rangers they saw simply a loose lank youth with tow coloured sun burned hair and a berry brown ingenuous face that wore a quizzical good natured smile fellows said the new ranger i m goin to interduce to you a lady friend of mine ain t ever heard anybody call her a beauty but you ll all admit she s got some fine points about her come along muriel he held open the front of his blue flannel shirt out of it crawled a horned frog a bright red ribbon was tied jauntily around its spiky neck it crawled to its owner s knee and sat there motionless this here muriel said hayes with an oratorical wave of his hand has got qualities she never talks back she always stays at home and she s satisfied with one red dress for every day and sunday too look at that blame insect said one of the rangers with a grin i ve seen plenty of them horny frogs but i never knew anybody to have one for a side partner does the blame thing know you from anybody else take it over there and see said hayes the stumpy little lizard known as the horned frog is harmless he has the hideousness of the prehistoric monsters whose reduced descendant he is but he is gentler than the dove the ranger took muriel from hayes s knee and went back to his seat on a roll of blankets the captive twisted and clawed and struggled vigorously in his hand after holding it for a moment or two the ranger set it upon the ground awkwardly but swiftly the frog worked its four oddly moving legs until it stopped close by hayes s foot well dang my hide said the other ranger the little cuss knows you never thought them insects had that much sense ii jimmy hayes became a favourite in the ranger camp he had an endless store of good nature and a mild perennial quality of humour that is well adapted to camp life he was never without his horned frog in the bosom of his shirt during rides on h is knee or shoulder in camp under his blankets at night the ugly little beast never left him jimmy was a humourist of a type that prevails in the rural south and west unskilled in originating methods of amusing or in witty conceptions he had hit upon a comical idea and clung to it reverently it had seemed to jimmy a very funny thing to have about his person with which to amuse his friends a tame horned frog with a red ribbon around its neck as it was a happy idea why not perpetuate it the sentiments existing between jimmy and the frog cannot be exactly determined the capability of the horned frog for lasting affection is a subject upon which we have had no symposiums it is easier to guess jimmy s feelings muriel was his chef d oeuvre of wit and as such he cherished her he caught flies for her and shielded her from sudden northers yet his care was half selfish and when the time came she repaid him a thousand fold other muriels have thus overbalanced the light attentions of other jimmies not at once did jimmy hayes attain full brotherhood with his comrades they loved him for his simplicity and drollness but there hung above him a great sword of suspended judgment to make merry in camp is not all of a ranger s life there are horse thieves to trail desperate criminals to run down bravos to battle with bandits to rout out of the chaparral peace and order to be compelled at the muzzle of a six shooter jimmy had been most generally a cow puncher he said he was inexperienced in ranger methods of warfare therefore the rangers speculated apart and

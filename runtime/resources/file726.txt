rosa bonheur again a great art ist has his moods he would say cruel and cutting things for example medora had spent an after noon patiently sketching the statue and the archi tecture at columbus circle tossing it aside with a sneer the professor informed her that giotto had once drawn a perfect circle with one sweep of his hand one day it rained the weekly remittance from har mony was overdue medora had a headache the pro fessor had tried to borrow two dollars from her her art dealer had sent back all her water colors unsold and mr binkley asked her out to dinner mr binkley was the gay boy of the boarding house he was forty nine and owned a fishstall in a downtown market but after six o clock he wore an evening suit and whooped things up connected with the beaux arts the young men said he was an indian he was supposed to be an accomplished habitue of the inner circles of bohemia it was no secret that he had once loaned to a young man who had had a drawing printed in puck often has one thus obtained his entree into the charmed circle while the other obtained both his entree and roast the other boarders enviously regarded medora as she left at mr binkley s side at nine o clock she was as sweet as a cluster of dried autumn grasses in her pale blue oh er that very thin stuff in her pale blue comstockized silk waist and box pleated voile skirt with a soft pink glow on her thin cheeks and the tiniest bit of rouge powder on her face with her handkerchief and room key in her brown walrus pebble grain band bag and mr binkley looked imposing and dashing with his red face and gray mustache and his tight dress coat that made the back of his neck roll up just like a successful novelist s they drove in a cab to the cafe terence just off the most glittering part of broadway which as every one knows is one of the most popular and widely patronized jealously exclusive bohemian re sorts in the city down between the rows of little tables tripped medora of the green mountains after her escort thrice in a lifetime may woman walk upon clouds once when she trippeth to the altar once when she first enters bohemian halls the last when she marches back across her first garden with the dead hen of her neighbor in her band there was a table set with three or four about it a waiter buzzed around it like a bee and silver and glass shone upon it and preliminary to the meal as the prehistoric granite strata heralded the pro tozoa the bread of gaul compounded after the for mula of the recipe for the eternal bills was there set forth to the hand and tooth of a long suffering city while the gods lay beside their nectar and home made biscuits and smiled and the dentists leaped for joy in their gold leafy dens the eye of binkley fixed a young man at his table with the bobemian gleam which is a compound of the look of the basilisk the shine of a bubble of wurzburger the inspiration of genius and the plead ing of a panhandler the young man sprang to his feet hello

tempted to pay this philistine his ten dol lars and get rid of him madder ruffled his long sandy locks and disar ranged his careless tie don t think of it vandy he replied we are short and art is long medora ate strange viands and drank elderberry wine that they poured in her glass it was just the color of that in the vermont home the waiter poured something in another glass that seemed to be boiling but when she tasted it it was not hot she had never felt so light hearted before she thought lovingly of the green mountain farm and its fauna she leaned smiling to miss elise if i were at home she said beamingly i could show you the cutest little calf nothing for you in the white lane said miss elise why don t you pad the orchestra played a wailing waltz that medora had learned from the hand organs she followed the air with nodding head in a sweet soprano hum madder looked across the table at her and wondered in what strange waters binkley had caught her in his seine she smiled at him and they raised glasses and drank of the wine that boiled

finding her all right said the detective i guess you don t know new york but if you ve got a grouch against this scheme we ll try the other one it s a sure thing but it ll cost you more never mind the expense said meeks we ll try it the sleuth led him back to the waldorf engage a couple of bedrooms and a parlour he advised and let s go up this was done and the two were shown to a superb suite on the fourth floor meeks looked puzzled the detective sank into a velvet armchair and pulled out his cigar case i forgot to suggest old man he said that you should have taken the rooms by the month they wouldn t have stuck you so much for em by the month exclaimed meeks what do you mean oh it ll take time to work the game this way i told you it would cost you more we ll have to wait till spring there ll be a new city directory out then very likely your sister s name and address will be in it meeks rid himself of the city detective at once on the next day some one advised him to consult shamrock jolnes new york s famous private detective who demanded fabulous fees but performed miracles in the way of solving mysteries and crimes after waiting for two hours in the anteroom of the great detective s apartment meeks was shown into his presence jolnes sat in a purple dressing gown at an inlaid ivory chess table with a magazine before him trying to solve the mystery of they the famous sleuth s thin intellectual face piercing eyes and rate per word are too well known to need description meeks set forth his errand my fee if successful will be said shamrock jolnes meeks bowed his agreement to the price i will undertake your case mr meeks said jolnes finally the disappearance of people in this city has always been an interesting problem to me i remember a case that i brought to a successful outcome a year ago a family bearing the name of clark disappeared suddenly from a small flat in which they were living i watched the flat building for two months for a clue one day it struck me that a certain milkman and a grocer s boy always walked backward when they carried their wares upstairs following out by induction the idea that this observation gave me i at once located the missing family they had moved into the flat across the hall and changed their name to kralc shamrock jolnes and his client went to the tenement house where mary snyder had lived and the detective demanded to be shown the room in which she had lived it had been occupied by no tenant since her disappearance the room was small dingy and poorly furnished meeks seated himself dejectedly on a broken chair while the great detective searched the walls and floor and the few sticks of old rickety furniture for a clue at the end of half an hour jolnes had collected a few seemingly unintelligible articles a cheap black hat pin a piece torn off a theatre programme and the end of a small torn card on which was the word left and the characters c shamrock jolnes leaned against the mantel for ten minutes with his head resting upon his hand and an absorbed look upon his intellectual face at the end of that time he exclaimed with animation come mr meeks the problem is solved i can take you directly to the house where your sister is living and you may have no fears concerning her welfare for she is amply provided with funds for the present at least meeks felt joy and wonder in equal proportions how did you manage it he asked with admiration in his tones perhaps jolnes s only weakness was a professional pride in his wonderful achievements in induction he was ever ready to astound and charm his listeners by describing his methods by elimination said jolnes spreading his clues upon a little table i got rid of certain parts of the city to which mrs snyder might have removed you see this hatpin that eliminates brooklyn no woman attempts to board a car at the brooklyn bridge without being sure that she carries a hatpin with which to fight her way into a seat and now i will demonstrate to you that she could not have gone to harlem behind this door are two hooks in the wall upon one of these mrs snyder has hung her bonnet and upon the other her shawl you will observe that the bottom of the hanging shawl has gradually made a soiled streak against the plastered wall the mark is clean cut proving that there is no fringe on the shawl now was there ever a case where a middle aged woman wearing a shawl boarded a harlem train without there being a fringe on the shawl to catch in the gate and delay the passengers behind her so we eliminate harlem therefore i conclude that mrs snyder has not moved very far away on this torn piece of card you see the word left the letter c and the number now i happen to know that no avenue c is a first class boarding house far beyond your sister s means as we suppose but then i find this piece of a theatre programme crumpled into an odd shape what meaning does it convey none to you very likely mr meeks but it is eloquent to one whose habits and training take cognizance of the small est things you have told me that your sister was a scrub woman she scrubbed the floors of offices and hallways let us assume that she procured such work to perform in a theatre where is valuable jewellery lost the oftenest

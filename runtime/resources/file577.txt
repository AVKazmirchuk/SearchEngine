him up occasionally when his pulse and respiration are normal then let him sleep i ll leave him with you now i was left alone with tom whom we had laid on a couch he lay very still and his eyes were half closed i began my work of keeping him awake well old man i said you ve had a narrow squeak but we ve pulled you through when you were attending lectures tom didn t any of the professors ever casually remark that m o r p h i a never spells quinia especially in four grain doses but i won t pile it up on you until you get on your feet but you ought to have been a druggist tom you re splendidly qualified to fill prescriptions tom looked at me with a faint and foolish smile b ly he murmured i feel jus like a hum n bird flyin around a jolly lot of most shpensive roses don bozzer me goin sleep now and he went to sleep in two seconds i shook him by the shoulder now tom i said severely this won t do the big doctor said you must stay awake for at least an hour open your eyes you re not entirely safe yet you know wake up tom hopkins weighs one hundred and ninety eight he gave me another somnolent grin and fell into deeper slumber i would have made him move about but i might as well have tried to make cleopatra s needle waltz around the room with me tom s breathing became stertorous and that in connection with morphia poisoning means danger then i began to think i could not rouse his body i must strive to excite his mind make him angry was an idea that suggested itself good i thought but how there was not a joint in tom s armour dear old fellow he was good nature itself and a gallant gentleman fine and true and clean as sunlight he came from somewhere down south where they still have ideals and a code new york had charmed but had not spoiled him he had that old fashioned chivalrous reverence for women that eur eka there was my idea i worked the thing up for a minute or two in my imagination i chuckled to myself at the thought of springing a thing like that on old tom hopkins then i took him by the shoulder and shook him till his ears flopped he opened his eyes lazily i assumed an expression of scorn and contempt and pointed my finger within two inches of his nose listen to me hopkins i said in cutting and distinct tones you and i have been good friends but i want you to understand that in the future my doors are closed against any man who acts as much like a scoundrel as you have tom looked the least bit interested what s the matter billy he muttered composedly don t your clothes fit you if i were in your place i went on which thank god i am not i think i would be afraid to close my eyes how about that girl you left waiting for you down among those lonesome southern pines the girl that you ve forgotten since you came into your confounded money oh i know what i m talking about while you were a poor medical student she was good enough for you but now since you are a millionaire it s different i wonder what she thinks of the performances of that peculiar class of people which she has been taught to worship the southern gentlemen i m sorry hopkins that i was forced to speak about these matters but you ve covered it up so well and played your part so nicely that i would have sworn you were above such unmanly tricks poor tom i could scarcely keep from laughing outright to see him struggling against the effects of the opiate he was distinctly angry and i didn t blame him tom had a southern temper his eyes were open now and they showed a gleam or two of fire but the drug still clouded his mind and bound his tongue c c confound you he stammered i ll s smash you he tried to rise from the couch with all his size he was very weak now i thrust him back with one arm he lay there glaring like a lion in a trap that will hold you for a while you old loony i said to myself i got up and lit my pipe for i was needing a smoke i walked around a bit congratulating myself on my brilliant idea i heard a snore i looked around tom was asleep again i walked over and punched him on the jaw he looked at me as pleasant and ungrudging as an idiot i chewed my pipe and gave it to him hard i want you to recover yourself and get out of my rooms as soon as you can i said insultingly i ve told you what i think of you if you have any honour or honesty left you will think twice before you attempt again to associate with gentlemen she s a poor girl isn t she i sneered somewhat too plain and unfashionable for us since we got our money be ashamed to walk on fifth avenue with her wouldn t you hopkins you re forty seven times worse than a cad who cares for your money i don t i ll bet that girl don t perhaps if you didn t have it you d be more of a man as it is you ve made a cur of yourself and i thought that quite dramatic perhaps broken a faithful heart old tom hopkins breaking a faithful heart let me be rid of you as soon as possible i turned my back on tom

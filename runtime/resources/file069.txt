the quiver of momus reconstructing mythology he had risen a prismatic macaw from the ashes of the grey brown phoenix that had folded its tired wings to roost under the trees of santa rosa dry valley paused in the street to allow santa rosans within sight of him to be stunned and then deliberately and slowly as his shoes required entered mrs o brien s gate not until the eleven months drought did santa rosa cease talking about dry valley johnson s courtship of panchita o brien it was an unclassifiable procedure something like a combination of cake walking deaf and dumb oratory postage stamp flirtation and parlour charades it lasted two weeks and then came to a sudden end of course mrs o brien favoured the match as soon as dry valley s intentions were disclosed being the mother of a woman child and therefore a charter member of the ancient order of the rat trap she joyfully decked out panchita for the sacrifice the girl was temporarily dazzled by having her dresses lengthened and her hair piled up on her head and came near forgetting that she was only a slice of cheese it was nice too to have as good a match as mr johnson paying you attentions and to see the other girls fluttering the curtains at their windows to see you go by with him dry valley bought a buggy with yellow wheels and a fine trotter in san antonio every day he drove out with panchita he was never seen to speak to her when they were walking or driving the consciousness of his clothes kept his mind busy the knowledge that he could say nothing of interest kept him dumb the feeling that panchita was there kept him happy he took her to parties and dances and to church he tried oh no man ever tried so hard to be young as dry valley did he could not dance but he invented a smile which he wore on these joyous occasions a smile that in him was as great a concession to mirth and gaiety as turning hand springs would be in another he began to seek the company of the young men in the town even of the boys they accepted him as a decided damper for his attempts at sportiveness were so forced that they might as well have essayed their games in a cathedral neither he nor any other could estimate what progress he had made with panchita the end came suddenly in one day as often disappears the false afterglow before a november sky and wind dry valley was to call for the girl one afternoon at six for a walk an afternoon walk in santa rosa was a feature of social life that called for the pink of one s wardrobe so dry valley began gorgeously to array himself and so early that he finished early and went over to the o brien cottage as he neared the porch on the crooked walk from the gate he heard sounds of revelry within he stopped and looked through the honeysuckle vines in the open door panchita was amusing her younger brothers and sisters she wore a man s clothes no doubt those of the late mr o brien on her head was the smallest brother s straw hat decorated with an ink striped paper band on her hands were flapping yellow cloth gloves roughly cut out and sewn for the masquerade the same material covered her shoes giving them the semblance of tan leather high collar and flowing necktie were not omitted panchita was an actress dry valley saw his affectedly youthful gait his limp where the right shoe hurt him his forced smile his awkward simulation of a gallant air all reproduced with startling fidelity for the first time a mirror had been held up to him the corroboration of one of the youngsters calling mamma come and see pancha do like mr johnson was not needed as softly as the caricatured tans would permit dry valley tiptoed back to the gate and home again twenty minutes after the time appointed for the walk panchita tripped demurely out of her gate in a thin trim white lawn and sailor hat she strolled up the sidewalk and slowed her steps at dry valley s gate her manner expressing wonder at his unusual delinquency then out of his door and down the walk strode not the polychromatic victim of a lost summertime but the sheepman rehabilitated he wore his old grey woolen shirt open at the throat his brown duck trousers stuffed into his run over boots and his white felt sombrero on the back of his head twenty years or fifty he might look dry valley cared not his light blue eyes met panchita s dark ones with a cold flash in them he came as far as the gate he pointed with his long arm to her house go home said dry valley go home to your mother i wonder lightnin don t strike a fool like me go home and play in the sand what business have you got cavortin around with grown men i reckon i was locoed to be makin a he poll parrot out of myself for a kid like you go home and don t let me see you no more why i done it will somebody tell me go home and let me try and forget it panchita obeyed and walked slowly toward her home saying nothing for some distance she kept her head turned and her large eyes fixed intrepidly upon dry valley s at her gate she stood for a moment looking back at him then ran suddenly and swiftly into the house old antonia was building a fire in the kitchen stove dry valley stopped at the door and laughed harshly i m a pretty looking old rhinoceros to be gettin stuck on a kid ain t i tonia

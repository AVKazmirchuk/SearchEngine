he knew that the hours of his captivity were numbered and he hummed in time with the sentry s tread they re hanging men and women now for lacking of the green so that night dicky sat by the window of the room over his shop an his little saint sat close by working at something silken and dainty dicky was thoughtful and grave his red hair was in an unusual state of disorder pasa s fingers often ached to smooth and arrange it but dicky would never allow it he was poring tonight over a great litter of maps and books and papers on his table until that perpendicular line came between his brows that always distressed pasa presently she went and brought his hat and stood with it until he looked up inquiringly it is sad for you here she explained go out and drink vino blanco come back when you get that smile you used to wear that is what i wish to see dicky laughed and threw down his papers the vino blanco stage is past it has served its turn perhaps after all there was less entered my mouth and more my ears than people thought but there will be no more maps or frowns tonight i promise you that come they sat upon a reed silleta at the window and watched the quivering gleams from the lights of the catarina reflected in the harbor presently pasa rippled out one of her infrequent chirrups of audible laughter i was thinking she began anticipating dicky s question of the foolish things girls have in their minds because i went to school in the states i used to have ambitions nothing less than to be the president s wife would satisfy me and look thou red picaroon to what obscure fate thou hast stolen me don t give up hope said dicky smiling more than one irishman has been the ruler of a south american country there was a dictator of chili named o higgins why not a president maloney of anchuria say the word santita mia and we ll make the race no no no thou red haired reckless one sighed pasa i am content she laid her head against his arm here xvi rouge et noir it has been indicated that disaffection followed the elevation of losada to the presidency this feeling continued to grow throughout the entire republic there seemed to be a spirit of silent sullen discontent even the old liberal party to which goodwin zavalla and other patriots had lent their aid was disappointed losada had failed to become a popular idol fresh taxes fresh import duties and more than all his tolerance of the outrageous oppression of citizens by the military had rendered him the most obnoxious president since the despicable alforan the majority of his own cabinet were out of sympathy with him the army which he had courted by giving it license to tyrannize had been his main and thus far adequate support but the most impolitic of the administration s moves had been when it antagonized the vesuvius fruit company an organization plying twelve steamers with a cash capital somewhat larger than anchuria s surplus and debt combined reasonably an established concern like the vesuvius would become irritated at having a small retail republic with no rating at all attempt to squeeze it so when the government proxies applied for a subsidy they encountered a polite refusal the president at once retaliated by clapping an export duty of one real per bunch on bananas a thing unprecedented in fruit growing countries the vesuvius company had invested large sums in wharves

sandbagging in behalf of anchuria the meeting took place in the cabin of the salvador of the vesuvius line senor espirition opened negotiations by announcing that the government contemplated the building of a railroad to skirt the alluvial coast lands after touching upon the benefits such a road would confer upon the interests of the vesuvius he reached the definite suggestion that a contribution to the road s expenses of say fifty thousand pesos would not be more than an equivalent to benefits received mr franzoni denied that his company would receive any benefits from a contemplated road as its representative he must decline to contribute fifty thousand pesos but he would assume the responsibility of offering twenty five did senor espirition understand senor franzoni to mean twenty five thousand pesos by no means twenty five pesos and in silver not in gold your offer insults my government cried senor espirition rising with indignation then said mr franzoni in warning tone we will change it the offer was never changed could mr franzoni have meant the government this was the state of affairs in anchuria when the winter season opened at coralio at the end of the second year of losada s administration so when the government and society made its annual exodus to

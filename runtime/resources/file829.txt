laugh floated up from the patent room below the man who carried down the denny file was exhibiting it among the clerks look here he said delightedly the old man has forgotten his name he s written patent to original grantee and signed it georgia summerfield comr the speech of the commissioner rebounded lightly from the impregnable hamlin and avery they smiled rose gracefully spoke of the baseball team and argued feelingly that quite a perceptible breeze had arisen from the east they lit fresh fat brown cigars and drifted courteously away but later they made another tiger spring for their quarry in the courts but the courts according to reports in the papers coolly roasted them a remarkable performance suggestive of liquid air didoes and sustained the commissioner s ruling and this ruling itself grew to be a precedent and the actual settler framed it and taught his children to spell from it and there was sound sleep o nights from the pines to the sage brush and from the chaparral to the great brown river of the north but i think and i am sure the commissioner never thought otherwise that whether kampfer was a snuffy old instrument of destiny or whether the meanders

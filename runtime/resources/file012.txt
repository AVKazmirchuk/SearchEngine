was compressed in it i forgot the snow and i forgot that me and old idaho was on the outs he was sitting still on a stool reading away with a kind of partly soft and partly mysterious look shining through his tan bark whiskers idaho says i what kind of a book is yours idaho must have forgot too for he answered moderate without any slander or malignity why says he this here seems to be a volume by homer k m homer k m what i asks why just homer k m says he you re a liar says i a little riled that idaho should try to put me up a tree no man is going round signing books with his initials if it s homer k m spoopendyke or homer k m mcsweeney or homer k m jones why don t you say so like a man instead of biting off the end of it like a calf chewing off the tail of a shirt on a clothes line i put it to you straight sandy says idaho quiet it s a poem book says he by homer k m i couldn t get colour out of it at first but there s a vein if you follow it up i wouldn t have missed this book for a pair of red blankets you re welcome to it says i what i want is a disinterested statement of facts for the mind to work on and that s what i seem to find in the book i ve drawn what you ve got says idaho is statistics the lowest grade of information that exists they ll poison your mind give me old k m s system of surmises he seems to be a kind of a wine agent his regular toast is nothing doing and he seems to have a grouch but he keeps it so well lubricated with booze that his worst kicks sound like an invitation to split a quart but it s poetry says idaho and i have sensations of scorn for that truck of yours that tries to convey sense in feet and inches when it comes to explaining the instinct of philosophy through the art of nature old k m has got your man beat by drills rows paragraphs chest measurement and average annual rainfall so that s the way me and idaho had it day and night all the excitement we got was studying our books that snowstorm sure fixed us with a fine lot of attainments apiece by the time the snow melted if you had stepped up to me suddenly and said sanderson pratt what would it cost per square foot to lay a roof with twenty by twenty eight tin at nine dollars and fifty cents per box i d have told you as quick as light could travel the length of a spade handle at the rate of one hundred and ninety two thousand miles per second how many can do it you wake up most any man you know in the middle of the night and ask him quick to tell you the number of bones in the human skeleton exclusive of the teeth or what percentage of the vote of the nebraska legislature overrules a veto will he tell you try him and see about what benefit idaho got out of his poetry book i didn t exactly know idaho boosted the wine agent every time he opened his mouth but i wasn t so sure this homer k m from what leaked out of his libretto through idaho seemed to me to be a kind of a dog who looked at life like it was a tin can tied to his tail after running himself half to death he sits down hangs his tongue out and looks at the can and says oh well since we can t shake the growler let s get it filled at the corner and all have a drink on me besides that it seems he was a persian and i never hear of persia producing anything worth mentioning unless it was turkish rugs and maltese cats that spring me and idaho struck pay ore it was a habit of ours to sell out quick and keep moving we unloaded our grubstaker for eight thousand dollars apiece and then we drifted down to this little town of rosa on the salmon river to rest up and get some human grub and have our whiskers harvested rosa was no mining camp it laid in the valley and was as free of uproar and pestilence as one of them rural towns in the country there was a three mile trolley line champing its bit in the environs and me and idaho spent a week riding on one of the cars dropping off at nights at the sunset view hotel being now well read as well as travelled we was soon pro re nata with the best society in rosa and was invited out to the most dressed up and high toned entertainments it was at a piano recital and quail eating contest in the city hall for the benefit of the fire company that me and idaho first met mrs de ormond sampson the queen of rosa society mrs sampson was a widow and owned the only two story house in town it was painted yellow and whichever way you looked from you could see it as plain as egg on the chin of an o grady on a friday twenty two men in rosa besides me and idaho was trying to stake a claim on that yellow house there was a dance after the song books and quail bones had been raked out of the hall twenty three of the bunch galloped over to mrs sampson and asked for a dance i side stepped the two step and asked permission to escort her home that s where i made

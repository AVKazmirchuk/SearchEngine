or style and appeared to be covered with the dust of travel you make a specialty of divorce cases he said in an agitated but business like tone i may say began lawyer gooch that my prac tice has not altogether avoided i know you do interrupted client number three you needn t tell me i ve heard all about you i have a case to lay before you without necessarily disclosing any connection that i might have with it that is you wish said lawyer gooch to state a hvpo thetical case you may call it that i am a plain man of business i will be as brief as possible we will first take up hypothetical woman we will say she is married uncon genially in many ways she is a superior woman phys ically she is considered to be handsome she is devoted to what she calls literature poetry and prose and such stuff her husband is a plain man in the business walks of life their home has not been happy although the husband has tried to make it so some time ago a man a stranger came to the peaceful town in which they lived and engaged in some real estate operations this woman met him and became unaccountably infatu ated with him her attentions became so open that the man felt the community to be no safe place for him so he left it she abandoned husband and home and followed him she forsook her home where she was provided with every comfort to follow this man who had inspired her with such a strange affection is there any thing more to be deplored concluded the client in a trembling voice than the wrecking of a home by a woman s uncalculating folly lawyer gooch delivered the cautious opinion that there was not this man she has gone to join resumed the visitor is not the man to make her happy it is a wild and foolish self deception that makes her think he will her husband in spite of their many disagreements is the only one capable of dealing with her sensitive and peculiar nature but this she does not realize now would you consider a divorce the logical cure in the case you present asked lawyer gooch who felt that the conversation was wandering too far from the field of business a divorce exclaimed the client feelingly almost tearfully no no not that i have read mr gooch of many instances where your sympathy and kindly inter est led you to act as a mediator between estranged hus band and wife and brought them together again let us drop the hypothetical case i need conceal no longer that it is i who am the sufferer in this sad affair the names you shall have thomas r billings and wife and henry k jessup the man with whom she is infatuated client number three laid his hand upon mr gooch s arm deep emotion was written upon his careworn face for heaven s sake he said fervently help me in this hour of trouble seek out mrs billings and persuade her to abandon this distressing pursuit of her lamentable folly tell her mr gooch that her husband is willing to receive her back to his heart and home promise her anything that will induce her to return i have heard of your success in these matters mrs bil lings cannot be very far away i am worn out with travel and weariness twice during the pursuit i saw her but various circumstances prevented our having an inter view will you undertake this mission for me mr gooch and earn my everlasting gratitude it is true said lawver gooch frowning slightly at the other s last words but immediately calling up an expression of virtuous benevolence that on a number of occasions i have been successful in persuading couples who sought the severing of their matrimonial bonds to think better of their rash intentions and return to their homes reconciled but i assure you that the work is often exceedingly difficult the amount of argument perseverance and if i may be allowed to say it eloquence that it requires would astonish you but this is a case in which my sympathies would be wholly enlisted i feel deeply for you sir and i would be most happy to see husband and wife reunited but my time concluded the lawyer looking at his watch as if suddenly reminded of the fact is valuable i am aware of that said the client and if you will take the case and persuade mrs billings to return home and leave the man alone that she is following on that day i will pay you the sum of one thousand dollars i have made a little money in real estate during the recent boom in susanville and i will not begrudge that amount retain your seat for a few moments please said lawyer gooch arising and again consulting his watch i have another client waiting in an adjoining room whom i had very nearly forgotten i will return in the briefest possible space the situation was now one that fully satisfied lawyer gooch s love of intricacy and complication he revelled in cases that presented such subtle problems and possi bilities it pleased him to think that he was master of the happiness and fate of the three individuals who sat uncon cious of one another s presence within his reach his old figure of the ship glided into his mind but now the figure failed for to have filled every compartment of an actual vessel would have been to endanger her safety with his compartments full his ship of affairs could but sail on to the

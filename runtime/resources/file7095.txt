and said well really to everything you said sat on the top step and sniffed and miss dorn who shot at the moving ducks at coney every sunday and worked in a department store sat on the bottom step and sniffed miss leeson sat on the middle step and the men would quickly group around her especially mr skidder who had cast her in his mind for the star part in a private romantic unspoken drama in real life and especially mr hoover who was forty five fat flush and foolish and especially very young mr evans who set up a hollow cough to induce her to ask him to leave off cigarettes the men voted her the funniest and jolliest ever but the sniffs on the top step and the lower step were implacable i pray you let the drama halt while chorus stalks to the footlights and drops an epicedian tear upon the fatness of mr hoover tune the pipes to the tragedy of tallow the bane of bulk the calamity of corpulence tried out falstaff might have rendered more romance to the ton than would have romeo s rickety ribs to the ounce a lover may sigh but he must not puff to the train of momus are the fat men remanded in vain beats the faithfullest heart above a inch belt avaunt hoover hoover forty five flush and foolish might carry off helen herself hoover forty five flush foolish and fat is meat for perdition there was never a chance for you hoover as mrs parker s roomers sat thus one summer s evening miss leeson looked up into the firmament and cried with her little gay laugh why there s billy jackson i can see him from down here too all looked up some at the windows of skyscrapers some casting about for an airship jackson guided it s that star explained miss leeson pointing with a tiny finger not the big one that twinkles the steady blue one near it i can see it every night through my skylight i named it billy jackson well really said miss longnecker i didn t know you were an astronomer miss leeson oh yes said the small star gazer i know as much as any of them about the style of sleeves they re going to wear next fall in mars well really said miss longnecker the star you refer to is gamma of the constellation cassiopeia it is nearly of the second magnitude and its meridian passage is oh said the very young mr evans i think billy jackson is a much better name for it same here said mr hoover loudly breathing defiance to miss longnecker i think miss leeson has just as much right to name stars as any of those old astrologers had well really said miss longnecker i wonder whether it s a shooting star remarked miss dorn i hit nine ducks and a rabbit out of ten in the gallery at coney sunday he doesn t show up very well from down here said miss leeson you ought to see him from my room you know you can see stars even in the daytime from the bottom of a well at night my room is like the shaft of a coal mine and it makes billy jackson look like the big diamond pin that night fastens her kimono with there came a time after that when miss leeson brought no formidable papers home to copy and when she went out in the morning instead of working she went from office to office and let her heart melt away in the drip of cold refusals transmitted through insolent office boys this went on there came an evening when she wearily climbed mrs parker s stoop at the hour when she always returned from her dinner at the restaurant but she had had no dinner as she stepped into the hall mr hoover met her and seized his chance he asked her to marry him and his fatness hovered above her like an avalanche she dodged and caught the balustrade he tried for her hand and she raised it and smote him weakly in the face step by step she went up dragging herself by the railing she passed mr skidder s door as he was red inking a stage direction for myrtle delorme miss leeson in his unaccepted comedy to pirouette across stage from l to the side of the count up the carpeted ladder she crawled at last and opened the door of the skylight room she was too weak to light the lamp or to undress she fell upon the iron cot her fragile body scarcely hollowing the worn springs and in that erebus of the skylight room she slowly raised her heavy eyelids and smiled for billy jackson was shining down on her calm and bright and constant through the skylight there was no world about her she was sunk in a pit of blackness with but that small square of pallid light framing the star that she had so whimsically and oh so ineffectually named miss longnecker must be right it was gamma of the constellation cassiopeia and not billy jackson and yet she could not let it be gamma as she lay on her back she tried twice to raise her arm the third time she got two thin fingers to her lips and blew a kiss out of the black pit to billy jackson her arm fell back limply good bye billy she murmured faintly you re millions of miles away and you won t even twinkle once but you kept where i could see you most of the time up there when there wasn t anything else but darkness to look at didn t you millions of miles good bye billy jackson clara the coloured maid found the door locked at the next day and they forced it open vinegar and the slapping of wrists and burnt feathers proving of no avail some one ran to phone for an ambulance in due time it backed up to the door with much gong clanging and the capable young medico in his white linen coat ready active confident with his smooth face half debonair half grim danced up the steps ambulance call to he said briefly what s the trouble oh yes doctor sniffed mrs parker as though her trouble that there should be trouble in the house was the greater i can t think what can be the matter with her nothing we could do would bring her to it s a young woman a miss elsie yes a miss elsie leeson never before in my house what room cried the doctor in a terrible voice to which mrs parker was a stranger the skylight room it evidently the ambulance doctor was familiar with the location of skylight rooms he was gone up the stairs four at a time mrs parker followed slowly as her dignity demanded on the first landing she met him coming back bearing the astronomer in his arms he stopped and let loose the practised scalpel of his tongue not loudly gradually mrs parker crumpled as a stiff garment that slips down from a nail ever afterward there remained crumples in her mind and body sometimes her curious roomers would ask her what the doctor said to her let that be she would answer if i can get forgiveness for having heard it i will be satisfied the ambulance physician strode with his burden through the pack of hounds that follow the curiosity chase and even they fell back along the sidewalk abashed for his face was that of one who bears his own dead they noticed that he did not lay down upon the bed prepared for it in the ambulance the form that he carried and all that he said was drive like h l wilson to the driver that is all is it a story in the next morning s paper i saw a little news item and the last sentence of it may help you as it helped me to weld the incidents together it recounted the reception into bellevue hospital of a young woman who had been removed from no east street suffering from debility induced by starvation it concluded with these words dr william jackson the ambulance physician who attended the case says the patient will recover a service of love when one loves one s art no service seems too hard that is our premise this story shall draw a conclusion from it and show at the same time that the premise is incorrect that will be a new thing in logic and a feat in story telling somewhat older than the great wall of china joe larrabee came out of the post oak flats of the middle west pulsing with a genius for pictorial art at six he drew a picture of the town pump with a prominent citizen passing it hastily this effort was framed and hung in the drug store window by the side of the ear of corn with an uneven number of rows at twenty he left for new york with a flowing necktie and a capital tied up somewhat closer delia caruthers did things in six octaves so promisingly in a pine tree village in the south that her relatives chipped in enough in her chip hat for her to go north and finish they could not see her f but that is our story joe and delia met in an atelier where a number of art and music students had gathered to discuss chiaroscuro wagner music rembrandt s works pictures waldteufel wall paper chopin and oolong joe and delia became enamoured one of the other or each of the other as you please and in a short time were married for see above when one loves one s art no service seems too hard mr and mrs larrabee began housekeeping in a flat it was a lonesome flat something like the a sharp way down at the left hand end of the keyboard and they were happy for they had their art and they had each other and my advice to the rich young man would be sell all thou hast and give it to the poor janitor for the privilege of living in a flat with your art and your delia flat dwellers shall indorse my dictum that theirs is the only true happiness if a home is happy it cannot fit too close let the dresser collapse and become a billiard table let the mantel turn to a rowing machine the escritoire to a spare bedchamber the washstand to an upright piano let the four walls come together if they will so you and your delia are between but if home be the other kind let it be wide and long enter you at the golden gate hang your hat on hatteras your cape on cape horn and go out by the labrador joe was painting in the class of the great magister you know his fame his fees are high his lessons are light his high lights have brought him renown delia was studying under rosenstock you know his repute as a disturber of the piano keys they were mighty happy as long as their money lasted so is every but i will not be cynical their aims were very clear and defined joe was to become capable very soon of turning out pictures that old gentlemen with thin side whiskers and thick pocketbooks would sandbag one another in his studio for the privilege of buying delia was to become familiar and then contemptuous with music so that when she saw the orchestra seats and boxes unsold she could have sore throat and lobster in a private dining room and refuse to go on the stage but the best in my opinion was the home life in the little flat the ardent voluble chats after the day s study the cozy dinners and fresh light breakfasts the interchange of ambitions ambitions interwoven each with the other s or else inconsiderable the mutual help and inspiration and overlook my artlessness stuffed olives and cheese sandwiches at p m but after a while art flagged it sometimes does even if some switchman doesn t flag it everything going out and nothing coming in as the vulgarians say money was lacking to pay mr magister and herr rosenstock their prices when one loves one s art no service seems too hard so delia said she must give music lessons to keep the chafing dish bubbling for two or three days she went out canvassing for pupils one evening she came home elated joe dear she said gleefully i ve a pupil and oh the loveliest people general general a b pinkney s daughter on seventy first street such a splendid house joe you ought to see the front door byzantine i think you would call it and inside oh joe i never saw anything like it before my pupil is his daughter clementina i dearly love her already she s a delicate thing dresses always in white and the sweetest simplest manners only eighteen years old i m to give three lessons a week and just think joe a lesson i don t mind it a bit for when i get two or three more pupils i can resume my lessons with herr rosenstock now smooth out that wrinkle between your brows dear and let s have a nice supper that s all right for you dele said joe attacking a can of peas with a carving knife and a hatchet but how about me do you think i m going to let you hustle for wages while i philander in the regions of high art not by the bones of benvenuto cellini i guess i can sell papers or lay cobblestones and bring in a dollar or two delia came and hung about his neck joe dear you are silly you must keep on at your studies it is not as if i had quit my music and gone to work at something else while i teach i learn i am always with my music and we can live as happily as millionaires on a week you mustn t think of leaving mr magister all right said joe reaching for the blue scalloped vegetable dish but i hate for you to be giving lessons it isn t art but you re a trump and a dear to do it when one loves one s art no service seems too hard said delia magister praised the sky in that sketch i made in the park said joe and tinkle gave me permission to hang two of them in his window i may sell one if the right kind of a moneyed idiot sees them i m sure you will said delia sweetly and now let s be thankful for gen pinkney and this veal roast during all of the next week the larrabees had an early breakfast joe was enthusiastic about some morning effect sketches he was doing in central park and delia packed him off breakfasted coddled praised and kissed at o clock art is an engaging mistress it was most times o clock when he returned in the evening at the end of the week delia sweetly proud but languid triumphantly tossed three five dollar bills on the x inches centre table of the x feet flat parlour sometimes she said a little wearily clementina tries me i m afraid she doesn t practise enough and i have to tell her the same things so often and then she always dresses entirely in white and that does get monotonous but gen pinkney is the dearest old man i wish you could know him joe he comes in sometimes when i am with clementina at the piano he is a widower you know and stands there pulling his white goatee and how are the semiquavers and the demisemiquavers progressing he always asks i wish you could see the wainscoting in that drawing room joe and those astrakhan rug portieres and clementina has such a funny little cough i hope she is stronger than she looks oh i really am getting attached to her she is so gentle and high bred gen pinkney s brother was once minister to bolivia and then joe with the air of a monte cristo drew forth a ten a five a two and a one all legal tender notes and laid them beside delia s earnings sold that watercolour of the obelisk to a man from peoria he announced overwhelmingly don t joke with me said delia not from peoria all the way i wish you could see him dele fat man with a woollen muffler and a quill toothpick he saw the sketch in tinkle s window and thought it was a windmill at first he was game though and bought it anyhow he ordered another an oil sketch of the lackawanna freight depot to take back with him music lessons oh i guess art is still in it i m so glad you ve kept on said delia heartily you re bound to win dear thirty three dollars we never had so much to spend before we ll have oysters to night and filet mignon with champignons said joe were is the olive fork on the next saturday evening joe reached home first he spread his on the parlour table and washed what seemed to be a great deal of dark paint from his hands half an hour later delia arrived her right hand tied up in a shapeless bundle of wraps and bandages how is this asked joe after the usual greetings delia laughed but not very joyously clementina she explained insisted upon a welsh rabbit after her lesson she is such a queer girl welsh rabbits at in the afternoon the general was there you should have seen him run for the chafing dish joe just as if there wasn t a servant in the house i know clementina isn t in good health she is so nervous in serving the rabbit she spilled a great lot of it boiling hot over my hand and wrist it hurt awfully joe and the dear girl was so sorry but gen pinkney joe that old man nearly went distracted he rushed downstairs and sent somebody they said the furnace man or somebody in the basement out to a drug store for some oil and things to bind it up with it doesn t hurt so much now what s this asked joe taking the hand tenderly and pulling at some white strands beneath the bandages it s something soft said delia that had oil on it oh joe did you sell another sketch she had seen the money on the table did i said joe just ask the man from peoria he got his depot to day and he isn t sure but he thinks he wants another parkscape and a view on the hudson what time this afternoon did you burn your hand dele five o clock i think said dele plaintively the iron i mean the rabbit came off the fire about that time you ought to have seen gen pinkney joe when sit down here a moment dele said joe he drew her to the couch sat beside her and put his arm across her shoulders what have you been doing for the last two weeks dele he asked she braved it for a moment or two with an eye full of love and stubbornness and murmured a phrase or two vaguely of gen pinkney but at length down went her head and out came the truth and tears i couldn t get any pupils she confessed and i couldn t bear to have you give up your lessons and i got a place ironing shirts in that big twentyfourth street laundry and i think i did very well to make up both general pinkney and clementina don t you joe and when a girl in the laundry set down a hot iron on my hand this afternoon i was all the way home making up that story about the welsh rabbit you re not angry are you joe and if i hadn t got the work you mightn t have sold your sketches to that man from peoria he wasn t from peoria said joe slowly well it doesn t matter where he was from how clever you are joe and kiss me joe and what made you ever suspect that i wasn t giving music lessons to clementina i didn t said joe until to night and i wouldn t have then only i sent up this cotton waste and oil from the engine room this afternoon for a girl upstairs who had her hand burned with a smoothing iron i ve been firing the engine in that laundry for the last two weeks and then you didn t my purchaser from peoria said joe and gen pinkney are both creations of the same art but you wouldn t call it either painting or music and then they both laughed and joe began when one loves one s art no service seems but delia stopped him with her hand on his lips no she said just when one loves the coming out of maggie eevery saturday night the clover leaf social club gave a hop in the hall of the give and take athletic association on the east side in order to attend one of these dances you must be a member of the give and take or if you belong to the division that starts off with the right foot in waltzing you must work in rhinegold s paper box factory still any clover leaf was privileged to escort or be escorted by an outsider to a single dance but mostly each give and take brought the paper box girl that he affected and few strangers could boast of having shaken a foot at the regular hops maggie toole on account of her dull eyes broad mouth and left handed style of footwork in the twostep went to the dances with anna mccarty and her fellow anna and maggie worked side by side in the factory and were the greatest chums ever so anna always made jimmy burns take her by maggie s house every saturday night so that her friend could go to the dance with them the give and take athletic association lived up to its name the hall of the association in orchard street was fitted out with muscle making inventions with the fibres thus builded up the members were wont to engage the police and rival social and athletic organisations in joyous combat between these more serious occupations the saturday night hop with the paper box factory girls came as a refining influence and as an efficient screen for sometimes the tip went round and if you were among the elect that tiptoed up the dark back stairway you might see as neat and satisfying a little welter weight affair to a finish as ever happened inside the ropes on saturdays rhinegold s paper box factory closed at p m on one such afternoon anna and maggie walked homeward together at maggie s door anna said as usual be ready at seven sharp mag and jimmy and me ll come by for you but what was this instead of the customary humble and grateful thanks from the non escorted one there was to be perceived a high poised head a prideful dimpling at the corners of a broad mouth and almost a sparkle in a dull brown eye thanks anna said maggie but you and jimmy needn t bother to night i ve a gentleman friend that s coming round to escort me to the hop the comely anna pounced upon her friend shook her chided and beseeched her maggie toole catch a fellow plain dear loyal unattractive maggie so sweet as a chum so unsought for a two step or a moonlit bench in the little park how was it when did it happen who was it you ll see to night said maggie flushed with the wine of the first grapes she had gathered in cupid s vineyard he s swell all right he s two inches taller than jimmy and an up to date dresser i ll introduce him anna just as soon as we get to the hall anna and jimmy were among the first clover leafs to arrive that evening anna s eyes were brightly fixed upon the door of the hall to catch the first glimpse of her friend s catch at miss toole swept into the hall with her escort quickly her triumphant eye discovered her chum under the wing of her faithful jimmy oh gee cried anna mag ain t made a hit oh no swell fellow well i guess style look at um go as far as you like said jimmy with sandpaper in his voice cop him out if you want him these new guys always win out with the push don t mind me he don t squeeze all the limes i guess huh shut up jimmy you know what i mean i m glad for mag first fellow she ever had oh here they come across the floor maggie sailed like a coquettish yacht convoyed by a stately cruiser and truly her companion justified the encomiums of the faithful chum he stood two inches taller than the average give and take athlete his dark hair curled his eyes and his teeth flashed whenever he bestowed his frequent smiles the young men of the clover leaf club pinned not their faith to the graces of person as much as they did to its prowess its achievements in hand to hand conflicts and its preservation from the legal duress that constantly menaced it the member of the association who would bind a paperbox maiden to his conquering chariot scorned to employ beau brummel airs they were not considered honourable methods of warfare the swelling biceps the coat straining at its buttons over the chest the air of conscious conviction of the supereminence of the male in the cosmogony of creation even a calm display of bow legs as subduing and enchanting agents in the gentle tourneys of cupid these were the approved arms and ammunition of the clover leaf gallants they viewed then genuflexions and alluring poses of this visitor with their chins at a new angle a friend of mine mr terry o sullivan was maggie s formula of introduction she led him around the room presenting him to each new arriving clover leaf almost was she pretty now with the unique luminosity in her eyes that comes to a girl with her first suitor and a kitten with its first mouse maggie toole s got a fellow at last was the word that went round among the paper box girls pipe mag s floor walker thus the give and takes expressed their indifferent contempt usually at the weekly hops maggie kept a spot on the wall warm with her back she felt and showed so much gratitude whenever a self sacrificing partner invited her to dance that his pleasure was cheapened and diminished she had even grown used to noticing anna joggle the reluctant jimmy with her elbow as a signal for him to invite her chum to walk over his feet through a two step but to night the pumpkin had turned to a coach and six terry o sullivan was a victorious prince charming and maggie toole winged her first butterfly flight and though our tropes of fairyland be mixed with those of entomology they shall not spill one drop of ambrosia from the rose crowned melody of maggie s one perfect night the girls besieged her for introductions to her fellow the clover leaf young men after two years of blindness suddenly perceived charms in miss toole they flexed their compelling muscles before her and bespoke her for the dance thus she scored but to terry o sullivan the honours of the evening fell thick and fast he shook his curls he smiled and went easily through the seven motions for acquiring grace in your own room before an open window ten minutes each day he danced like a faun he introduced manner and style and atmosphere his words came trippingly upon his tongue and he waltzed twice in succession with the paper box girl that dempsey donovan brought dempsey was the leader of the association he wore a dress suit and could chin the bar twice with one hand he was one of big mike o sullivan s lieutenants and was never troubled by trouble no cop dared to arrest him whenever be broke a pushcart man s head or shot a member of the heinrick b sweeney outing and literary association in the kneecap an officer would drop around and say the cap n d like to see ye a few minutes round to the office whin ye have time dempsey me boy but there would be sundry gentlemen there with large gold fob chains and black cigars and somebody would tell a funny story and then dempsey would go back and work half an hour with the sixpound dumbbells so doing a tight rope act on a wire stretched across niagara was a safe terpsichorean performance compared with waltzing twice with dempsey donovan s paper box girl at o clock the jolly round face of big mike o sullivan shone at the door for five minutes upon the scene he always looked in for five minutes smiled at the girls and handed out real perfectos to the delighted boys dempsey donovan was at his elbow instantly talking rapidly big mike looked carefully at the dancers smiled shook his head and departed the music stopped the dancers scattered to the chairs along the walls terry o sullivan with his entrancing bow relinquished a pretty girl in blue to her partner and started back to find maggie dempsey intercepted him in the middle of the floor some fine instinct that rome must have bequeathed to us caused nearly every one to turn and look at them there was a subtle feeling that two gladiators had met in the arena two or three give and takes with tight coat sleeves drew nearer one moment mr o sullivan said dempsey i hope you re enjoying yourself where did you say you live the two gladiators were well matched dempsey had perhaps ten pounds of weight to give away the o sullivan had breadth with quickness dempsey had a glacial eye a dominating slit of a mouth an indestructible jaw a complexion like a belle s and the coolness of a champion the visitor showed more fire in his contempt and less control over his conspicuous sneer they were enemies by the law written when the rocks were molten they were each too splendid too mighty too incomparable to divide pre eminence one only must survive i live on grand said o sullivan insolently and no trouble to find me at home where do you live dempsey ignored the question you say your name s o sullivan he went on well big mike says he never saw you before lots of things he never saw said the favourite of the hop as a rule went on dempsey huskily sweet o sullivans in this district know one another you escorted one of our lady members here and we want chance to make good if you ve got a family tree let s see a few historical o sullivan buds come out on it or do you want us to dig it out of you by the roots suppose you mind your own business suggested o sullivan blandly dempsey s eye brightened he held up an inspired forefinger as though a brilliant idea had struck him i ve got it now he said cordially it was just a little mistake you ain t no o sullivan you are a ring tailed monkey excuse us for not recognising you at first o sullivan s eye flashed he made a quick movement but andy geoghan was ready and caught his arm dempsey nodded at andy and william mcmahan the secretary of the club and walked rapidly toward a door at the rear of the hall two other members of the give and take association swiftly joined the little group terry o sullivan was now in the hands of the board of rules and social referees they spoke to him briefly and softly and conducted him out through the same door at the rear this movement on the part of the clover leaf members requires a word of elucidation back of the association hall was a smaller room rented by the club in this room personal difficulties that arose on the ballroom floor were settled man to man with the weapons of nature under the supervision of the board no lady could say that she had witnessed a fight at a clover leaf hop in several years its gentlemen members guaranteed that so easily and smoothly had dempsey and the board done their preliminary work that many in the hall had not noticed the checking of the fascinating o sullivan s social triumph among these was maggie she looked about for her escort smoke up said rose cassidy wasn t you on demps donovan picked a scrap with your lizzie boy and they ve waltzed out to the slaughter room with him how s my hair look done up this way mag maggie laid a hand on the bosom of her cheesecloth waist gone to fight with dempsey she said breathlessly they ve got to be stopped dempsey donovan can t fight him why he ll he ll kill him ah what do you care said rosa don t some of em fight every hop but maggie was off darting her zig zag way through the maze of dancers she burst through the rear door into the dark hall and then threw her solid shoulder against the door of the room of single combat it gave way and in the instant that she entered her eye caught the scene the board standing about with open watches dempsey donovan in his shirt sleeves dancing light footed with the wary grace of the modern pugilist within easy reach of his adversary terry o sullivan standing with arms folded and a murderous look in his dark eyes and without slacking the speed of her entrance she leaped forward with a scream leaped in time to catch and hang upon the arm of o sullivan that was suddenly uplifted and to whisk from it the long bright stiletto that he had drawn from his bosom the knife fell and rang upon the floor cold steel drawn in the rooms of the give and take association such a thing had never happened before every one stood motionless for a minute andy geoghan kicked the stiletto with the toe of his shoe curiously like an antiquarian who has come upon some ancient weapon unknown to his learning and then o sullivan hissed something unintelligible between his teeth dempsey and the board exchanged looks and then dempsey looked at o sullivan without anger as one looks at a stray dog and nodded his head in the direction of the door the back stairs giuseppi he said briefly somebody pitch your hat down after you maggie walked up to dempsey donovan there was a brilliant spot of red in her cheeks down which slow tears were running but she looked him bravely in the eye i knew it dempsey she said as her eyes grew dull even in their tears i knew he was a guinea his name s tony spinelli i hurried in when they told me you and him was scrappin them guineas always carries knives but you don t understand dempsey i never had a fellow in my life i got tired of comin with anna and jimmy every night so i fixed it with him to call himself o sullivan and brought him along i knew there d be nothin doin for him if he came as a dago i guess i ll resign from the club now dempsey turned to andy geoghan chuck that cheese slicer out of the window he said and tell em inside that mr o sullivan has had a telephone message to go down to tammany hall and then he turned back to maggie say mag he said i ll see you home and how about next saturday night will you come to the hop with me if i call around for you it was remarkable how quickly maggie s eyes could change from dull to a shining brown with you dempsey she stammered say will a duck swim man about town there were two or three things that i wanted to know i do not care about a mystery so i began to inquire it took me two weeks to find out what women carry in dress suit cases and then i began to ask why a mattress is made in two pieces this serious query was at first received with suspicion because it sounded like a conundrum i was at last assured that its double form of construction was designed to make lighter the burden of woman who makes up beds i was so foolish as to persist begging to know why then they were not made in two equal pieces whereupon i was shunned the third draught that i craved from the fount of knowledge was enlightenment concerning the character known as a man about town he was more vague in my mind than a type should be we must have a concrete idea of anything even if it be an imaginary idea before we can comprehend it now i have a mental picture of john doe that is as clear as a steel engraving his eyes are weak blue he wears a brown vest and a shiny black serge coat he stands always in the sunshine chewing something and he keeps half shutting his pocket knife and opening it again with his thumb and if the man higher up is ever found take my assurance for it he will be a large pale man with blue wristlets showing under his cuffs and he will be sitting to have his shoes polisbed within sound of a bowling alley and there will be somewhere about him turquoises but the canvas of my imagination when it came to limning the man about town was blank i fancied that he bad a detachable sneer like the smile of the cheshire cat and attached cuffs and that was all whereupon i asked a newspaper reporter about him why said he a man about town something between a rounder and a clubman he isn t exactly well he fits in between mrs fish s receptions and private boxing bouts he doesn t well he doesn t belong either to the lotos club or to the jerry mcgeogheghan galvanised iron workers apprentices left hook chowder association i don t exactly know how to describe him to you you ll see him everywhere there s anything doing yes i suppose he s a type dress clothes every evening knows the ropes calls every policeman and waiter in town by their first names no he never travels with the hydrogen derivatives you generally see him alone or with another man my friend the reporter left me and i wandered further afield by this time the electric lights on the rialto were alight people passed but they held me not paphian eyes rayed upon me and left me unscathed diners heimgangers shop girls confidence men panhandlers actors highwaymen millionaires and outlanders hurried skipped strolled sneaked swaggered and scurried by me but i took no note of them i knew them all i had read their hearts they had served i wanted my man about town he was a type and to drop him would be an error a typograph but no let us continue let us continue with a moral digression to see a family reading the sunday paper gratifies the sections have been separated papa is earnestly scanning the page that pictures the young lady exercising before an open window and bending but there there mamma is interested in trying to guess the missing letters in the word nw yok the oldest girls are eagerly perusing the financial reports for a certain young man remarked last sunday night that he had taken a flyer in q x z willie the eighteen year old son who attends the new york public school is absorbed in the weekly article describing how to make over an old skirt for he hopes to take a prize in sewing on graduation day grandma is holding to the comic supplement with a two hours grip and little tottie the baby is rocking along the best she can with the real estatc transfers this view is intended to be reassuring for it is desirable that a few lines of this story be skipped for it introduces strong drink i went into a cafe to and while it was being mixed i asked the man who grabs up your hot scotch spoon as soon as you lay it down what he undcrstood by the term epithet description designation characterisation or appellation viz a man about town why said he carefully it means a fly guy that s wise to the all night push see it s a hot sport that you can t bump to the rail anywhere between the flatirons see i guess that s about what it means i thanked him and departed on the sidewalk a salvation lassie shook her contribution receptacle gently against my waistcoat pocket would you mind telling me i asked her if you ever meet with the character commonly denominated as a man about town during your daily wanderings i think i know whom you mean she answered with a gentle smile we see them in the same places night after night they are the devil s body guard and if the soldiers of any army are as faithful as they are their commanders are well served we go among them diverting a few pennies from their wickedness to the lord s service she shook the box again and i dropped a dime into it in front of a glittering hotel a friend of mine a critic was climbing from a cab he seemed at leisure and i put my question to him he answered me conscientiously as i was sure he would there is a type of man about town in new york he answered the term is quite familiar to me but i don t think i was ever called upon to define the character before it would be difficult to point you out an exact specimen i would say offhand that it is a man who had a hopeless case of the peculiar new york disease of wanting to see and know at o clock each day life begins with him he follows rigidly the conventions of dress and manners but in the business of poking his nose into places where he does not belong he could give pointers to a civet cat or a jackdaw he is the man who has chased bohemia about the town from rathskeller to roof garden and from hester street to harlem until you can t find a place in the city where they don t cut their spaghetti with a knife your man about town has done that he is always on the scent of something new he is curiosity impudence and omnipresence hansoms were made for him and gold banded cigars and the curse of music at dinner there are not so many of him but his minority report is adopted everywhere i m glad you brought up the subject i ve felt the influence of this nocturnal blight upon our city but i never thought to analyse it before i can see now that your man about town should havc been classified long ago in his wake spring up wine agents and cloak models and the orchestra p ays let s all go up to maud s for him by request instead of handel he makes his rounds every evening while you and i see the elephant once a week when the cigar store is raided he winks at the officer familiar with his ground and walks away immune while you and i search among the presidents for names and among the stars for addresses to give the desk sergeant my friend the critic paused to acquire breath for fresh eloquence i seized my advantage you have classified him i cried with joy you have painted his portrait in the gallery of city types but i must meet one face to face i must study the man about town at first hand where shall i find him how shall i know him without seeming to hear me the critic went on and his cab driver was waiting for his fare too he is the sublimated essence of butt in the refined intrinsic extract of rubber the concentrated purified irrefutable unavoidable spirit of curiosity and inquisitiveness a new sensation is the breath in his nostrils when his experience is exhausted he explores new fields with the indefatigability of a excuse me i interrupted but can you produce one of this type it is a new thing to me i must study it i will search the town over until i find one its habitat must be here on broadway i am about to dine here said my friend come inside and if there is a man about town present i will point him out to you i know most of the regular patrons here i am not dining yet i said to him you will excuse me i am going to find my man about town this night if i have to rake new york from the battery to little coney island i left the hotel and walked down broadway the pursuit of my type gave a pleasant savour of life and interest to the air i breathed i was glad to be in a city so great so complex and diversified leisurely and with something of an air i strolled along with my heart expanding at the thought that i was a citizen of great gotham a sharer in its magnificence and pleasures a partaker in its glory and prestige i turned to cross the street i heard something buzz like a bee and then i took a long pleasant ride with santos dumont when i opened my eyes i remembered a smell of gasoline and i said aloud hasn t it passed yet a hospital nurse laid a hand that was not particularly soft upon my brow that was not at all fevered a young doctor came along grinned and handed me a morning newspaper want to see how it happened he asked cheerily i read the article its headlines began where i heard the buzzing leave off the night before it closed with these lines bellevue hospital where it was said that his injuries were not serious he appeared to be a typica man about town the cop and the anthem on his bench in madison square soapy moved uneasily when wild geese honk high of nights and when women without sealskin coats grow kind to their husbands and when soapy moves uneasily on his bench in the park you may know that winter is near at hand a dead leaf fell in soapy s lap that was jack frost s card jack is kind to the regular denizens of madison square and gives fair warning of his annual call at the corners of four streets he hands his pasteboard to the north wind footman of the mansion of all outdoors so that the inhabitants thereof may make ready soapy s mind became cognisant of the fact that the time had come for him to resolve himself into a singular committee of ways and means to provide against the coming rigour and therefore he moved uneasily on his bench the hibernatorial ambitions of soapy were not of the highest in them there were no considerations of mediterranean cruises of soporific southern skies drifting in the vesuvian bay three months on the island was what his soul craved three months of assured board and bed and congenial company safe from boreas and bluecoats seemed to soapy the essence of things desirable for years the hospitable blackwell s had been his winter quarters just as his more fortunate fellow new yorkers had bought their tickets to palm beach and the riviera each winter so soapy had made his humble arrangements for his annual hegira to the island and now the time was come on the previous night three sabbath newspapers distributed beneath his coat about his ankles and over his lap had failed to repulse the cold as he slept on his bench near the spurting fountain in the ancient square so the island loomed big and timely in soapy s mind he scorned the provisions made in the name of charity for the city s dependents in soapy s opinion the law was more benign than philanthropy there was an endless round of institutions municipal and eleemosynary on which he might set out and receive lodging and food accordant with the simple life but to one of soapy s proud spirit the gifts of charity are encumbered if not in coin you must pay in humiliation of spirit for every benefit received at the hands of philanthropy as caesar had his brutus every bed of charity must have its toll of a bath every loaf of bread its compensation of a private and personal inquisition wherefore it is better to be a guest of the law which though conducted by rules does not meddle unduly with a gentleman s private affairs soapy having decided to go to the island at once set about accomplishing his desire there were many easy ways of doing this the pleasantest was to dine luxuriously at some expensive restaurant and then after declaring insolvency be handed over quietly and without uproar to a policeman an accommodating magistrate would do the rest soapy left his bench and strolled out of the square and across the level sea of asphalt where broadway and fifth avenue flow together up broadway he turned and halted at a glittering cafe where are gathered together nightly the choicest products of the grape the silkworm and the protoplasm soapy had confidence in himself from the lowest button of his vest upward he was shaven and his coat was decent and his neat black ready tied four in hand had been presented to him by a lady missionary on thanksgiving day if he could reach a table in the restaurant unsuspected success would be his the portion of him that would show above the table would raise no doubt in the waiter s mind a roasted mallard duck thought soapy would be about the thing with a bottle of chablis and then camembert a demi tasse and a cigar one dollar for the cigar would be enough the total would not be so high as to call forth any supreme manifestation of revenge from the cafe management and yet the meat would leave him filled and happy for the journey to his winter refuge but as soapy set foot inside the restaurant door the head waiter s eye fell upon his frayed trousers and decadent shoes strong and ready hands turned him about and conveyed him in silence and haste to the sidewalk and averted the ignoble fate of the menaced mallard soapy turned off broadway it seemed that his route to the coveted island was not to be an epicurean one some other way of entering limbo must be thought of at a corner of sixth avenue electric lights and cunningly displayed wares behind plate glass made a shop window conspicuous soapy took a cobblestone and dashed it through the glass people came running around the corner a policeman in the lead soapy stood still with his hands in his pockets and smiled at the sight of brass buttons where s the man that done that inquired the officer excitedly don t you figure out that i might have had something to do with it said soapy not without sarcasm but friendly as one greets good fortune the policeman s mind refused to accept soapy even as a clue men who smash windows do not remain to parley with the law s minions they take to their heels the policeman saw a man half way down the block running to catch a car with drawn club he joined in the pursuit soapy with disgust in his heart loafed along twice unsuccessful on the opposite side of the street was a restaurant of no great pretensions it catered to large appetites and modest purses its crockery and atmosphere were thick its soup and napery thin into this place soapy took his accusive shoes and telltale trousers without challenge at a table he sat and consumed beefsteak flapjacks doughnuts and pie and then to the waiter be betrayed the fact that the minutest coin and himself were strangers now get busy and call a cop said soapy and don t keep a gentleman waiting no cop for youse said the waiter with a voice like butter cakes and an eye like the cherry in a manhattan cocktail hey con neatly upon his left ear on the callous pavement two waiters pitched soapy he arose joint by joint as a carpenter s rule opens and beat the dust from his clothes arrest seemed but a rosy dream the island seemed very far away a policeman who stood before a drug store two doors away laughed and walked down the street five blocks soapy travelled before his courage permitted him to woo capture again this time the opportunity presented what he fatuously termed to himself a cinch a young woman of a modest and pleasing guise was standing before a show window gazing with sprightly interest at its display of shaving mugs and inkstands and two yards from the window a large policeman of severe demeanour leaned against a water plug it was soapy s design to assume the role of the despicable and execrated masher the refined and elegant appearance of his victim and the contiguity of the conscientious cop encouraged him to believe that he would soon feel the pleasant official clutch upon his arm that would insure his winter quarters on the right little tight little isle soapy straightened the lady missionary s readymade tie dragged his shrinking cuffs into the open set his hat at a killing cant and sidled toward the young woman he made eyes at her was taken with sudden coughs and hems smiled smirked and went brazenly through the impudent and contemptible litany of the masher with half an eye soapy saw that the policeman was watching him fixedly the young woman moved away a few steps and again bestowed her absorbed attention upon the shaving mugs soapy followed boldly stepping to her side raised his hat and said ah there bedelia don t you want to come and play in my yard the policeman was still looking the persecuted young woman had but to beckon a finger and soapy would be practically en route for his insular haven already he imagined he could feel the cozy warmth of the station house the young woman faced him and stretching out a hand caught soapy s coat sleeve sure mike she said joyfully if you ll blow me to a pail of suds i d have spoke to you sooner but the cop was watching with the young woman playing the clinging ivy to his oak soapy walked past the policeman overcome with gloom he seemed doomed to liberty at the next corner he shook off his companion and ran he halted in the district where by night are found the lightest streets hearts vows and librettos women in furs and men in greatcoats moved gaily in the wintry air a sudden fear seized soapy that some dreadful enchantment had rendered him immune to arrest the thought brought a little of panic upon it and when he came upon another policeman lounging grandly in front of a transplendent theatre he caught at the immediate straw of disorderly conduct on the sidewalk soapy began to yell drunken gibberish at the top of his harsh voice he danced howled raved and otherwise disturbed the welkin the policeman twirled his club turned his back to soapy and remarked to a citizen tis one of them yale lads celebratin the goose egg they give to the hartford college noisy but no harm we ve instructions to lave them be disconsolate soapy ceased his unavailing racket would never a policeman lay hands on him in his fancy the island seemed an unattainable arcadia he buttoned his thin coat against the chilling wind in a cigar store he saw a well dressed man lighting a cigar at a swinging light his silk umbrella he had set by the door on entering soapy stepped inside secured the umbrella and sauntered off with it slowly the man at the cigar light followed hastily my umbrella he said sternly oh is it sneered soapy adding insult to petit larceny well why don t you call a policeman i took it your umbrella why don t you call a cop there stands one on the corner the umbrella owner slowed his steps soapy did likewise with a presentiment that luck would again run against him the policeman looked at the two curiously of course said the umbrella man that is well you know how these mistakes occur i if it s your umbrella i hope you ll excuse me i picked it up this morning in a restaurant if you recognise it as yours why i hope you ll of course it s mine said soapy viciously the ex umbrella man retreated the policeman hurried to assist a tall blonde in an opera cloak across the street in front of a street car that was approaching two blocks away soapy walked eastward through a street damaged by improvements he hurled the umbrella wrathfully into an excavation he muttered against the men who wear helmets and carry clubs because he wanted to fall into their clutches they seemed to regard him as a king who could do no wrong at length soapy reached one of the avenues to the east where the glitter and turmoil was but faint he set his face down this toward madison square for the homing instinct survives even when the home is a park bench but on an unusually quiet corner soapy came to a standstill here was an old church quaint and rambling and gabled through one violet stained window a soft light glowed where no doubt the organist loitered over the keys making sure of his mastery of the coming sabbath anthem for there drifted out to soapy s ears sweet music that caught and held him transfixed against the convolutions of the iron fence the moon was above lustrous and serene vehicles and pedestrians were few

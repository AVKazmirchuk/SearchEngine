broth over the gas stove i ve been a bad girl sudie said johnsy something has made that last leaf stay there to show me how wicked i was it is a sin to want to die you may bring me a little broth now

you ll win and now i must see another case i have downstairs behrman his name is some kind of an artist i believe pneumonia too he is an old weak man and the attack is acute there is no hope for him but he goes to the hospital to day to be made more comfortable the next day the doctor said to sue she s out of danger you ve won nutrition and care now that s all and that afternoon sue came to the bed where johnsy lay contentedly knitting a very blue and very useless woolen shoulder scarf and put one arm around her pillows and all i have something to tell you white mouse she said mr behrman died of pneumonia to day in the hospital he was ill only two days the janitor found him on the morning of the first day in his room downstairs helpless with pain his shoes and clothing were wet through and icy cold they couldn t imagine where he had been on such a dreadful night and then they found a lantern still lighted and a ladder that had been dragged from its place and some scattered brushes and a palette with green and yellow colors mixed on it and look out the window dear at the last ivy leaf on the wall didn t you wonder why it never fluttered or moved when the wind blew ah darling it s behrman s masterpiece he painted it there the night that the last leaf fell the count and the wedding guest one evening when andy donovan went to dinner at his second avenue boarding house mrs scott introduced him to a new boarder a young lady miss conway miss conway was small and unobtrusive she wore a plain snuffy brown dress and bestowed her interest which seemed languid upon her plate she lifted her diffident eyelids and shot one perspicuous judicial glance at mr donovan politely murmured his name and returned to her mutton mr donovan bowed with the grace and beaming smile that were rapidly winning for him social business and political advancement and erased the snuffy brown one from the tablets of his consideration two weeks later andy was sitting on the front steps enjoying his cigar there was a soft rustle behind and above him and andy turned his head and had his head turned just coming out the door was miss conway she wore a night black dress of crepe de crepe de oh this thin black goods her hat was black and from it drooped and fluttered an ebon veil filmy as a spider s web she stood on the top step and drew on black silk gloves not a speck of white or a spot of color about her dress anywhere her rich golden hair was drawn with scarcely a ripple into a shining smooth knot low on her neck her face was plain rather than pretty but it was now illuminated and made almost beautiful by her large gray eyes that gazed above the houses across the street into the sky with an expression of the most appealing sadness and melancholy gather the idea girls all black you know with the preference for crepe de oh crepe de chine that s it all black and that sad faraway look and the hair shining under the black veil you have to be a blonde of course and try to look as if although your young life had been blighted just as it was about to give a hop skip and a jump over the threshold of life a walk in the park might do you good and be sure to happen out the door at the right moment and oh it ll fetch em every time but it s fierce now how cynical i am ain t it to talk about mourning costumes this way mr donovan suddenly reinscribed miss conway upon the tablets of his consideration he threw away the remaining inch and a quarter of his cigar that would have been good for eight minutes yet and quickly shifted his center of gravity to his low cut patent leathers it s a fine clear evening miss conway he said and if the weather bureau could have heard the confident emphasis of his tones it would have hoisted the square white signal and nailed it to the mast to them that has the heart to enjoy it it is mr donovan said miss conway with a sigh mr donovan in his heart cursed fair weather heartless weather it should hail and blow and snow to be consonant with the mood of miss conway i hope none of your relatives i hope you haven t sustained a loss ventured mr donovan death has claimed said miss conway hesitating not a relative but one who but i will not intrude my brief upon you mr donovan intrude protested mr donovan why say miss conway i d be delighted that is i d be sorry i mean i m sure nobody could sympathize with you truer than i would miss conway smiled a little smile and oh it was sadder than her expression in repose laugh

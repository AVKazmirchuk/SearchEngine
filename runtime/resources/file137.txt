them out the front door very carefully and go upstairs to his little saint these visitors were generally conspirator like men with dark clothes and hats of course these dark things were noticed after a while and talked about dicky seemed to care nothing at all for the society of the alien residents of the town he avoided goodwin and his skilful escape from the trepanning story of doctor gregg is still referred to in coralio as a masterpiece of lightning diplomacy many letters arrived addressed to mr dicky maloney or senor dickee maloney to the considerable pride of pasa that so many people should desire to write to him only confirmed her own suspicion that the light from his red head shone around the world as to their contents she never felt curiosity there was a wife to you the one mistake dicky made in coralio was to run out of money at the wrong time where his money came from was a puzzle for the sales of his shop were next to nothing but that source failed and at a peculiarly unfortunate time it was when the comandante don senor el coronel encarnacion rios looked upon the little saint seated in the shop and felt his heart go pitapat the comandante who was versed in all the intricate art of gallantry first delicately hinted at his sentiments by donning his dress uniform and strutting up and down fiercely before her window pasa glancing demurely with her saintly eyes instantly perceived his resemblance to her parrot chichi and was diverted to the extent of smile the comandante saw the smile which was not intended for him convinced of an impression made he entered the shop confidently and advanced to open compliment pasa froze he pranced she flamed royally he was charmed to injudicious persistence she commanded him to leave the shop he tried to capture her hand and dicky entered smiling broadly full of white wine and the devil he spent five minutes in punishing the comandante scientifically and carefully so that the pain might be prolonged as far as possible at the end of that time he pitched the rash wooer out the door upon the stones of the street senseless a barefooted policeman who had been watching the affair from across the street blew a whistle a squad of four soldiers came running from the cuartel around the corner when they saw that the offender was dicky they stopped and blew more whistles which brought out reinforcements of eight deeming the odds against them sufficiently reduced the military advanced upon the disturber dicky being thoroughly imbued with the martial spirit stooped and drew the comandante s sword which was girded about him and charged his foe he chased the standing army four squares playfully prodding its squealing rear and hacking at its ginger colored heels but he was not so successful with the civic authorities six muscular nimble policemen overpowered him and conveyed him triumphantly but warily to jail el diablo colorado they dubbed him and derided the military for its defeat dicky with the rest of the prisoners could look out through the barred door at the grass of the little plaza at a row of orange trees and the red tile roofs and dobe walls of a line of insignificant stores at sunset along a path across this plaza came a melancholy procession of sad faced women bearing plantains cassava bread and fruit each coming with food to some wretch behind those bars to whom she still clung and furnished the means of life twice a day morning and evening they were permitted to come water was furnished to her compulsory guests by the republic but no food that evening dicky s name was called by the sentry and he stepped before the bars of the door there stood his little saint a black mantilla draped about her head and shoulders her face like glorified melancholy her clear eyes gazing longingly at him as if they might draw him between the bars to her she brought a chicken some oranges dulces and a loaf of white bread a soldier inspected the food and passed it in to dicky pasa spoke calmly as she always did briefly in her thrilling flute like tones angel of my life she said let it not be long that thou art away from me thou knowest that life is not a thing to be endured with thou not at my side tell me if i can do aught in this matter if not i will wait a little while i come again in the morning dicky with his shoes removed so as not to disturb his fellow prisoners tramped the floor of the jail half the night condemning his lack of money and the cause of it whatever that might have been he knew very well that money would have brought his release at once for two days succeeding pasa came at the appointed times and brought him food he eagerly inquired each time if a letter or package had come for him and she mournfully shook her head on the morning of the third day she brought only a small loaf of bread there were dark circles under her eyes she seemed as calm as ever by jingo said dicky who seemed to speak in english or spanish as the whim seized him this is dry provender muchachita is this the best you can dig up for a fellow pasa looked at him as a mother looks at a beloved but capricious babe think better of it she said in a low voice since for the next meal there will be nothing the last centavo is spent she pressed closer against the grating sell the goods in the shop take anything for them have i not tried did i not offer them for one tenth their cost not even one peso would any one give there is not one

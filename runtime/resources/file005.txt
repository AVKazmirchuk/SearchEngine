again from over the hills and far away in the morning the capable revolvered youth and his vaqueros set forth driving the bunch of sussex cattle across the prairies to the rancho seco ninety miles it was a six days journey grazing and watering the animals on the way the beasts arrived at rancho seco one evening at dusk and were received and counted by the foreman of the ranch the next morning at eight o clock a horseman loped out of the brush to the nopalito ranch house he dismounted stiffly and strode with whizzing spurs to the house his horse gave a great sigh and swayed foam streaked with down drooping head and closed eyes but waste not your pity upon belshazzar the flea bitten sorrel to day in nopalito horse pasture he survives pampered beloved unridden cherished record holder of long distance rides the horseman stumbled into the house two arms fell around his neck and someone cried out in the voice of woman and queen alike webb oh webb i was a skunk said webb yeager hush said santa did you see it i saw it said webb what they meant god knows and you shall know if you rightly read the primer of events be the cattle queen said webb and overlook it if you can i was a mangy sheep stealing coyote hush said santa again laying her fingers upon his mouth there s no queen here do you know who i am i am santa yeager first lady of the bedchamber come here she dragged him from the gallery into the room to the right there stood a cradle with an infant in it a red ribald unintelligible babbling beautiful infant sputtering at life in an unseemly manner there s no queen on this ranch said santa again look at the king he s got your eyes webb down on your knees and look at his highness but jingling rowels sounded on the gallery and bud turner stumbled there again with the same query that he had brought lacking a few days a year ago morning them beeves is just turned out on the trail shall i drive em to barber s or he saw webb and stopped open mouthed ba ba ba ba ba ba shrieked the king in his cradle beating the air with his fists you hear your boss bud said webb yeager with a broad grin just as he had said a year ago and that is all except that when old man quinn owner of the rancho seco went out to look over the herd of sussex cattle that he had bought from the nopalito ranch he asked his new manager what s the nopalito ranch brand wilson x bar y said wilson i thought so said quinn but look at that white heifer there she s got another brand a heart with a cross inside of it what brand is that the ransom of mack me and old mack lonsbury we got out of that little hide and seek gold mine affair with about apiece i say old mack but he wasn t old forty one i should say but he always seemed old andy he says to me i m tired of hustling you and me have been working hard together for three years say we knock off for a while and spend some of this idle money we ve coaxed our way the proposition hits me just right says i let s be nabobs for a while and see how it feels what ll we do take in the niagara falls or buck at faro for a good many years says mack i ve thought that if i ever had extravagant money i d rent a two room cabin somewhere hire a

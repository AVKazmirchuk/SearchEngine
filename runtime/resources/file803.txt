readers that is the editor s theory and this is the way he carries it out when a batch of mss is received the editor stuffs every one of his pockets full of them and distributes them as he goes about during the day the office employees the hall porter the janitor the elevator man messenger boys the waiters at the caf where the editor has luncheon the man at the news stand where he buys his evening paper the grocer and milkman the guard on the uptown elevated train the ticket chopper at sixty th street the cook and maid at his home these are the readers who pass upon mss sent in to the hearthstone magazine if his pockets are not entirely emptied by the time he reaches the bosom of his family the remaining ones are handed over to his wife to read after the baby goes to sleep a few days later the editor gathers in the mss during his regular rounds and con siders the verdict of his assorted readers this system of making up a magazine has been very successful and the circulation paced by the advertising rates is making a wonderful record of speed the hearthstone company also publishes books and its imprint is to be found on several successful works all recommended says the editor by the hearthstone army of volunteer readers now and then according to talkative members of the editorial staff the hearthstone has allowed manuscripts to slip through its fingers on the advice of its heterogeneous readers that afterward proved to be famous sellers when brought out by other houses for instance the gossips say the rise and fall of silas latham was unfavourably passed upon by the elevator man the office boy unanimously rejected the boss in the bishop s carriage was contemptuously looked upon by the street car conductor the deliver ance was turned down by a clerk in the subscription department whose wife s mother had just begun a two months visit at his home the queen s quair came back from the janitor with the comment so is the book but nevertheless the hearthstone adheres to its theory and system and it will never lack volunteer readers for each one of the widely scattered staff from the young lady stenographer in the editorial office to the man who shovels in coal whose adverse decision lost to the hearth stone company the manuscript of the under world has expectations of becoming editor of the magazine some day this method of the hearthstone was well known to allen slayton when he wrote his novelette entitled love is all slayton had hung about the editorial offices of all the magazines so persistently that he was acquainted with the inner workings of every one in gotham he knew not only that the editor of the hearthstone handed his mss around among different types of people for reading but that the stories of sentimental love interest went to miss puffkin the editor s stenographer another of the editor s peculiar customs was to conceal invariably the name of the writer from his readers of mss so that a glittering name might not influence the sincerity of their reports slayton made love is all the effort of his life he gave it six months of the best work of his heart and brain it was a pure love story fine elevated romantic passionate a prose poem that set the divine blessing of love i am transposing from the manuscript high above all earthly gifts and honours and listed it in the catalogue of heaven s choicest rewards slayton s literary ambition was intense he would have sacrificed all other worldly possessions to have gained fame in his chosen art he would almost have cut off his right hand or have offered himself to the knife of the appendi citis fancier to have realized his dream of seeing one of his efforts published in the hearthstone slayton finished love is all and took it to thy hearthstone in person the office of the magazine was in a large conglomerate building presided under by a janitor as the writer stepped inside the door on his way to the elevator a potato masher flew through the hall wreck ing slayton s hat and smashing the glass of the door closely following in the wake of the utensil flew the janitor a bulky unwholesome man suspenderless and sordid panic stricken and breathless a frowsy tall woman with flying hair followed the missile the janitor s foot slipped on the tiled floor he fell in a heap with an exclamation of despair the woman pounced upon him and seized his hair the man

fanciful paths of memory he smiled to himself as a paraphrased line of scripture strayed into his mind a certain poor man made a feast he heard the sound of absalom coughing a note of summons grandemont stirred this time he had not been asleep only drowsing nine o clock m shi grande said absalom in the uninflected voice of a good servant who states a fact unqualified by personal opinion grandemont rose to his feet in their time all the charleses had been proven and they were gallant losers serve dinner he said calmly and then he checked absalom s movement to obey for something clicked the gate latch and was coming down the walk toward the house something that shuffled its feet and muttered to itself as it came it stopped in the current of light at the foot of the steps and spake in the universal whine of the gadding mendicant kind sir could you spare a poor hungry man out of luck a little to eat and to sleep in the corner of a shed for the thing concluded irrelevantly i can sleep now there are no mountains to dance reels in the night and the copper kettles are all scoured bright the iron band is still round my ankle and a link if it is your desire i should be chained it set a foot upon the step and drew up the rags that hung upon the limb above the distorted shoe caked with the dust of a hundred leagues they saw the link and the iron band the clothes of the tramp were wreaked to piebald tatters by sun and rain and wear a mat of brown tangled hair and beard covered his head and face out of which his eyes stared distractedly grandemont noticed that he carried in one hand a white square card what is that he asked i picked it up sir at the side of the road the vagabond handed the card to grandemont just a little to eat sir a little parched corn a tortilla or a handful of beans goat s meat i cannot eat when i cut their throats they cry like children grandemont held up the card it was one of his own invitations to dinner no doubt some one had cast it away from a passing carriage after comparing it with the tenantless house of charleroi from the hedges and highways bid them come he said to himself softly smiling and then to absalom send louis to me louis once his own body servant came promptly in his white jacket this gentleman said grandemont will dine with me furnish him with bath and clothes in twenty minutes have him ready and dinner served louis approached the disreputable guest with the suavity due to a visitor to charleroi and spirited him away to inner regions promptly in twenty minutes absalom announced dinner and a moment later the guest was ushered into the dining hall where grandemont waited standing at the head of the table the attentions of louis had transformed the stranger into something resembling the polite animal clean linen and an old evening suit that had been sent down from town to clothe a waiter had worked a miracle with his exterior brush and comb had partially subdued the wild disorder of his hair now he might have passed for no more extravagant a thing than one of those poseurs in art and music who affect such oddity of guise the man s countenance and demeanour as he approached the table exhibited nothing of the awkwardness or confusion to be expected from his arabian nights change he allowed absalom to seat him at grandemont s right hand with the manner of one thus accustomed to be waited upon it grieves me said grandemont to be obliged to exchange names with a guest my own name is charles in the mountains said the wayfarer they call me gringo along the roads they call me jack i prefer the latter said grandemont a glass of wine with you mr jack course after course was served by the supernumerous waiters grandemont inspired by the results of andre s exquisite skill in cookery and his own in the selection of wines became the model host talkative witty and genial the guest was fitful in conversation his mind seemed to be sustaining a seccession of waves of dementia followed by intervals of comparative lucidity there was the glassy brightness of recent fever in his eyes a long course of it must have been the cause of his emaciation and weakness his distracted mind and the dull pallor that showed even through the tan of wind and sun charles he said to grandemont for thus he seemed to interpret his name you never saw the mountains dance did you no mr jack answered grandemont gravely the spectacle has been denied me but i assure you i can understand it must be a diverting sight the big ones you know white with snow on the tops waltzing decollete we may say you first scour the kettles said mr jack leaning toward him excitedly to cook the beans in the morning and you lie down on a blanket and keep quite still then they come out and dance for you you would go out and dance with them but you are chained every night to the centre pole of the hut you believe the mountains dance don t you charlie i contradict no traveller s tales said grandemont with a smile mr jack laughed loudly he dropped his voice to a confidential whisper you are a fool to believe it he went on they don t really advance it s the fever in your head it s the hard work and the bad water that does it you are sick for weeks and there is no medicine the fever comes on every evening and then you are as strong as two men one

and hugs you when he ain t jagged preserve me from the man that ain t got the sand to do neither mrs fink sighed the hallways were suddenly filled with sound the door flew open at the kick of mr cassidy his arms were occupied with bundles mame flew and hung about his neck her sound eye sparkled with the love light that shines in the eye of the maori maid when she recovers consciousness in the hut of the wooer who has stunned and dragged her there hello old girl shouted mr cassidy he shed his bundles and lifted her off her feet in a mighty hug i got tickets for barnum bailey s and if you ll bust the string of one of them bundles i guess you ll find that silk waist why good evening mrs fink i didn t see you at first how s old mart coming along he s very well mr cassidy thanks said mrs fink i must be going along up now mart ll be home for supper soon i ll bring you down that pattern you wanted to morrow mame mrs fink went up to her flat and had a little cry it was a meaningless cry the kind of cry that only a woman knows about a cry from no particular cause altogether an absurd cry the most transient and the most hopeless cry in the repertory of grief why had martin never thrashed her he was as big and strong as jack cassidy did he not care for her at all he never quarrelled he came home and lounged about silent glum idle he was a fairly good provider but he ignored the spices of life mrs fink s ship of dreams was becalmed her captain ranged between plum duff and his hammock if only he would shiver his timbers or stamp his foot on the quarter deck now and then and she had thought to sail so merrily touching at ports in the delectable isles but now to vary the figure she was ready to throw up the sponge tired out without a scratch to show for all those tame rounds with her sparring partner for one moment she almost hated mame mame with her cuts and bruises her salve of presents and kisses her stormy voyage with her fighting brutal loving mate mr fink came home at he was permeated with the curse of domesticity beyond the portals of his cozy home he cared not to roam to roam he was the man who had caught the street car the anaconda that had swallowed its prey the tree that lay as it had fallen like the supper mart asked mrs fink who had striven over it m m m yep grunted mr fink after supper he gathered his newspapers to read he sat in his stocking feet arise some new dante and sing me the befitting corner of perdition for the man who sitteth in the house in his stockinged feet sisters of patience who by reason of ties or duty have endured it in silk yarn cotton lisle thread or woollen does not the new canto belong the next day was labor day the occupations of mr cassidy and mr fink ceased for one passage of the sun labor triumphant would parade and otherwise disport itself mrs fink took mrs cassidy s pattern down early maine had on her new silk waist even her damaged eye managed to emit a holiday gleam jack was fruitfully penitent and there was a hilarious scheme for the day afoot with parks and picnics and pilsener in it a rising indignant jealousy seized mrs fink as she returned to her flat above oh happy mame with her bruises and her quick following balm but was mame to have a monopoly of happiness surely martin fink was as good a man as jack cassidy was his wife to go always unbelabored and uncaressed a sudden brilliant breathless idea came to mrs fink she would show mame that there were husbands as able to use their fists and perhaps to be as tender afterward as any jack the holiday promised to be a nominal one with the finks mrs fink had the stationary washtubs in the kitchen filled with a two weeks wash that had been soaking overnight mr fink sat in his stockinged feet reading a newspaper thus labor day presaged to speed jealousy surged high in mrs fink s heart and higher still surged an audacious resolve if her man would not strike her if he would not so far prove his manhood his prerogative and his interest in conjugal affairs he must be prompted to his duty mr fink lit his pipe and peacefully rubbed an ankle with a stockinged toe he reposed in the state of matrimony like a lump of unblended suet in a pudding this was his level elysium to sit at ease vicariously girdling the world in print amid the wifely splashing of suds and the agreeable smells of breakfast dishes departed and dinner ones to come many ideas were far from his mind but the furthest one was the thought of beating his wife mrs fink turned on the hot water and set the washboards in the suds up from the flat below came the gay laugh of mrs cassidy it sounded like a taunt a flaunting of her own happiness in the face of the unslugged bride above now was mrs fink s time suddenly she turned like a fury upon the man reading you lazy loafer she cried must i work my arms off washing and toiling for the ugly likes of you are you a man or are you a kitchen hound mr fink dropped his

stood the phantom i never burn a light at night so the room was quite dark but i saw it plainly i wasn t dreaming it was a tall man all misty white from head to foot it wore the full dress of the old colonial days powdered hair baggy coat skirts lace ruffles and a sword it looked intangible and luminous in the dark and moved without a sound yes i was a little frightened at first or startled i should say it was the first ghost i had ever seen no it didn t say anything i didn t scream i raised up on my elbow and then it glided silently away and disappeared when it reached the door mrs kinsolving was in the seventh heaven the description is that of captain kinsolving of general greene s army one of our ancestors she said in a voice that trembled with pride and relief i really think i must apologize for our ghostly relative mrs bellmore i am afraid he must have badly disturbed your rest terence sent a smile of pleased congratulation toward his mother attainment was mrs kinsolving s at last and he loved to see her happy i suppose i ought to be ashamed to confess said mrs bellmore who was now enjoying her breakfast that i wasn t very much disturbed i presume it would have been the customary thing to scream and faint and have all of you running about in picturesque costumes but after the first alarm was over i really couldn t work myself up to a panic the ghost retired from the stage quietly and peacefully after doing its little turn and i went to sleep again nearly all listened politely accepted mrs bellmore s story as a made up affair charitably offered as an offset to the unkind vision seen by mrs fischer suympkins but one or two present perceived that her assertions bore the genuine stamp of her own convictions truth and candour seemed to attend upon every word even a scoffer at ghosts if he were very observant would have been forced to admit that she had at least in a very vivid dream been honestly aware of the weird visitor soon mrs bellmore s maid was packing in two hours the auto would come to convey her to the station as terence was strolling upon the east piazza mrs bellmore came up to him with a confidential sparkle in her eye i didn t wish to tell the others all of it she said but i will tell you in a way i think you should be held responsible can you guess in what manner that ghost awakened me last night rattled chains suggested terence after some thought or groaned they usually do one or the other do you happen to know continued mrs bellmore with sudden irrelevancy if i resemble any one of the female relatives of your restless ancestor captain kinsolving don t think so said terence with an extremely puzzled air never heard of any of them being noted beauties then why said mrs bellmore looking the young man gravely in the eye should that ghost have kissed me as i m sure it did heavens exclaimed terence in wide eyed amazement you don t mean that mrs bellmore did he actually kiss you i said it corrected mrs bellmore i hope the impersonal pronoun is correctly used but why did you say i was responsible because you are the only living male relative of the ghost i see unto the third and fourth generation but seriously did he did it how do you know how does any one know i was asleep and that is what awakened me i m almost certain almost well i awoke just as oh can t you understand what i mean when anything arouses you suddenly you are not positive whether you dreamed or and yet you know that dear me terence must i dissect the most elementary sensations in order to accommodate your extremely practical intelligence but about kissing ghosts you know said terence humbly i require the most primary instruction i never kissed a ghost is it is it the sensation said mrs bellmore with deliberate but slightly smiling emphasis since you are seeking instruction is a mingling of the material and the spiritual of course said terence suddenly growing serious it was a dream or some kind of an hallucination nobody believes in spirits these days if you told the tale out of kindness of heart mrs bellmore i can t express how grateful i am to you it has made my mother supremely happy that revolutionary ancestor was a stunning idea mrs bellmore sighed the usual fate of ghost seers is mine she said resignedly my privileged encounter with a spirit is attributed to lobster salad or mendacity well i have at least one memory left from the wreck a kiss from the unseen world was captain kinsolving a very brave man do you know terence he was licked at yorktown i believe said terence reflecting they say he skedaddled with his company after the first battle there i thought he must have been timid said mrs bellmore absently he might have had another another battle asked terence dully what else could i mean i must go and get ready now the auto will be here in an hour i ve enjoyed clifftop immensely such a lovely morning isn t it terence on her way to the station mrs bellmore took from her bag a silk handkerchief and looked at it with a little peculiar smile then she tied it in several very hard knots and threw it at a convenient moment over the edge of the cliff along which the road ran in his room terence was giving some directions to his man brooks have this stuff done up in a parcel he said and ship it to the address on that card

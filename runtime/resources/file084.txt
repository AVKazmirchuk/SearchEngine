no mystery for goodwin he was the most successful of the small advance guard of speculative americans that had invaded anchuria and he had not reached that enviable pinnacle without having well exercised the arts of foresight and deduction he had taken up political intrigue as a matter of business he was acute enough to wield a certain influence among the leading schemers and he was prosperous enough to be able to purchase the respect of the petty officeholders there was always a revolutionary party and to it he had allied himself for the adherents of a new administration received the rewards of their labors there was now a liberal party seeking to overturn president miraflores if the wheel successfully revolved goodwin stood to win a concession to manzanas of the finest coffee lands in the interior certain incidents in the recent career of president miraflores had excited a shrewd suspicion in goodwin s mind that the government was near a dissolution from another cause than that of a revolution and now englehart s telegram had come as a corroboration of his wisdom the telegram which had remained unintelligible to the anchurian linguists who had applied to it in vain their knowledge of spanish and elemental english conveyed a stimulating piece of news to goodwin s understanding it informed him that the president of the republic had decamped from the capital city with the contents of the treasury furthermore that he was accompanied in his flight by that winning adventuress isabel guilbert the opera singer whose troupe of performers had been entertained by the president at san mateo during the past month on a scale less modest than that with which royal visitors are often content the reference to the jackrabbit line could mean nothing else than the mule back system of transport that prevailed between coralio and the capital the hint that the boodle was six figures short made the condition of the national treasury lamentably clear also it was convincingly true that the ingoing party its way now made a pacific one would need the spondulicks unless its pledges should be fulfilled and the spoils held for the delectation of the victors precarious indeed would be the position of the new government therefore it was exceeding necessary to collar the main guy and recapture the sinews of war and government goodwin handed the message to keogh read that billy he said it s from bob englehart can you manage the cipher keogh sat in the other half of the doorway and carefully perused the telegram tis not a cipher he said finally tis what they call literature and that s a system of language put in the mouths of people that they ve never been introduced to by writers of imagination the magazines invented it but i never knew before that president norvin green had stamped it with the seal of his approval tis now no longer literature but language the dictionaries tried but they couldn t make it go for anything but dialect sure now that the western union indorses it it won t be long till a race of people will spring up that speaks it you re running too much to philology billy said goodwin do you make out the meaning of it sure replied the philosopher of fortune all languages come easy to the man who must know em i ve even failed to misunderstand an order to evacuate in classical chinese when it was backed up by the muzzle of a breech loader this little literary essay i hold in my hands means a game of fox in the morning ever play that frank when you was a kid i think so said goodwin laughing you join hands all round and you do not interrupted keogh you ve got a fine sporting game mixed up in your head with all around the rosebush the spirit of fox in the morning is opposed to the holding of hands i ll tell you how it s played this president man and his companion in play they stand up over in san mateo ready for the run and shout fox in the morning me and you standing here we say goose and gander they say how many miles is it to london town we say only a few if your legs are long enough how many comes out they say more than you re able to catch and then the game commences i catch the idea said goodwin it won t do to let the goose and gander slip through your fingers billy their feathers are too valuable our crowd is prepared and able to step into the shoes of the government at once but with the treasury empty we d stay in power about as long as a tenderfoot would stick on an untamed bronco we must play the fox on every foot of the coast to prevent their getting out of the country by the mule back schedule said keogh it s five days down from san mateo we ve got plenty of time to set our outposts there s only three places on the coast where they can hope to sail from here and solitas and alazan they re the only points we ll have to guard it s as easy as a chess problem fox to play and mate in three moves oh goosey goosey gander whither do you wander by the blessing of the literary telegraph the boodle of this benighted fatherland shall be preserved to the honest political party that is seeking to overthrow it the situation had been justly outlined by keogh the down trail from the capital was at all times a weary road to travel a jiggety joggety journey it was ice cold and hot wet and dry the trail climbed appalling mountains wound like a rotten string about the brows of breathless precipices plunged through chilling snow fed streams and wriggled like a snake through sunless

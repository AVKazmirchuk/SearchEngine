the canvas for us some of the schemes that had caused his hair to evacuate he had one scheme for starting a national bank on that made the mississippi bubble look as solid as a glass marble he talked this to us for three days and when his throat was good and sore we told him about the roll we had atterbury borrowed a quarter from us and went out and got a box of throat lozenges and started all over again this time he talked bigger things and he got us to see em as he did the scheme he laid out looked like a sure winner and he talked me and buck into putting our capital against his burnished dome of thought it looked all right for a kid gloved graft it seemed to be just about an inch and a half outside of the reach of the police and as money making as a mint it was just what me and buck wanted a regular business at a permanent stand with an open air spieling with tonsilitis on the street corners every evening so in six weeks you see a handsome furnished set of offices down in the wall street neighborhood with the golconda gold bond and investment company in gilt letters on the door and you see in his private room with the door open the secretary and treasurer mr buckingham skinner costumed like the lilies of the conservatory with his high silk hat close to his hand nobody yet ever saw buck outside of an instantaneous reach for his hat and you might perceive the president and general manager mr r g atterbury with his priceless polished poll busy in the main office room dictating letters to a shorthand countess who has got pomp and a pompadour that is no less than a guarantee to investors there is a bookkeeper and an assistant and a general atmosphere of varnish and culpability at another desk the eye is relieved by the sight of an ordinary man attired with unscrupulous plainness sitting with his feet up eating apples with his obnoxious hat on the back of his head that man is no other than colonel tecumseh once parleyvoo pickens the vice president of the company no recherch rags for me i says to atterbury when we was organizing the stage properties of the robbery i m a plain man says i and i do not use pajamas french or military hair brushes cast me for the role of the rhinestone in the rough or i don t go on exhibition if you can use me in my natural though displeasing form do so dress you up says atterbury i should say not just as you are you re worth more to the business than a whole roomful of the things they pin chrysanthemums on you re to play the part of the solid but disheveled capitalist from the far west you despise the conventions you ve got so many stocks you can afford to shake socks conservative homely rough shrewd saving that s your pose it s a winner in new york keep your feet on the desk and eat apples whenever anybody comes in eat an apple let em see you stuff the peelings in a drawer of your desk look as economical and rich and rugged as you can i followed out atterbury s instructions i played the rocky mountain capitalist without ruching or frills the way i deposited apple peelings to my credit in a drawer when any customers came in made hetty green look like a spendthrift i could hear atterbury saying to victims as he smiled at me indulgent and venerating that s our vice president colonel pickens fortune in western investments delightfully plain manners but could sign his check for half a million simple as a child wonderful head conservative and careful almost to a fault atterbury managed the business me and buck never quite understood all of it though he explained it to us in full it seems the company was a kind of cooperative one and everybody that bought stock shared in the profits first we officers bought up a controlling interest we had to have that of the shares at cents a hundred just what the printer charged us and the rest went to the public at a dollar each the company guaranteed the stockholders a profit of ten per cent each month payable on the last day thereof when any stockholder had paid in as much as the company issued him a gold bond and he became a bondholder i asked atterbury one day what benefits and appurtenances these gold bonds was to an investor more so than the immunities and privileges enjoyed by the common sucker who only owned stock atterbury picked up one of them gold bonds all gilt and lettered up with flourishes and a big red seal tied with a blue ribbon in a bowknot and he looked at me like his feelings was hurt my dear colonel pickens says he you have no soul for art think of a thousand homes made happy by possessing one of these beautiful gems of the lithographer s skill think of the joy in the household where one of these gold bonds hangs by a pink cord to the what not or is chewed by the baby caroling gleefully upon the floor ah i see your eye growing moist colonel i have touched you have i not you have not says i for i ve been watching you the moisture you see is apple juice you can t expect one man to act as a human cider press and an art connoisseur too atterbury attended to the details of the concern as i understand it they was simple the investors in stock paid in their money and well i guess that s

your catskills there s more solid comfort in the borough of manhattan than in all the rest of the country together no siree no tramping up perpendicular cliffs and being waked up at in the morning by a million flies and eating canned goods straight from the city for me little old new york will take a few select summer boarders comforts and conveniences of homes that s the ad that i answer every time you need a vacation said the fat man looking closely at the other you haven t been away from town in years better come with me for two weeks anyhow the trout in the beaverkill are jumping at anything now that looks like a fly harding writes me that he landed a three pound brown last week nonsense cried the other man go ahead if you like and boggle around in rubber boots wearing yourself out trying to catch fish when i want one i go to a cool restaurant and order it i laugh at you fellows whenever i think of you hustling around in the heat in the country thinking you are having a good time for me father knickerbocker s little improved farm with the big shady lane running through the middle of it the fat man sighed over his friend and went his way the man who thought new york was the greatest summer resort in the country boarded a car and went buzzing down to his office on the way he threw away his newspaper and looked up at a ragged patch of sky above the housetops three pounds he muttered absently and harding isn t a liar i believe if i could but it s impossible they ve got to have another month another month at least in his office the upholder of urban midsummer joys dived headforemost into the swimming pool of business adkins his clerk came and added a spray of letters memoranda and telegrams at o clock in the afternoon the busy man leaned back in his office chair put his feet on the desk and mused aloud i wonder what kind of bait harding used she was all in white that day and thereby compton lost a bet to gaines compton had wagered she would wear light blue for she knew that was his favorite color and compton was a millionaire s son and that almost laid him open to the charge of betting on a sure thing but white was her choice and gaines held up his head with twenty five s lordly air the little summer hotel in the mountains had a lively crowd that year there were two or three young college men and a couple of artists and a young naval officer on one side on the other there were enough beauties among the young ladies for the correspondent of a society paper to refer to them as a bevy but the moon among the stars was mary sewell each one of the young men greatly desired to arrange matters so that he could pay her millinery bills and fix the furnace and have her do away with the sewell part of her name forever those who could stay only a week or two went away hinting at pistols and blighted hearts but compton stayed like the mountains themselves for he could afford it and gaines stayed because he was a fighter and wasn t afraid of millionaire s sons and well he adored the country what do you think miss mary he said once i knew a duffer in new york who claimed to like it in the summer time said you could keep cooler there than you could in the woods wasn t he an awful silly i don t think i could breathe on broadway after the st of june mamma was thinking of going back week after next said miss mary with a lovely frown but when you think of it said gaines there are lots of jolly places in town in the summer the roof gardens you know and the er the roof gardens deepest blue was the lake that day the day when they had the mock tournament and the men rode clumsy farm horses around in a glade in the woods and caught curtain rings on the end of a lance such fun cool and dry as the finest wine came the breath of the shadowed forest the valley below was a vision seen through an opal haze a white mist from hidden falls blurred the green of a hand s breadth of tree tops half way down the gorge youth made merry hand in hand with young summer nothing on broadway like that the villagers gathered to see the city folks pursue their mad drollery the woods rang with the laughter of pixies and naiads and sprites gaines caught most of the rings his was the privilege to crown the queen of the tournament he was the conquering knight as far as the rings went on his arm he wore a white scarf compton wore light blue she had declared her preference for blue but she wore white that day gaines looked about for the queen to crown her he heard her merry laugh as if from the clouds she had slipped away and climbed chimney rock a little granite bluff and stood there a white fairy among the laurels fifty feet above their heads instantly he and compton accepted the implied challenge the bluff was easily mounted at the rear but the front offered small hold to hand or foot each man quickly selected his route and began to climb a crevice a bush a slight projection a vine or tree branch all of these were aids that counted in the race it was all foolery there was no stake but there was youth in it cross reader and light hearts and something else that miss clay writes so charmingly about gaines gave a great tug at the root of a laurel and pulled himself to miss mary s feet on his arm he carried the wreath of roses and while the villagers and summer boarders screamed and applauded below he placed it on the queen s brow you are a gallant knight said miss mary if i could be your true knight always began gaines but miss mary laughed him dumb for compton scrambled over the edge of the rock one minute behind time what a twilight that was when they drove back to the hotel the opal of the valley turned slowly to purple the dark woods framed the lake as a mirror the tonic air stirred the very soul in one the first pale stars came out over the mountain tops where yet a faint glow of i beg your pardon mr gaines said adkins the man who believed new york to be the finest summer resort in the world opened his eyes and kicked over the mucilage bottle on his desk i i believe i was asleep he said it s the heat said adkins it s something awful in the city these nonsense said the other the city beats the country ten to one in summer fools go out tramping in muddy brooks and wear themselves out trying to catch little fish as long as your finger stay in town and keep comfortable that s my idea some letters just came said adkins i thought you might like to glance at them before you go let us look over his shoulder and read just a few lines of one of them my dear dear husband just received your letter ordering us to stay another month rita s cough is almost gone johnny has simply gone wild like a little indian will be the making of both children work so hard and i know that your business can hardly afford to keep us here so long best man that ever you always pretend that you like the city in summer trout fishing that you used to be so fond of and all to keep us well and happy come to you if it were not doing the babies so much good i stood last evening on chimney rock in exactly the same spot where i was when you put the wreath of roses on my head through all the world when you said you would be my true knight fifteen years ago dear just think have always been that to me ever and ever mary the man who said he thought new york the finest summer resort in the country dropped into a cafe on his way home and had a glass of beer under an electric fan wonder what kind of a fly old harding used he said to himself the last leaf in a little district west of washington square the streets have run crazy and broken themselves into small strips called places these places make strange angles and curves one street crosses itself a time or two an artist once discovered a valuable possibility in this street suppose a collector with a bill for paints paper and canvas should in traversing this route suddenly meet himself coming back without a cent having been paid on account so to quaint old greenwich village the art people soon came prowling hunting for north windows and eighteenth century gables and dutch attics and low rents then they imported some pewter mugs and a chafing dish or two from sixth avenue and became a colony at the top of a squatty three story brick sue and johnsy had their studio johnsy was familiar for joanna one was from maine the other from california they had met at the table d hote of an eighth street delmonico s and found their tastes in art chicory salad and bishop sleeves so congenial that the joint studio resulted that was in may in november a cold unseen stranger whom the doctors called pneumonia stalked about the colony touching one here and there with his icy fingers over on the east side this ravager strode boldly smiting his victims by scores but his feet trod slowly through the maze of the narrow and moss grown places mr pneumonia was not what you would call a chivalric old gentleman a mite of a little woman with blood thinned by california zephyrs was hardly fair game for the red fisted short breathed old duffer but johnsy he smote and she lay scarcely moving on her painted iron bedstead looking through the small dutch window panes at the blank side of the next brick house one morning the busy doctor invited sue into the hallway with a shaggy gray eyebrow she has one chance in let us say ten he said as he shook down the mercury in his clinical thermometer and that chance is for her to want to live this way people have of lining up on the side of the undertaker makes the entire pharmacopeia look silly your little lady has made up her mind that she s not going to get well has she anything on her mind she she wanted to paint the bay of naples some day said sue paint bosh has she anything on her mind worth thinking about twice a man for instance a man said sue with a jew s harp twang in her voice is a man worth but no doctor there is nothing of the kind well it is the weakness then said the doctor i will do all that science so far as it may filter through my efforts can accomplish but whenever my patient begins to count the carriages in her funeral procession i subtract per cent from the curative power of medicines if you will get her to ask one question about the new winter styles in cloak sleeves i will promise you a one in five chance for her instead of one in ten after the doctor had gone sue went into the workroom and cried a japanese napkin to a pulp then she swaggered into johnsy s room with her drawing board whistling ragtime johnsy lay scarcely making a ripple under the bedclothes with her face toward the window sue stopped whistling thinking she was asleep she arranged her board and began a pen and ink drawing to illustrate a magazine story young artists must pave their way to art by drawing pictures for magazine stories that young authors write to pave their way to literature as sue was sketching a pair of elegant horseshow riding trousers and a monocle on the figure of the hero an idaho cowboy she heard a low sound several times repeated she went quickly to the bedside johnsy s eyes were open wide she was looking out the window and counting counting backward twelve she said and a little later eleven and then ten and nine and then eight and seven almost together sue looked solicitously out the window what was there to count there was only a bare dreary yard to be seen and the blank side of the brick house twenty feet away an old old ivy vine gnarled and decayed at the roots climbed half way up the brick wall the cold breath of autumn had stricken its leaves from the vine until its skeleton branches clung almost bare to the crumbling bricks what is it dear asked sue six said johnsy in almost a whisper they re falling faster now three days ago there were almost a hundred it made my head ache to count them but now it s easy there goes another one there are only five left now five what dear tell your sudie leaves on the ivy vine when the last one falls i must go too i ve known that for three days didn t the doctor tell you oh i never heard of such nonsense complained sue with magnificent scorn what have old ivy leaves to do with your getting well and you used to love that vine so you naughty girl don t be a goosey why the doctor told me this morning that your chances for getting well real soon were let s see exactly what he said he said the chances were ten to one why that s almost as good a chance as we have in new york when we ride on the street cars or walk past a new building try to take some broth now and let sudie go back to her drawing so she can sell the editor man with it and buy port wine for her sick child and pork chops for her greedy self you needn t get any more wine said johnsy keeping her eyes fixed out the window there goes another no i don t want any broth that leaves just four i want to see the last one fall before it gets dark then i ll go too johnsy dear said sue bending over her will you promise me to keep your eyes closed and not look out the window until i am done working i must hand those drawings in by to morrow i need the light or i would draw the shade down couldn t you draw in the other room asked johnsy coldly i d rather be here by you said sue besides i don t want you to keep looking at those silly ivy leaves tell me as soon as you have finished said johnsy closing her eyes and lying white and still as a fallen statue because i want to see the last one fall i m tired of waiting i m tired of thinking i went to turn loose my hold on everything and go sailing down down just like one of those poor tired leaves try to sleep said sue i must call behrman up to be my model for the old hermit miner i ll not be gone a minute don t try to move till i come back old behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor beneath them he was past sixty and had a michael angelo s moses beard curling down from the head of a satyr along the body of an imp behrman was a failure in art forty years he had wielded the brush without getting near enough to touch the hem of his mistress s robe he had been always about to paint a masterpiece but had never yet begun it for several years he had painted nothing except now and then a daub in the line of commerce or advertising he earned a little by serving as a model to those young artists in the colony who could not pay the price of a professional he drank gin to excess and still talked of his coming masterpiece for the rest he was a fierce little old man who scoffed terribly at softness in any one and who regarded himself as especial mastiff in waiting to protect the two young artists in the studio above sue found behrman smelling strongly of juniper berries in his dimly lighted den below in one corner was a blank canvas on an easel that had been waiting there for twenty five years to receive the first line of the masterpiece she told him of johnsy s fancy and how she feared she would indeed light and fragile as a leaf herself float away when her slight hold upon the world grew weaker old behrman with his red eyes plainly streaming shouted his contempt and derision for such idiotic imaginings vass he cried is dere people in de world mit der foolishness to die because leafs dey drop off from a confounded vine i haf not heard of such a thing no i will not bose as a model for your fool hermit dunderhead vy do you allow dot silly pusiness to come in der prain of her ach dot poor lettle miss johnsy she is very ill and weak said sue and the fever has left her mind morbid and full of strange fancies very well mr behrman if you do not care to pose for me you needn t but i think you are a horrid old old flibbertigibbet you are just like a woman yelled behrman who said i will not bose go on i come mit you for half an hour i haf peen trying to say dot i am ready to bose gott dis is not any blace in which one so goot as miss yohnsy shall lie sick some day i vill baint a masterpiece and ve shall all go away gott yes johnsy was sleeping when they went upstairs sue pulled the shade down to the window sill and motioned behrman into the other room in there they peered out the window fearfully at the ivy vine then they looked at each other for a moment without speaking a persistent cold rain was falling mingled with snow behrman in his old blue shirt took his seat as the hermit miner on an upturned kettle for a rock when sue awoke from an hour s sleep the next morning she found johnsy with dull wide open eyes staring at the drawn green shade pull it up i want to see she ordered in a whisper wearily sue obeyed but lo after the beating rain and fierce gusts of wind that had endured through the livelong night there yet stood out against the brick wall one ivy leaf it was the last on the vine still dark green near its stem but with its serrated edges tinted with the yellow of dissolution and decay it hung bravely from a branch some twenty feet above the ground it is the last one said johnsy i thought it would surely fall during the night i heard the wind it will fall to day and i shall die at the same time dear dear said sue leaning her worn face down to the pillow think of me if you won t think of yourself what would i do but johnsy did not answer the lonesomest thing in all the world is a soul when it is making ready to go on its mysterious far journey the fancy seemed to possess her more strongly as one by one the ties that bound her to friendship and to earth were loosed the day wore away and even through the twilight they could see the lone ivy leaf clinging to its stem against the wall and then with the coming of the night the north wind was again loosed while the rain still beat against the windows and pattered down from the low dutch eaves when it was light enough johnsy the merciless commanded that the shade be raised the ivy leaf was still there johnsy lay for a long time looking at it and then she called to sue who was stirring her chicken broth over the gas stove i ve been a bad girl sudie said johnsy something has made that last leaf stay there to show me how wicked i was it is a sin to want to die you may bring me a little broth now and some milk with a little port in it and no bring me a hand mirror first and then pack some pillows about me and i will sit up and watch you cook an hour later she said sudie some day i hope to paint the bay of naples the doctor came in the afternoon and sue had an excuse to go into the hallway as he left even chances said the doctor taking sue s thin shaking hand in his with good nursing you ll win and now i must see another case i have downstairs behrman his name is some kind of an artist i believe pneumonia too he is an old weak man and the attack is acute there is no hope for him but he goes to the hospital to day to be made more comfortable the next day the doctor said to sue she s out of danger you ve won nutrition and care now that s all and that afternoon sue came to the bed where johnsy lay contentedly knitting a very blue and very useless woolen shoulder scarf and put one arm around her pillows and all i have something to tell you white mouse she said mr behrman died of pneumonia to day in the hospital he was ill only two days the janitor found him on the morning of the first day in his room downstairs helpless with pain his shoes and clothing were wet through and icy cold they couldn t imagine where he had been on such a dreadful night and then they found a lantern still lighted and a ladder that had been dragged from its place and some scattered brushes and a palette with green and yellow colors mixed on it and look out the window dear at the last ivy leaf on the wall didn t you wonder why it never fluttered or moved when the wind blew ah darling it s behrman s masterpiece he painted it there the night that the last leaf fell the count and the wedding guest one evening when andy donovan went to dinner at his second avenue boarding house mrs scott introduced him to a new boarder a young lady miss conway miss conway was small and unobtrusive she wore a plain snuffy brown dress and bestowed her interest which seemed languid upon her plate she lifted her diffident eyelids and shot one perspicuous judicial glance at mr donovan politely murmured his name and returned to her mutton mr donovan bowed with the grace and beaming smile that were rapidly winning for him social business and political advancement and erased the snuffy brown one from the tablets of his consideration two weeks later andy was sitting on the front steps enjoying his cigar there was a soft rustle behind and above him and andy turned his head and had his head turned just coming out the door was miss conway she wore a night black dress of crepe de crepe de oh this thin black goods her hat was black and from it drooped and fluttered an ebon veil filmy as a spider s web she stood on the top step and drew on black silk gloves not a speck of white or a spot of color about her dress anywhere her rich golden hair was drawn with scarcely a ripple into a shining smooth knot low on her neck her face was plain rather than pretty but it was now illuminated and made almost beautiful by her large gray eyes that gazed above the houses across the street into the sky with an expression of the most appealing sadness and melancholy gather the idea girls all black you know with the preference for crepe de oh crepe de chine that s it all black and that sad faraway look and the hair shining under the black veil you have to be a blonde of course and try to look as if although your young life had been blighted just as it was about to give a hop skip and a jump over the threshold of life a walk in the park might do you good and be sure to happen out the door at the right moment and oh it ll fetch em every time but it s fierce now how cynical i am ain t it to talk about mourning costumes this way mr donovan suddenly reinscribed miss conway upon the tablets of his consideration he threw away the remaining inch and a quarter of his cigar that would have been good for eight minutes yet and quickly shifted his center of gravity to his low cut patent leathers it s a fine clear evening miss conway he said and if the weather bureau could have heard the confident emphasis of his tones it would have hoisted the square white signal and nailed it to the mast to them that has the heart to enjoy it it is mr donovan said miss conway with a sigh mr donovan in his heart cursed fair weather heartless weather it should hail and blow and snow to be consonant with the mood of miss conway i hope none of your relatives i hope you haven t sustained a loss ventured mr donovan death has claimed said miss conway hesitating not a relative but one who but i will not intrude my brief upon you mr donovan intrude protested mr donovan why say miss conway i d be delighted that is i d be sorry i mean i m sure nobody could sympathize with you truer than i would miss conway smiled a little smile and oh it was sadder than her expression in repose laugh and the world laughs with you weep and they give you the laugh she quoted i have learned that mr donovan i have no friends or acquaintances in this city but you have been kind to me i appreciate it highly he had passed her the pepper twice at the table it s tough to be alone in new york that s a cinch said mr donovan but say whenever this little old town does loosen up and get friendly it goes the limit say you took a little stroll in the park miss conway don t you think it might chase away some of your mullygrubs and if you d allow me thanks mr donovan i d be pleased to accept of your escort if you think the company of one whose heart is filled with gloom could be anyways agreeable to you through the open gates of the iron railed old downtown park where the elect once took the air they strolled and found a quiet bench there is this difference between the grief of youth and that of old age youth s burden is lightened by as much of it as another shares old age may give and give but the sorrow remains the same he was my fiance confided miss conway at the end of an hour we were going to be married next spring i don t want you to think that i am stringing you mr donovan but he was a real count he had an estate and a castle in italy count fernando mazzini was his name i never saw the beat of him for elegance papa objected of course and once we eloped but papa overtook us and took us back i thought sure papa and fernando would fight a duel papa has a livery business in p kipsee you know finally papa came round all right and said we might be married next spring fernando showed him proofs of his title and wealth and then went over to italy to get the castle fixed up for us papa s very proud and when fernando wanted to give me several thousand dollars for my trousseau he called him down something awful he wouldn t even let me take a ring or any presents from him and when fernando sailed i came to the city and got a position as cashier in a candy store three days ago i got a letter from italy forwarded from p kipsee saying that fernando had been killed in a gondola accident that is why i am in mourning my heart mr donovan will remain forever in his grave i guess i am poor company mr donovan but i cannot take any interest in no one i should not care to keep you from gayety and your friends who can smile and entertain you perhaps you would prefer to walk back to the house now girls if you want to observe a young man hustle out after a pick and shovel just tell him that your heart is in some other fellow s grave young men are grave robbers by nature ask any widow something must be done to restore that missing organ to weeping angels in crepe de chine dead men certainly get the worst of it from all sides i m awfully sorry said mr donovan gently no we won t walk back to the house just yet and don t say you haven t no friends in this city miss conway i m awful sorry and i want you to believe i m your friend and that i m awful sorry i ve got his picture here in my locket said miss conway after wiping her eyes with her handkerchief i never showed it to anybody but i will to you mr donovan because i believe you to be a true friend mr donovan gazed long and with much interest at the photograph in the locket that miss conway opened for him the face of count mazzini was one to command interest it was a smooth intelligent bright almost a handsome face the face of a strong cheerful man who might well be a leader among his fellows i have a larger one framed in my room said miss conway when we return i will show you that they are all i have to remind me of fernando but he ever will be present in my heart that s a sure thing a subtle task confronted mr donovan that of supplanting the unfortunate count in the heart of miss conway this his admiration for her determined him to do but the magnitude or the undertaking did not seem to weigh upon his spirits the sympathetic but cheerful friend was the role he essayed and he played it so successfully that the next half hour found them conversing pensively across two plates of ice cream though yet there wars no diminution of the sadness in miss conway s large gray eyes before they parted in the hall that evening she ran upstairs and brought down the framed photograph wrapped lovingly in a white silk scarf mr donovan surveyed it with inscrutable eyes he gave me this the night he left for italy said miss conway i had the one for the locket made from this a fine looking man said mr donovan heartily how would it suit you miss conway to give me the pleasure of your company to coney next sunday afternoon a month later they announced their engagement to mrs scott and the other boarders miss conway continued to wear black a week after the announcement the two sat on the same bench in the downtown park while the fluttering leaves of the trees made a dim kinetoscopic picture of them in the moonlight but donovan had worn a look of abstracted gloom all day he was so silent to night that love s lips could not keep back any longer the questions that love s heart propounded what s the matter andy you are so solemn and grouchy to night nothing maggie i know better can t i tell you never acted this way before what is it it s nothing much maggie yes it is and i want to know i ll bet it s some other girl you are thinking about all right why don t you go get her if you want her take your arm away if you please i ll tell you then said andy wisely but i guess you won t understand it exactly you ve heard of mike sullivan haven t you big mike sullivan everybody calls him no i haven t said maggie and i don t want to if he makes you act like this who is he he s the biggest man in new york said andy almost reverently he can about do anything he wants to with tammany or any other old thing in the political line he s a mile high and as broad as east river you say anything against big mike and you ll have a million men on your collarbone in about two seconds why he made a visit over to the old country awhile back and the kings took to their holes like rabbits well big mike s a friend of mine i ain t more than deuce high in the district as far as influence goes but mike s as good a friend to a little man or a poor man as he is to a big one i met him to day on the bowery and what do you think he does comes up and shakes hands andy says he i ve been keeping cases on you you ve been putting in some good licks over on your side of the street and i m proud of you what ll you take to drink he takes a cigar and i take a highball i told him i was going to get married in two weeks andy says he send me an invitation so i ll keep in mind of it and i ll come to the wedding that s what big mike says to me and he always does what he says you don t understand it maggie but i d have one of my hands cut off to have big mike sullivan at our wedding it would be the proudest day of my life when he goes to a man s wedding there s a guy being married that s made for life now that s why i m maybe looking sore to night why don t you invite him then if he s so much to the mustard said maggie lightly there s a reason why i can t said andy sadly there s a reason why he mustn t be there don t ask me what it is for i can t tell you oh i don t care said maggie it s something about politics of course but it s no reason why you can t smile at me maggie said andy presently do you think as much of me as you did of your as you did of the count mazzini he waited a long time but maggie did not reply and then suddenly she leaned against his shoulder and began to cry to cry and shake with sobs holding his arm tightly and wetting the crepe de chine with tears there there there soothed andy putting aside his own trouble and what is it now andy sobbed maggie i ve lied to you and you ll never marry me or love me any more but i feel that i ve got to tell andy there never was so much as the little finger of a count i never had a beau in my life but all the other girls had and they talked about em and that seemed to make the fellows like em more and andy i look swell in black you know i do so i went out to a photograph store and bought that picture and had a little one made for my locket and made up all that story about the count and about his being killed so i could wear black and nobody can love a liar and you ll shake me andy and i ll die for shame oh there never was anybody i liked but you and that s all but instead of being pushed away she found andy s arm folding her closer she looked up and saw his face cleared and smiling could you could you forgive me andy sure said andy it s all right about that back to the cemetery for the count you ve straightened everything out maggie i was in hopes you would before the wedding day bully girl andy said maggie with a somewhat shy smile after she had been thoroughly assured of forgiveness did you believe all that story about the count well not to any large extent said andy reaching for his cigar case because it s big mike sullivan s picture you ve got in that locket of yours the country of elusion the cunning writer will choose an indefinable subject for he can then set down his theory of what it is and next at length his conception of what it is not and lo his paper is covered therefore let us follow the prolix and unmapable trail into that mooted country bohemia grainger sub editor of doc s magazine closed his roll top desk put on his hat walked into the hall punched the down button and waited for the elevator grainger s day had been trying the chief had tried to ruin the magazine a dozen times by going against grainger s ideas for running it a lady whose grandfather had fought with mcclellan had brought a portfolio of poems in person grainger was curator of the lion s house of the magazine that day he had lunched an arctic explorer a short story writer and the famous conductor of a slaughter house expose consequently his mind was in a whirl of icebergs maupassant and trichinosis but there was a surcease and a recourse there was bohemia he would seek distraction there and let s see he would call by for mary adrian half an hour later he threaded his way like a brazilian orchid hunter through the palm forest in the tiled entrance hall of the idealia apartment house one day the christeners of apartment houses and the cognominators of sleeping cars will meet and there will be some jealous and sanguinary knifing the clerk breathed grainger s name so languidly into the house telephone that it seemed it must surely drop from sheer inertia down to the janitor s regions but at length it soared dilatorily up to miss adrian s ear certainly mr grainger was to come up immediately a colored maid with an eliza crossing the ice expression opened the door of the apartment for him grainger walked sideways down the narrow hall a bunch of burnt umber hair and a sea green eye appeared in the crack of a door a long white undraped arm came out barring the way so glad you came ricky instead of any of the others said the eye light a cigarette and give it to me going to take me to dinner fine go into the front room till i finish dressing but don t sit in your usual chair there s pie in it meringue kappelman threw it at reeves last evening while he was reciting sophy has just come to straighten up is it lit thanks there s scotch on the mantel oh no it isn t that s chartreuse ask sophy to find you some i won t be long grainger escaped the meringue as he waited his spirits sank still lower the atmosphere of the room was as vapid as a zephyr wandering over a vesuvian lava bed relics of some feast lay about the room scattered in places where even a prowling cat would have been surprised to find them a straggling cluster of deep red roses in a marmalade jar bowed their heads over tobacco ashes and unwashed goblets a chafing dish stood on the piano a leaf of sheet music supported a stack of sandwiches in a chair mary came in dressed and radiant her gown was of that thin black fabric whose name through the change of a single vowel seems to summon visions ranging between the extremes of man s experience spelled with an e it belongs to gallic witchery and diaphanous dreams with an e it drapes lamentation and woe that evening they went to the cafe andre and as people would confide to you in a whisper that andre s was the only truly bohemian restaurant in town it may be well to follow them andre began his professional career as a waiter in a bowery ten cent eating house had you seen him there you would have called him tough to yourself not aloud for he would have soaked you as quickly as he would have soaked his thumb in your coffee he saved money and started a basement table d hote in eighth or ninth street one afternoon andre drank too much absinthe he announced to his startled family that he was the grand llama of thibet therefore requiring an empty audience hall in which to be worshiped he moved all the tables and chairs from the restaurant into the back yard wrapped a red table cloth around himself and sat on a step ladder for a throne when the diners began to arrive madame in a flurry of despair laid cloths and ushered them trembling outside between the tables clothes lines were stretched bearing the family wash a party of bohemia hunters greeted the artistic innovation with shrieks and acclamations of delight that week s washing was not taken in for two years when andre came to his senses he had the menu printed on stiffly starched cuffs and served the ices in little wooden tubs next he took down his sign and darkened the front of the house when you went there to dine you fumbled for an electric button and pressed it a lookout slid open a panel in the door looked at you suspiciously and asked if you were acquainted with senator herodotus q mcmilligan of the chickasaw nation if you were you were admitted and allowed to dine if you were not you were admitted and allowed to dine there you have one of the abiding principles of bohemia when andre had accumulated he moved up town near broadway in the fierce light that beats upon the thrown down there we find him and leave him with customers in pearls and automobile veils striving to catch his excellently graduated nod of recognition there is a large round table in the northeast corner of andre s at which six can sit to this table grainger and mary adrian made their way kappelman and reeves were already there and miss tooker who designed the may cover for the ladies notathome magazine and mrs pothunter who never drank anything but black and white highballs being in mourning for her husband who oh i ve forgotten what he did died like as not spaghetti weary reader wouldst take one penny in the slot peep into the fair land of bohemia then look and when you think you have seen it you have not and it is neither thimbleriggery nor astigmatism the walls of the cafe andre were covered with original sketches by the artists who furnished much of the color and sound of the place fair woman furnished the theme for the bulk of the drawings when you say sirens and siphons you come near to estimating the alliterative atmosphere of andre s first i want you to meet my friend miss adrian miss tooker and mrs pothunter you already know while she tucks in the fingers of her elbow gloves you shall have her daguerreotype so faint and uncertain shall the portrait be age somewhere between twenty seven and highneck evening dresses camaraderie in large bunches whatever the fearful word may mean habitat anywhere from seattle to terra del fuego temperament uncharted she let reeves squeeze her hand after he recited one of his poems but she counted the change after sending him out with a dollar to buy some pickled pig s feet deportment out of a possible morals mary was one of the princesses of bohemia in the first place it was a royal and a daring thing to have been named mary there are twenty fifines and heloises to one mary in the country of elusion now her gloves are tucked in miss tooker has assumed a june poster pose mrs pothunter has bitten her lips to make the red show reeves has several times felt his coat to make sure that his latest poem is in the pocket it had been neatly typewritten but he has copied it on the backs of letters with a pencil kappelman is underhandedly watching the clock it is ten minutes to nine when the hour comes it is to remind him of a story synopsis a french girl says to her suitor did you ask my father for my hand at nine o clock this morning as you said you would i did not he replies at nine o clock i was fighting a duel with swords in the bois de boulogne coward she hisses the dinner was ordered you know how the bohemian feast of reason keeps up with the courses humor with the oysters wit with the soup repartee with the entree brag with the roast knocks for whistler and kipling with the salad songs with the coffee the slapsticks with the cordials between miss adrian s eyebrows was the pucker that shows the intense strain it requires to be at ease in bohemia pat must come each sally mot and epigram every second of deliberation upon a reply costs you a bay leaf fine as a hair a line began to curve from her nostrils to her mouth to hold her own not a chance must be missed a sentence addressed to her must be as a piccolo each word of it a stop which she must be prepared to seize upon and play and she must always be quicker than a micmac indian to paddle the light canoe of conversation away from the rocks in the rapids that flow from the pierian spring for plodding reader the handwriting on the wall in the banquet hall of bohemia is laisser faire the gray ghost that sometimes peeps through the rings of smoke is that of slain old king convention freedom is the tyrant that holds them in slavery as the dinner waned hands reached for the pepper eruct rather than for the shaker of attic salt miss tooker with an elbow to business leaned across the table toward grainger upsetting her glass of wine now while you are fed and in good humor she said i want to make a suggestion to you about a new cover a good idea said grainger mopping the tablecloth with his napkin i ll speak to the waiter about it kappelman the painter was the cut up as a piece of delicate athenian wit he got up from his chair and waltzed down the room with a waiter that dependent no doubt an honest pachydermatous worthy tax paying art despising biped released himself from the unequal encounter carried his professional smile back to the dumb waiter and dropped it down the shaft to eternal oblivion reeves began to make keats turn in his grave mrs pothunter told the story of the man who met the widow on the train miss adrian hummed what is still called a chanson in the cafes of bridgeport grainger edited each individual effort with his assistant editor s smile which meant great but you ll have to send them in through the regular channels if i were the chief now but you know how it is and soon the head waiter bowed before them desolated to relate that the closing hour had already become chronologically historical so out all trooped into the starry midnight falling the street with gay laughter to be barked at by hopeful cabmen and enviously eyed by the dull inhabitants of an uninspired world grainger left mary at the elevator in the trackless palm forest of the idealia after he had gone she came down again carrying a small hand bag phoned for a cab drove to the grand central station boarded a commuter s train rode four hours with her burnt umber head bobbing against the red plush back of the seat and landed during a fresh stinging glorious sunrise at a deserted station the size of a peach crate called crocusville she walked a mile and clicked the latch of a gate a bare brown cottage stood twenty yards back an old man with a pearl white calvinistic face and clothes dyed blacker than a raven in a coal mine was washing his hands in a tin basin on the front porch how are you father said mary timidly i am as well as providence permits mary ann you will find your mother in the kitchen in the kitchen a cryptic gray woman kissed her glacially on the forehead and pointed out the potatoes which were not yet peeled for breakfast mary sat in a wooden chair and decorticated spuds with a thrill in her heart for breakfast there were grace cold bread potatoes bacon and tea you are pursuing the same avocation in the city concerning which you have advised us from time to time by letter i trust said her father yes said mary i am still reviewing books for the same publication after breakfast she helped wash the dishes and then all three sat in straigh back chairs in the bare floored parlor it is my custom said the old man on the sabbath day to read aloud from the great work entitled the apology for authorized and set forms of liturgy by the ecclesiastical philosopher and revered theologian jeremy taylor i know it said mary blissfully folding her hands for two hours the numbers of the great jeremy rolled forth like the notes of an oratorio played on the violoncello mary sat gloating in the new sensation of racking physical discomfort that the wooden chair brought her perhaps there is no happiness in life so perfect as the martyr s jeremy s minor chords soothed her like the music of a tom tom why oh why she said to herself does some one not write words to it at eleven they went to church in crocusville the back of the pine bench on which she sat had a penitential forward tilt that would have brought st simeon down in jealousy from his pillar the preacher singled her out and thundered upon her vicarious head the damnation of the world at each side of her an adamant parent held her rigidly to the bar of judgment an ant crawled upon her neck but she dared not move she lowered her eyes before the congregation a hundred eyed cerberus that watched the gates through which her sins were fast thrusting her her soul was filled with a delirious almost a fanatic joy for she was out of the clutch of the tyrant freedom dogma and creed pinioned her with beneficent cruelty as steel braces bind the feet of a crippled child she was hedged adjured shackled shored up strait jacketed silenced ordered when they came out the minister stopped to greet them mary could only hang her head and answer yes sir and no sir to his questions when she saw that the other women carried their hymn books at their waists with their left hands she blushed and moved hers there too from her right she took the three o clock train back to the city at nine she sat at the round table for dinner in the cafe andre nearly the same crowd was there where have you been to day asked mrs pothunter i phoned to you at twelve i have been away in bohemia answered mary with a mystic smile there mary has given it away she has spoiled my climax for i was to have told you that bohemia is nothing more than the little country in which you do not live if you try to obtain citizenship in it at once the court and retinue pack the royal archives and treasure and move away beyond the hills it is a hillside that you turn your head to peer at from the windows of the through express at exactly half past eleven kappelman deceived by a new softness and slowness of riposte and parry in mary adrian tried to kiss her instantly she slapped his face with such strength and cold fury that he shrank down sobered with the flaming red print of a hand across his leering features and all sounds ceased as when the shadows of great wings come upon a flock of chattering sparrows one had broken the paramount law of sham bohemia the law of laisser faire the shock came not from the blow delivered but from the blow received with the effect of a schoolmaster entering the play room of his pupils was that blow administered women pulled down their sleeves and laid prim hands against their ruffled side locks men looked at their watches there was nothing of the effect of a brawl about it it was purely the still panic produced by the sound of the ax of the fly cop conscience hammering at the gambling house doors of the heart with their punctilious putting on of cloaks with their exaggerated pretense of not having seen or heard with their stammering exchange of unaccustomed formalities with their false show of a light hearted exit i must take leave of my bohemian party mary has robbed me of my climax and she may go but i am not defeated somewhere there exists a great vault miles broad and miles long more capacious than the champagne caves of france in that vault are stored the anticlimaxes that should have been tagged to all the stories that have been told in the world i shall cheat that vault of one deposit minnie brown with her aunt came from crocusville down to the city to see the sights and because she had escorted me to fishless trout streams and exhibited to me open plumbed waterfalls and broken my camera while i julyed in her village i must escort her to the hives containing the synthetic clover honey of town especially did the custom made bohemia charm her the spaghetti wound its tendrils about her heart the free red wine drowned her belief in the existence of commercialism in the world she was dared and enchanted by the rugose wit that can be churned out of california claret but one evening i got her away from the smell of halibut and linoleum long enough to read to her the manuscript of this story which then ended before her entrance into it i read it to her because i knew that all the printing presses in the world were running to try to please her and some others and i asked her about it i didn t quite catch the trains said she how long was mary in crocusville ten hours and five minutes i replied well then the story may do said minnie but if she had stayed there a week kappelman would have got his kiss the ferry of unfulfilment at the street corner as solid as granite in the rush hour tide of humanity stood the man from nome the arctic winds and sun had stained him berry brown his eye still held the azure glint of the glaciers he was as alert as a fox as tough as a caribou cutlet and as broad gauged as the aurora borealis he stood sprayed by a niagara of sound the crash of the elevated trains clanging cars pounding of rubberless tires and the antiphony of the cab and truck drivers indulging in scarifying repartee and so with his gold dust cashed in to the merry air of a hundred thousand and with the cakes and ale of one week in gotham turning bitter on his tongue the man from nome sighed to set foot again in chilkoot the exit from the land of street noises and dead sea apple pies up sixth avenue with the tripping scurrying chattering bright eyed homing tide came the girl from sieber mason s the man from nome looked and saw first that she was supremely beautiful after his own conception of beauty and next that she moved with exactly the steady grace of a dog sled on a level crust of snow his third sensation was an instantaneous conviction that he desired her greatly for his own this quickly do men from nome make up their minds besides he was going back to the north in a short time and to act quickly was no less necessary a thousand girls from the great department store of sieber mason flowed along the sidewalk making navigation dangerous to men whose feminine field of vision for three years has been chiefly limited to siwash and chilkat squaws but the man from nome loyal to her who had resurrected his long cached heart plunged into the stream of pulchritude and followed her down twenty third street she glided swiftly looking to neither side no more flirtatious than the bronze diana above the garden her fine brown hair was neatly braided her neat waist and unwrinkled black skirt were eloquent of the double virtues taste and economy ten yards behind followed the smitten man from nome miss claribel colby the girl from sieber mason s belonged to that sad company of mariners known as jersey commuters she walked into the waiting room of the ferry and up the stairs and by a marvellous swift little run caught the ferry boat that was just going out the man from nome closed up his ten yards in three jumps and gained the deck close beside her miss colby chose a rather lonely seat on the outside of the upper cabin the night was not cold and she desired to be away from the curious eyes and tedious voices of the passengers besides she was extremely weary and drooping from lack of sleep on the previous night she had graced the

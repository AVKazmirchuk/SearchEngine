baldy woods reached for the bottle and got it whenever baldy went for anything he usually but this is not baldy s story he poured out a third drink that was larger by a finger than the first and second baldy was in consultation and the consultee is worthy of his hire i d be king if i was you said baldy so positively that his holster creaked and his spurs rattled webb yeager pushed back his flat brimmed stetson and made further disorder in his straw coloured hair the tonsorial recourse being without avail he followed the liquid example of the more resourceful baldy if a man marries a queen it oughtn t to make him a two spot declared webb epitomising his grievances sure not said baldy sympathetic still thirsty and genuinely solicitous concerning the relative value of the cards by rights you re a king if i was you i d call for a new deal the cards have been stacked on you i ll tell you what you are webb yeager what asked webb with a hopeful look in his pale blue eyes you re a prince consort go easy said webb i never blackguarded you none it s a title explained baldy up among the picture cards but it don t take no tricks i ll tell you webb it s a brand they re got for certain animals in europe say that you or me or one of them dutch dukes marries in a royal family well by and by our wife gets to be queen are we king not in a million years at the coronation ceremonies we march between little casino and the ninth grand custodian of the royal hall bedchamber the only use we are is to appear in photographs and accept the responsibility for the heir apparent that ain t any square deal yes sir webb you re a prince consort and if i was you i d start a interregnum or a habeus corpus or somethin and i d be king if i had to turn from the bottom of the deck baldy emptied his glass to the ratification of his warwick pose baldy said webb solemnly me and you punched cows in the same outfit for years we been runnin on the same range and ridin the same trails since we was boys i wouldn t talk about my family affairs to nobody but you you was line rider on the nopalito ranch when i married santa mcallister i was foreman then but what am i now i don t amount to a knot in a stake rope when old mcallister was the cattle king of west texas continued baldy with satanic sweetness you was some tallow you had as much to say on the ranch as he did i did admitted webb up to the time he found out i was tryin to get my rope over santa s head then he kept me out on the range as far from the ranch house as he could when the old man died they commenced to call santa the cattle queen i m boss of the cattle that s all she tends to all the business she handles all the money i can t sell even a beef steer to a party of campers myself santa s the queen and i m

of what has been tell her that to condemn and discard one who has not deserved such treatment without giving him her reasons or a chance to explain is contrary to her nature as i believe it to be tell her that i have thus to a certain degree disobeyed her injunctions in the hope that she may yet be inclined to see justice done go and tell her that the young man dropped a half dollar into the boy s hand the boy looked at him for a moment with bright canny eyes out of a dirty intelligent face and then set off at a run he approached the lady on the bench a little doubtfully but unembarrassed he touched the brim of the old plaid bicycle cap perched on the back of his head the lady looked at him coolly without prejudice or favour lady he said dat gent on de oder bench sent yer a song and dance by me if yer don t know de guy and he s tryin to do de johnny act say de word and i ll call a cop in t ree minutes if yer does know him and he s on de square w y i ll spiel yer de bunch of hot air he sent yer the young lady betrayed a faint interest a song and dance she said in a deliberate sweet voice that seemed to clothe her words in a diaphanous garment of impalpable irony a new idea in the troubadour line i suppose i used to know the gentleman who sent you so i think it will hardly be necessary to call the police you may execute your song and dance but do not sing too loudly it is a little early yet for open air vaudeville and we might attract attention awe said the boy with a shrug down the length of him yer know what i mean lady tain t a turn it s wind he told me to tell yer he s got his collars and cuffs in dat grip for a scoot clean out to frisco den he s goin to shoot snow birds in de klondike he says yer told him not to send round no more pink notes nor come hangin over de garden gate and he takes dis means of puttin yer wise he says yer refereed him out like a has been and never give him no chance to kick at de decision he says yer swiped him and never said why the slightly awakened interest in the young lady s eyes did not abate perhaps it was caused by either the originality or the audacity of the snow bird hunter in thus circumventing her express commands against the ordinary modes of communication she fixed her eye on a statue standing disconsolate in the dishevelled park and spoke into the transmitter tell the gentleman that i need not repeat to him a description of my ideals he knows what they have been and what they still are so far as they touch on this case absolute loyalty and truth are the ones paramount tell him that i have studied my own heart as well as one can and i know its weakness as well as i do its needs that is why i decline to hear his pleas whatever they may be i did not condemn him through hearsay or doubtful evidence and that is why i made no charge but since he persists in hearing what he already well knows you may convey the matter tell him that i entered the conservatory that evening from the rear to cut a rose for my mother tell him i saw him and miss ashburton beneath the pink oleander the tableau was pretty but the pose and juxtaposition were too eloquent and evident to require explanation i left the conservatory and at the same time the rose and my ideal you may carry that song and dance to your impresario i m shy on one word lady jux jux put me wise on dat will yer juxtaposition or you may call it propinquity or if you like being rather too near for one maintaining the position of an ideal the gravel spun from beneath the boy s feet he stood by the other bench the man s eyes interrogated him hungrily the boy s were shining with the impersonal zeal of the translator de lady says dat she s on to de fact dat gals is dead easy when a feller comes spielin ghost stories and tryin to make up and dat s why she won t listen to no soft soap she says she caught yer dead to rights huggin a bunch o calico in de hot house she side stepped in to pull some posies and yer was squeezin de oder gal to beat de band she says it looked cute all right all right but it made her sick she says yer better git busy and make a sneak for de train the young man gave a low whistle and his eyes flashed with a sudden thought his hand flew to the inside pocket of his coat and drew out a handful of letters selecting one he handed it to the boy following it with a silver dollar from his vest pocket give that letter to the lady he said and ask her to read it tell her that it should explain the situation tell her that if she had mingled a little trust with her conception of the ideal much heartache might have been avoided tell her that the loyalty she prizes so much has never wavered tell her i am waiting for an answer the messenger stood before the lady de gent says he s had de ski bunk put on him widout no cause he says he s no bum guy and lady yer read dat letter and i ll bet yer he s

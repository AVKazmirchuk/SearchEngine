regard to a recommendation to the convention that the bottles containing the tartrate of antimoney and potash and the tartrate of sodium and potash be kept in a contiguous position on the shelf gentleman to three fourteen said the clerk hastily i was whisked away to my room the next day i bought a trunk and clothing and began to live the life of edward pinkhammer i did not tax my brain with endeavors to solve problems of the past it was a piquant and sparkling cup that the great island city held up to my lips i drank of it gratefully the keys of manhattan belong to him who is able to bear them you must be either the city s guest or its victim the following few days were as gold and silver edward pinkhammer yet counting back to his birth by hours only knew the rare joy of having come upon so diverting a world full fledged and unrestrained i sat entranced on the magic carpets provided in theatres and roof gardens that transported one into strange and delightful lands full of frolicsome music pretty girls and grotesque drolly extravagant parodies upon human kind i went here and there at my own dear will bound by no limits of space time or comportment i dined in weird cabarets at weirder tables d h te to the sound of hungarian music and the wild shouts of mercurial artists and sculptors or again where the night life quivers in the electric glare like a kinetoscopic picture and the millinery of the world and its jewels and the ones whom they adorn and the men who make all three possible are met for good cheer and the spectacular effect and among all these scenes that i have mentioned i learned one thing that i never knew before and that is that the key to liberty is not in the hands of license but convention holds it comity has a toll gate at which you must pay or you may not enter the land of freedom in all the glitter the seeming disorder the parade the abandon i saw this law unobtrusive yet like iron prevail therefore in manhattan you must obey these unwritten laws and then you will be freest of the free if you decline to be bound by them you put on shackles sometimes as my mood urged me i would seek the stately softly murmuring palm rooms redolent with high born life and delicate restraint in which to dine again i would go down to the waterways in steamers packed with vociferous bedecked unchecked love making clerks and shop girls to their crude pleasures on the island shores and there was always broadway glistening opulent wily varying desirable broadway growing upon one like an opium habit one afternoon as i entered my hotel a stout man with a big nose and a black mustache blocked my way in the corridor when i would have passed around him he greet me with offensive familiarity hello bellford he cried loudly what the deuce are you doing in new york didn t know anything could drag you away from that old book den of yours is mrs b along or is this a little business run alone eh you have made a mistake sir i said coldly releasing my hand from his grasp my name is pinkhammer you will excuse me the man dropped to one side apparently astonished as i walked to the clerk s desk i heard him call to a bell boy and say something about telegraph blanks you will give me my bill i said to the clerk and have my baggage brought down in half an hour i do not care to remain where i am annoyed by confidence men i moved that afternoon to another hotel a sedate old fashioned one on lower fifth avenue there was a restaurant a little way off broadway where one could be served almost al fresco in a tropic array of screening flora quiet and luxury and a perfect service made it an ideal place in which to take luncheon or refreshment one afternoon i was there picking my way to a table among the ferns when i felt my sleeve caught mr bellford exclaimed an amazingly sweet voice i turned quickly to see a lady seated alone a lady of about thirty with exceedingly handsome eyes who looked at me as though i had been her very dear friend you were about to pass me she said accusingly don t tell me you do not know me why should we not shake hands at least once in fifteen years i shook hands with her at once i took a chair opposite her at the table i summoned with my eyebrows a hovering waiter the lady was philandering with an orange ice i ordered a cr me de menthe her hair was reddish bronze you could not look at it because you could not look away from her eyes but you were conscious of it as you are conscious of sunset while you look into the profundities of a wood at twilight are you sure you know me i asked no she said smiling i was never sure of that what would you think i said a little anxiously if i were to tell you that my name is edward pinkhammer from cornopolis kansas what would i think she repeated with a merry glance why that you had not brought mrs bellford to new york with you of course i do wish you had i would have liked to see marian her voice lowered slightly you haven t changed much elwyn i felt her wonderful eyes searching mine and my face more closely yes you have she amended and there was a soft exultant note in her latest tones i see it now you haven t forgotten you haven t forgotten for a year or a day or

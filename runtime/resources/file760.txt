music might have found a nocturne or a symphony to express the isolation of that blotted out world the clink of glass and bottle the aeolian chorus of the wind in the house crannies its deeper trombone through the canyon below and the wagnerian crash of the cook s pots and pans united in a fit discordant melody i thought no less welcome an accompaniment was the sizzling of broiling ham and venison cutlet indorsed by the solvent fumes of true java bringing rich promises of comfort to our yearning souls the cook brought the smoking supper to the table he nodded to me democratically as he cast the heavy plates around as though he were pitching quoits or hurling the discus i looked at him with some appraisement and curiosity and much conciliation there was no prophet to tell us when that drifting evil outside might cease to fall and it is well when snow bound to stand somewhere within the radius of the cook s favorable consideration but i could read neither favor nor disapproval in the face and manner of our pot wrestler he was about five feet nine inches and two hundred pounds of commonplace bull necked pink faced callous calm he wore brown duck trousers too tight and too short and a blue flannel shirt with sleeves rolled above his elbows there was a sort of grim steady scowl on his features that looked to me as though he had fixed it there purposely as a protection against the weakness of an inherent amiability that he fancied were better concealed and then i let supper usurp his brief occupancy of my thoughts draw up george said ross let s all eat while the grub s hot you fellows go on and chew answered the cook i ate mine in the kitchen before sun down think it ll be a big snow george asked the ranchman george had turned to reenter the cook room he moved slowly around and looking at his face it seemed to me that he was turning over the wisdom and knowledge of centuries in his head it might was his delayed reply at the door of the kitchen he stopped and looked back at us both ross and i held our knives and forks poised and gave him our regard some men have the power of drawing the attention of others without speaking a word their attitude is more effective than a shout and again it mightn t said george and went back to his stove after we had eaten he came in and gathered the emptied dishes he stood for a moment while his spurious frown deepened it might stop any minute he said or it might keep up for days at the farther end of the cook room i saw george pour hot water into his dishpan light his pipe and put the tableware through its required lavation he then carefully unwrapped from a piece of old saddle blanket a paperback book and settled himself to read by his dim oil lamp and then the ranchman threw tobacco on the cleared table and set forth again the bottles and glasses and i saw that i stood in a deep channel through which the long dammed flood of his discourse would soon be booming but i was half content comparing my fate with that of the late thomas tucker who had to sing for his supper thus doubling the burdens of both himself and his host snow is a hell of a thing said ross by way of a foreword it ain t somehow it seems to me salubrious i can stand water and mud and two inches below zero and a hundred and ten in the shade and medium sized cyclones but this here fuzzy white stuff naturally gets me all locoed i reckon the reason it rattles you is because it changes the look of things so much it s like you had a wife and left her in the morning with the same old blue cotton wrapper on and rides in of a night and runs across her all outfitted in a white silk evening frock waving an ostrich feather fan and monkeying with a posy of lily flowers wouldn t it make you look for your pocket compass you d be liable to kiss her before you collected your presence of mind by and by the flood of ross s talk was drawn up into the clouds so it pleased me to fancy and there condensed into the finer snowflakes of thought and we sat silent about the stove as good friends and bitter enemies will do i thought of boss s preamble about the mysterious influence upon man exerted by that ermine lined monster that now covered our little world and knew he was right of all the curious knickknacks mysteries puzzles indian gifts rat traps and well disguised blessings that the gods chuck down to us from the olympian peaks the most disquieting and evil bringing is the snow by scientific analysis it is absolute beauty and purity so at the beginning we look doubtfully at chemistry it falls upon the world and lo we live in another it hides in a night the old scars and familiar places with which we have grown heart sick or enamored so as quietly as we can we hustle on our embroidered robes and hie us on prince camaralzaman s horse or in the reindeer sleigh into the white country where the seven colors converge this is when our fancy can overcome the bane of it but in certain spots of the earth comes the snow madness made known by people turned wild and distracted by the bewildering veil that has obscured the only world they know in the cities the white fairy who sets the brains of her dupes whirling by a wave of her wand is cast for the comedy role her diamond shoe buckles

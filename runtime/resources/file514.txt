conspicuous advertisement assisted me further my name said i glibly is edward pinkhammer i am a druggist and my home is in cornopolis kansas i knew you were a druggist said my fellow traveler affably i saw the callous spot on your right forefinger where the handle of the pestle rubs of course you are a delegate to our national convention are all these men druggists i asked wonderingly they are this car came through from the west and they re your old time druggists too none of your patent tablet and granule pharmashootists that use slot machines instead of a prescription desk we percolate our own paregoric and roll our own pills and we ain t above handling a few garden seeds in the spring and carrying a side line of confectionery and shoes i tell you hampinker i ve got an idea to spring on this convention new ideas is what they want now you know the shelf bottles of tartar emetic and rochelle salt ant et pot tart and sod et pot tart one s poison you know and the other s harmless it s easy to mistake one label for the other where do druggists mostly keep em why as far apart as possible on different shelves that s wrong i say keep em side by side so when you want one you can always compare it with the other and avoid mistakes do you catch the idea it seems to me a very good one i said all right when i spring it on the convention you back it up we ll make some of these eastern orange phosphate and massage cream professors that think they re the only lozenges in the market look like hypodermic tablets if i can be of any aid i said warming the two bottles of er tartrate of antimony and potash and tartrate of soda and potash shall henceforth sit side by side i concluded firmly now there s another thing said mr bolder for an excipient in manipulating a pill mass which do you prefer the magnesia carbonate or the pulverised glycerrhiza radix the er magnesia i said it was easier to say than the other word mr bolder glanced at me distrustfully through his spectacles give me the glycerrhiza said he magnesia cakes here s another one of these fake aphasia cases he said presently handing me his newspaper and laying his finger upon an article i don t believe in em i put nine out of ten of em down as frauds a man gets sick of his business and his folks and wants to have a good time he skips out somewhere and when they find him he pretends to have lost his memory don t know his own name and won t even recognize the strawberry mark on his wife s left shoulder aphasia tut why can t they stay at home and forget i took the paper and read after the pungent headlines the following denver june elwyn c belford a prominent lawyer is mysteriously missing from his home since three days ago and all efforts to locate him have been in vain mr bellford is a well known citizen of the highest standing and has enjoyed a large and lucrative law practice he is married and owns a fine home and the most extensive private library in the state on the day of his disappearance he drew quite a large sum of money from his bank no one can be found who saw him after he left the bank mr bellford was a man of singularly quiet and domestic tastes and seemed to find his happiness in his home and profession if any clue at all exists to his strange disappearance it my be found in the fact that for some months he has been deeply absorbed in an important law case in connection with the q y and z railroad company it is feared that overwork may have affected his mind every effort is being made to discover the whereabouts of the missing man it seems to me you are not altogether uncynical mr bolder i said after i had read the despatch this has the sound to me of a genuine case why should this man prosperous happily married and respected choose suddenly to abandon everything i know that these lapses of memory do occur and that men do find themselves adrift without a name a history or a home oh gammon and jalap said mr bolder it s larks they re after there s too much education nowadays men know about aphasia and they use it for an excuse the women are wise too when it s all over they look you in the eye as scientific as you please and say he hypnotized me thus mr bolder diverted but did not aid me with his comments and philosophy we arrived in new york about ten at night i rode in a cab to a hotel and i wrote my name edward pinkhammer in the register as i did so i felt pervade me a splendid wild intoxicating buoyancy a sense of unlimited freedom of newly attained possibilities i was just born into the world the old fetters whatever they had been were stricken from my hands and feet the future lay before me a clear road such as an infant enters and i could set out upon it equipped with a man s learning and experience i thought the hotel clerk looked at me five seconds too long i had no baggage the druggists convention i said my trunk has somehow failed to arrive i drew out a roll of money ah said he showing an auriferous tooth we have quite a number of the western delegates stopping here he struck a bell for the boy i endeavored to give color to my r ole there is an important movement on foot among us westerners i said in

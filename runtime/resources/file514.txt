send down a big box of novels and reading matter for marthy things were going to be different he wondered whether a little piano could be placed in one of the rooms of the ranch house without the family having to move out of doors in nowise calculated to allay his self reproach was the thought that marthy and randy would have to pass the night alone in spite of their bickerings when night came marthy was wont to dismiss her fears of the country and rest her head upon sam s strong arm with a sigh of peaceful content and dependence and were her fears so groundless sam thought of roving marauding mexicans of stealthy cougars that sometimes invaded the ranches of rattlesnakes centipedes and a dozen possible dangers marthy would be frantic with fear randy would cry and call for dada to come still the interminable succession of stretches of brush cactus and mesquite hollow after hollow slope after slope all exactly alike all familiar by constant repetition and yet all strange and new if he could only arrive somewhere the straight line is art nature moves in circles a straightforward man is more an artificial product than a diplomatist is men lost in the snow travel in exact circles until they sink exhausted as their footprints have attested also travellers in philosophy and other mental processes frequently wind up at their starting point it was when sam webber was fullest of contrition and good resolves that mexico with a heavy sigh subsided from his regular brisk trot into a slow complacent walk they were winding up an easy slope covered with brush ten or twelve feet high i say now mex demurred sam this here won t do i know you re plumb tired out but we got ter git along oh lordy ain t there no mo houses in the world he gave mexico a smart kick with his heels mexico gave a protesting grunt as if to say what s the use of that now we re so near he quickened his gait into a languid trot rounding a great clump of black chaparral he stopped short sam dropped the bridle reins and sat looking into the back door of his own house not ten yards away marthy serene and comfortable sat in her rocking chair before the door in the shade of the house with her feet resting luxuriously upon the steps randy who was playing with a pair of spurs on the ground looked up for a moment at his father and went on spinning the rowels and singing a little song marthy turned her head lazily against the back of the chair and considered the arrivals with emotionless eyes she held a book in her lap with her finger holding the place sam shook himself queerly like a man coming out of a dream and slowly dismounted he moistened his dry lips i see you are still a settin he said a readin of them billy by dam yaller back novils sam had traveled round the circle and was himself again the rubber plant s story we rubber plants form the connecting link between the vegetable kingdom and the decorations of a waldorf astoria scene in a third avenue theatre i haven t looked up our family tree but i believe we were raised by grafting a gum overshoe on to a cent table d hote stalk of asparagus you take a white bulldog with a bourke cockran air of independence about him and a rubber plant and there you have the fauna and flora of a flat what the shamrock is to ireland the rubber plant is to the dweller in flats and furnished rooms we get moved from one place to another so quickly that the only way we can get our picture taken is with a kinetoscope we are the vagrant vine and the flitting fig tree you know the proverb where the rubber plant sits in the window the moving van draws up to the door we are the city equivalent to the woodbine and the honeysuckle no other vegetable except the pittsburg stogie can withstand as much handling as we can when the family to which we belong moves into a flat they set us in the front window and we become lares and penates fly paper and the peripatetic emblem of home sweet home we aren t as green as we look i guess we are about what you would call the soubrettes of the conservatory you try sitting in the front window of a flat in manhattan and looking out into the street all day and back into the flat at night and see whether you get wise or not hey talk about the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden of eden say suppose there had been a rubber plant there when eve but i was going to tell you a story the first thing i can remember i had only three leaves and belonged to a member of the pony ballet i was kept in a sunny window and was generally watered with seltzer and lemon i had plenty of fun in those days i got cross eyed trying to watch the numbers of the automobiles in the street and the dates on the labels inside at the same time well then the angel that was molting for the musical comedy lost his last feather and the company broke up the ponies trotted away and i was left in the window ownerless the janitor gave me to a refined comedy team on the eighth floor and in six weeks i had been set in the window of five different flats i took on experience and put out two more leaves miss carruthers of the refined comedy team did you ever see her cross both feet back of her neck gave me to a friend of hers who had made an unfortunate marriage with a man in a store consequently i was placed in the window of a furnished room rent in advance water two flights up gas extra after ten o clock at night two of my leaves withered off here also i was moved from one room to another so many times that i got to liking the odor of the pipes the expressmen smoked i don t think i ever had so dull a time as i did with this lady there was never anything amusing going on inside she was devoted to her husband and besides leaning out the window and flirting with the iceman she never did a thing toward breaking the monotony when the couple broke up they left me with the rest of their goods at a second hand store i was put out in front for sale along with the jobbiest lot you ever heard of being lumped into one bargain think of this little cornucopia of wonders all for henry james s works six talking machine records one pair of tennis shoes two bottles of horse radish and a rubber plant that was me one afternoon a girl came along and stopped to look at me she had dark hair and eyes and she looked slim and sad around the mouth oh oh she says to herself i never thought to see one up here she pulls out a little purse about as thick as one of my leaves and fingers over some small silver in it old koen always on the lockout is ready rubbing his hands this girl proceeds to turn down mr james and the other commodities rubber plants or nothing is the burden of her song and at last koen and she come together at cents and away she goes with me in her arms she was a nice girl but not my style too quiet and sober looking thinks i to myself i ll just about land on the fire escape of a tenement six stories up and i ll spend the next six months looking at clothes on the line but she carried me to a nice little room only three flights up in quite a decent street and she put me in the window of course and then she went to work and cooked dinner for herself and what do you suppose she had bread and tea and a little dab of jam nothing else not a single lobster nor so much as one bottle of champagne the carruthers comedy team had both every evening except now and then when they took a notion for pig s knuckle and kraut after she had finished her dinner my new owner came to the window and leaned down close to my leaves and cried softly to herself for a while it made me feel funny i never knew anybody to cry that way over a rubber plant before of course i ve seen a few of em turn on the tears for what they could get out of it but she seemed to be crying just for the pure enjoyment of it she touched my leaves like she loved em and she bent down her head and kissed each one of em i guess i m about the toughest specimen of a peripatetic orchid on earth but i tell you it made me feel sort of queer home never was like that to me before generally i used to get chewed by poodles and have shirt waists hung on me to dry and get watered with coffee grounds and peroxide of hydrogen this girl had a piano in the room and she used to disturb it with both hands while she made noises with her mouth for hours at a time i suppose she was practising vocal music one day she seemed very much excited and kept looking at the clock at eleven somebody knocked and she let in a stout dark man with towsled black hair he sat down at once at the piano and played while she sang for him when she finished she laid one hand on her bosom and looked at him he shook his head and she leaned against the piano two years already she said speaking slowly do you think in two more or even longer the man shook his head again you waste your time he said roughly i thought the voice is not there and then he looked at her in a peculiar way but the voice is not everything he went on you have looks i can place you as i told you if the girl pointed to the door without saying anything and the dark man left the room and then she came over and cried around me again it s a good thing i had enough rubber in me to be water proof about that time somebody else knocked at the door thank goodness i said to myself here s a chance to get the water works turned off i hope it s somebody that s game enough to stand a bird and a bottle to liven things up a little tell you the truth this little girl made me tired a rubber plant likes to see a little sport now and then i don t suppose there s another green thing in new york that sees as much of gay life unless it s the chartreuse or the sprigs of parsley around the dish when the girl opens the door in steps a young chap in a traveling cap and picks her up in his arms and she sings out oh dick and stays there long enough to well you ve been a rubber plant too sometimes i suppose good thing says i to myself this is livelier than scales and weeping now there ll be something doing you ve got to go back with me says the young man i ve come two thousand miles for you aren t you tired of it yet bess you ve kept all of us waiting so long haven t you found out yet what is best the bubble burst only to day says the girl come here dick and see what i found the other day on the sidewalk for sale she brings him by the hand and exhibits yours truly how one ever got away up here who can tell i bought it with almost the last money i had he looked at me but he couldn t keep his eyes off her for more than a second do you remember the night bess he said when we stood under one of those on the bank of the bayou and what you told me then geewillikins i said to myself both of them stand under a rubber plant seems to me they are stretching matters somewhat do i not says she looking up at him and sneaking close to his vest and now i say it again and it is to last forever look dick at its leaves how wet they are those are my tears and it was thinking of you that made them fall the dear old magnolias says the young man pinching one of my leaves i love them all magnolia well wouldn t that say those innocents thought i was a magnolia what the well wasn t that tough on a genuine little old new york rubber plant out of nazareth okochee in georgia had a boom and j pinkney bloom came out of it with a wad okochee came out of it with a half million dollar debt a two and a half per cent city property tax and a city council that showed a propensity for traveling the back streets of the town these things came about through a fatal resemblance of the river cooloosa to the hudson as set forth and expounded by a northern tourist okochee felt that new york should not be allowed to consider itself the only alligator in the swamp so to speak and then that harmless but persistent individual so numerous in the south the man who is always clamoring for more cotton mills and is ready to take a dollar s worth of stock provided he can borrow the dollar that man added his deadly work to the tourist s innocent praise and okochee fell the cooloosa river winds through a range of small mountains passes okochee and then blends its waters trippingly as fall the mellifluous indian syllables with the chattahoochee okochee rose as it were from its sunny seat on the post office stoop hitched up its suspender and threw a granite dam two hundred and forty feet long and sixty feet high across the cooloosa one mile above the town thereupon a dimpling sparkling lake backed up twenty miles among the little mountains thus in the great game of municipal rivalry did okochee match that famous drawing card the hudson it was conceded that nowhere could the palisades be judged superior in the way of scenery and grandeur following the picture card was played the ace of commercial importance fourteen thousand horsepower would this dam furnish cotton mills factories and manufacturing plants would rise up as the green corn after a shower the spindle and the flywheel and turbine would sing the shrewd glory of okochee along the picturesque heights above the lake would rise in beauty the costly villas and the splendid summer residences of capital the naphtha launch of the millionaire would spit among the romantic coves the verdured hills would take formal shapes of terrace lawn and park money would be spent like water in okochee and water would be turned into money the fate of the good town is quickly told capital decided not to invest of all the great things promised the scenery alone came to fulfilment the wooded peaks the impressive promontories of solemn granite the beautiful green slants of bank and ravine did all they could to reconcile okochee to the delinquency of miserly gold the sunsets gilded the dreamy draws and coves with a minting that should charm away heart burning okochee true to the instinct of its blood and clime was lulled by the spell it climbed out of the arena loosed its suspender sat down again on the post office stoop and took a chew it consoled itself by drawling sarcasms at the city council which was not to blame causing the fathers as has been said to seek back streets and figure perspiringly on the sinking fund and the appropriation for interest due the youth of okochee they who were to carry into the rosy future the burden of the debt accepted failure with youth s uncalculating joy for here was sport aquatic and nautical added to the meagre round of life s pleasures in yachting caps and flowing neckties they pervaded the lake to its limits girls wore silk waists embroidered with anchors in blue and pink the trousers of the young men widened at the bottom and their hands were proudly calloused by the oft plied oar fishermen were under the spell of a deep and tolerant jjoy sailboats and rowboats furrowed the lenient waves popcorn and ice cream booths sprang up about the little wooden pier two small excursion steamboats were built and plied the delectable waters okochee philosophically gave up the hope of eating turtle soup with a gold spoon and settled back not ill content to its regular diet of lotus and fried hominy and out of this slow wreck of great expectations rose up j pinkney bloom with his wad and his prosperous cheery smile needless to say j pinkney was no product of georgia soil he came out of that flushed and capable region known as the north he called himself a promoter his enemies had spoken of him as a grafter okochee took a middle course and held him to be no better nor no worse than a yank far up the lake eighteen miles above the town the eye of this cheerful camp follower of booms had spied out a graft he purchased there a precipitous tract of five hundred acres at forty five cents per acre and this he laid out and subdivided as the city of skyland the queen city of the switzerland of the south streets and avenues were surveyed parks designed corners of central squares reserved for the proposed opera house board of trade lyceum market public schools and exposition hall the price of lots ranged from five to five hundred dollars positively no lot would be priced higher than five hundred dollars while the boom was growing in okochee j pinkney s circulars maps and prospectuses were flying through the mails to every part of the country investors sent in their money by post and the skyland real estate company j pinkney bloom returned to each a deed duly placed on record to the best lot at the price on hand that day all this time the catamount screeched upon the reserved lot of the skyland board of trade the opossum swung by his tail over the site of the exposition hall and the owl hooted a melancholy recitative to his audience of young squirrels in opera house square later when the money was coming in fast j pinkney caused to be erected in the coming city half a dozen cheap box houses and persuaded a contingent of indigent natives to occupy them thereby assuming the role of poulation in subsequent prospectuses which became accordingly more seductive and remunerative so when the dream faded and okochee dropped back to digging bait and nursing its two and a half per cent tax j pinkney bloom unloving of checks and drafts and the cold interrogatories of bankers strapped about his fifty two inch waist a soft leather belt containing eight thousand dollars in big bills and said that all was very good one last trip he was making to skyland before departing to other salad fields skyland was a regular post office and the steamboat dixie belle under contract delivered the mail bag generally empty twice a week there was a little business there to be settled the postmaster was to be paid off for his light but lonely services and the inhabitants had to be furnished with another month s homely rations as per agreement and then skyland would know j pinkney bloom no more the owners of these precipitous barren useless lots might come and view the scene of their invested credulity or they might leave them to their fit tenants the wild hog and the browsing deer the work of the skyland real estate company was finished the little steamboat dixie belle was about to shove off on her regular up the lake trip when a rickety hired carriage rattled up to the pier and a tall elderly gentleman in black stepped out signaling courteously but vivaciously for the boat to wait time was of the least importance in the schedule of the dixie belle captain macfarland gave the order and the boat received its ultimate two passengers for upon the arm of the tall elderly gentleman as he crossed the gangway was a little elderly lady with a gray curl depending quaintly forward of her left ear captain macfarland was at the wheel therefore it seemed to j pinkney bloom who was the only other passenger that it should be his to play the part of host to the boat s new guests who were doubtless on a scenery viewing expedition he stepped forward with that translucent child candid smile upon his fresh pink countenance with that air of unaffected sincerity that was redeemed from bluffness only by its exquisite calculation with that promptitude and masterly decision of manner that so well suited his calling with all his stock in trade well to the front he stepped forward to receive colonel and mrs peyton blaylock with the grace of a grand marshal or a wedding usher he escorted the two passengers to a side of the upper deck from which the scenery was supposed to present itself to the observer in increased quantity and quality there in comfortable steamer chairs they sat and began to piece together the random lines that were to form an intelligent paragraph in the big history of little events our home sir said colonel blaylock removing his wide brimmed rather shapeless black felt hat is in holly springs holly springs georgia i am very proud to make your acquaintance mr bloom mrs blaylock and myself have just arrived in okochee this morning sir on business business of importance in connection with the recent rapid march of progress in this section of our state the colonel smoothed back with a sweeping gesture his long smooth locks his dark eyes still fiery under the heavy black brows seemed inappropriate to the face of a business man he looked rather to be an old courtier handed down from the reign of charles and re attired in a modern suit of fine but raveling and seam worn broadcloth yes sir said mr bloom in his heartiest prospectus voice things have been whizzing around okochee biggest industrial revival and waking up to natural resources georgia ever had did you happen to squeeze in on the ground floor in any of the gilt edged grafts colonel well sir said the colonel hesitating in courteous doubt if i understand your question i may say that i took the opportunity to make an investment that i believe will prove quite advantageous yes sir i believe it will result in both pecuniary profit and agreeable occupation colonel blaylock said the little edlerly lady shaking her gray curl and smiling indulgent explanation at j pinkney bloom is so devoted to businesss he has such a talent for financiering and markets and investments and those kind of things i think myself extremely fortunate in having secured him for a partner on life s journey i am so unversed in those formidable but very useful branches of learning colonel blaylock rose and made a bow a bow that belonged with silk stockings and lace ruffles and velvet practical affairs he said with a wave of his hand toward the promoter are if i may use the comparison the garden walks upon which we tread through life viewing upon either side of us the flowers which brighten that journey it is my pleasure to be able to lay out a walk or two mrs blaylock sir is one of those fortunate higher spirits whose mission it is to make the flowers grow perhaps mr bloom you have perused the lines of lorella the southern poetess that is the name above which mrs blaylock has contributed to the press of the south for many years unfortunately said mr bloom with a sense of the loss clearly written upon his frank face i m like the colonel in the walk making business myself and i haven t had time to even take a sniff at the flowers poetry is a line i never dealt in it must be nice though quite nice it is the region smiled mrs blaylock in which my soul dwells my shawl peyton if you please the breeze comes a little chilly from yon verdured hills the colonel drew from the tail pocket of his coat a small shawl of knitted silk and laid it solicitously about the shoulders of the lady mrs blaylock sighed contentedly and turned her expressive eyes still as clear and unworldly as a child s upon the steep slopes that were slowly slipping past very fair and stately they looked in the clear morning air they seemed to speak in familiar terms to the responsive spirit of lorella my native hills she murmured dreamily see how the foliage drinks the sunlight from the hollows and dells mrs blaylock s maiden days said the colonel interpreting her mood to j pinkney bloom were spent among the mountains of northern georgia mountain air and mountain scenery recall to her those days holly springs where we have lived for twenty years is low and flat i fear that she may have suffered in health and spirits by so long a residence there that is one portent reason for the change we are making my dear can you not recall those lines you wrote entitled i think the georgia hills the poem that was so extensively copied by the southern press and praised so highly by the atlanta critics mrs blaylock turned a glance of speaking tenderness upon the colonel fingered for a moment the silvery curl that drooped upon her bosom then looked again toward the mountains without preliminary or affectation or demurral she began in rather thrilling and more deeply pitched tones to recite these lines the georgia hills the georgia hills oh heart why dost thou pine are not these sheltered lowlands fair with mead and bloom and vine ah as the slow paced river here broods on its natal rills my spirit drifts in longing sweet back to the georgia hills and through the close drawn curtained night i steal on sleep s slow wings back to my heart s ease slopes of pine where end my wanderings oh heaven seems nearer from their tops and farther earthly ills even in dreams if i may but dream of my georgia hills the grass upon their orchard sides is a fine couch to me the common note of each small bird passes all minstrelsy it would not seem so dread a thing if when the reaper wills he might come there and take my hand up in the georgia hills thats great stuff ma am said j pinkney bloom enthusiastically when the poetess had concluded i wish i had looked up poetry more than i have i was raised in the pine hills myself the mountains ever call to their children murmured mrs blaylock i feel that life will take on the rosy hue of hope again in among these beautiful hills peyton a little taste of the currant wine if you will be so good the journey though delightful in the extreme slightly fatigues me colonel blaylock again visited the depths of his prolific coat and produced a tightly corked rough black bottle mr bloom was on his feet in an instant let me bring a glass ma am you come along colonel there s a little table we can bring too maybe we can scare up some fruit or a cup of tea on board i ll ask mac mrs blaylock reclined at ease few royal ladies have held their royal prerogative with the serene grace of the petted southern woman the colonel with an air as gallant and assiduous as in the days of his courtship and j pinkney bloom with a ponderous agility half professional and half directed by some resurrected unnamed long forgotten sentiment formed a diversified but attentive court the currant wine wine home made from the holly springs fruit went round and then j pinkney began to hear something of holly springs life it seemed from the conversation of the blaylocks that the springs was decadent a third of the population had moved away business and the colonel was an authority on business had dwindled to nothing after carefully studying the field of opportunities open to capital he had sold his little property there for eight hundred dollars and invested it in one of the enterprises opened up by the book in okochee might i inquire sir said mr bloom in what particular line of business you inserted your coin i know that town as well as i know the regulations for illegal use of the mails i might give you a hunch as to whether you can make the game go or not j pinkney somehow had a kindly feeling toward these unsophisticated representatives of by gone days they were so simple impractical and unsuspecting he was glad that he happened not to have a gold brick or a block of that western bad boy silver mine stock along with him he would have disliked to unload on people he liked so well as he did these but there are some temptations toe enticing to be resisted no sir said colonel blaylock pausing to arrange the queen s wrap i did not invest in okochee i have made an exhaustive study of business conditions and i regard old settled towns as unfavorable fields in which to place capital that is limited in amount some months ago through the kindness of a friend there came into my hands a map and description of this new town of skyland that has been built upon the lake the description was so pleasing the future of the town set forth in such convincing arguments and its increasing prosperity portrayed in such an attractive style that i decided to take advantage of the opportunity it offered i carefully selected a lot in the centre of the business district although its price was the highest in the schedule five hundred dollars and made the purchase at once are you the man i mean did you pay five hundred dollars for a lot in skyland asked j pinkney bloom i did sir answered the colonel with the air of a modest millionaire explaining his success a lot most excellently situated on the same square with the opera house and only two squares from the board of trade i consider the purchase a most fortuitous one it is my intention to erect a small building upon it at once and open a modest book and stationery store during past years i have met with many pecuniary reverses and i now find it necessary to engage in some commercial occupation that will furnish me with a livelihood the book and stationery business though an humble one seems to me not inapt nor altogether uncongenial i am a graduate of the university of virginia and mrs blaylock s really wonderful acquaintance with belles lettres and poetic literature should go far toward insuring success of course mrs blaylock would not personally serve behind the counter with the nearly three hundred dollars i have remaining i can manage the building of a house by giving a lien on the lot i have an old friend in atlanta who is a partner in a large book store and he has agreed to furnish me with a stock of goods on credit on extremely easy terms i am pleased to hope sir that mrs blaylock s health and happiness will be increased by the change of locality already i fancy i can perceive the return of those roses that were once the hope and despair of georgia cavaliers again followed that wonderful bow as the colonel lightly touched the pale cheek of the poetess mrs blaylock blushing like a girl shook her curl and gave the colonel an arch reproving tap secret of eternal youth where art thou every second the answer comes here here here listen to thine own heartbeats weary seeker after external miracles those years said mrs blaylock in holly springs were long long long but now is the promised land in sight skyland a lovely name doubtless said the colonel we shall be able to secure comfortable accommodations at some modest hotel at reasonable rates our trunks are in okochee to be forwarded when we shall have made permanent arrangements j pinkney bloom excused himself went forward and stood by the captain at the wheel mac said he do you remember my telling you once that i sold one of those five hundred dollar lots in skyland seems i do grinned captain macfarland i m not a coward as a general rule went on the promoter but i always said that if i ever met the sucker that bought that lot i d run like a turkey now you see that old babe in the wood over there well he s the boy that drew the prize that was the only five hundred dollar lot that went the rest ranged from ten dollars to two hundred his wife writes poetry she s invented one about the high grounds of georgia that s way up in g they re going to skyland to open a book store well said macfarland with another grin it s a good thing you are along j p you can show em around town until they begin to feel at home he s got three hundred dollars left to build a house and store with went on j pinkney as if he were talking to himself and he thinks there s an open house up there captain macfarland released the wheel long enough to give his leg a roguish slap you old fat rascal he chuckled with a wink mac you re a fool said j pinkney bloom coldly he went back and joined the blaylocks where he sat less talkative with that straight furrow between his brows that always stood as a signal of schemes being shaped within there s a good many swindles connected with these booms he said presently what if this skyland should turn out to be one that is suppose business should be sort of dull there and no special sale for books my dear sir said colonel blaylock resting his hand upon the back of his wife s chair three times i have been reduced to almost penury by the duplicity of others but i have not yet lost faith in humanity if i have been deceived again still we may glean health and content if not worldly profit i am aware that there are dishonest schemers in the world who set traps for the unwary but even they are not altogether bad my dear can you recall those verses entitled he giveth the increase that you composed for the choir of our church in holly springs that was four years ago said mrs blaylock perhans i can repeat a verse or two the lily springs from the rotting mould pearls from the deep sea slime good will come out of nazareth all in god s own time to the hardest heart the softening grace cometh at last to bless guiding it right to help and cheer and succor in distress i cannot remember the rest the lines were not ambitious they were written to the music composed by a dear friend it s a fine rhyme just the same declared mr bloom it seems to ring the bell all right i guess i gather the sense of it it means that the rankest kind of a phony will give you the best end of it once in a while mr bloom strayed thoughtfully back to the captain and stood meditating ought to be in sight of the spires and gilded domes of skyland now in a few minutes chirruped macfarland shaking with enjoyment go to the devil said mr bloom still pensive and now upon the left bank they caught a glimpse of a white village high up on the hills smothered among green trees that was cold branch no boom town but the slow growth of many years cold branch lay on the edge of the grape and corn lands the big country road ran just back of the heights cold branch had nothing in common with the frisky ambition of okochee with its impertinent lake mac said j pinkney suddenly i want you to stop at cold branch there s a landing there that they made to use sometimes when the river was up can t said the captain grinning more broadly i ve got the united states mails on board right to day this boat s in the government service do you want to have the poor old captain keelhauled by uncle sam and the great city of skyland all disconsolate waiting for its mail i m ashamed of your extravagance j p mac almost whispered j pinkney in his danger line voice i looked into the engine room of the dixie belle a while ago don t you know of somebody that needs a new boiler cement and black japan can t hide flaws from me and then those shares of building and loan that you traded for repairs they were all yours of course i hate to mention these things but oh come now j p said the captain you know i was just fooling i ll put you off at cold branch if you say so the other passengers get off there too said mr bloom further conversation was held and in ten minutes the dixie belle turned her nose toward a little cranky wooden pier on the left bank and the captain relinquishing the wheel to a roustabout came to the passenger deck and made the remarkable announcement all out for skyland the blaylocks and j pinkney bloom disembarked and the dixie belle proceeded on her way up the lake guided by the indefatigable promoter they slowly climbed the steep hillside pausing often to rest and admire the view finally they entered the village of cold branch warmly both the colonel and his wife praised it for its homelike and peaceful beauty mr bloom conducted them to a two story building on a shady street that bore the legend pine top inn here he took his leave receiving the cordial thanks of the two for his attentions the colonel remarking that he thought they would spend the remainder of the day in rest and take a look at his purchase on the morrow j pinkney bloom walked down cold branch s main street he did not know this town but he knew towns and his feet did not falter presently he saw a sign over a door frank e cooly attorney at law and notary public a young man was mr cooly and awaiting business get your hat son said mr bloom in his breezy way and a blank deed and come along it s a job for you now he continued when mr cooly had responded with alacrity is there a bookstore in town one said the lawyer henry williams s get there said mr bloom we re going to buy it henry williams was behind his counter his store was a small one containing a mixture of books stationery and fancy rubbish adjoining it was henry s home a decent cottage vine embowered and cosy henry was lank and soporific and not inclined to rush his business i want to buy your house and store said mr bloom i haven t got time to dicker name your price it s worth eight hundred said henry too much dazed to ask more than its value shut that door said mr bloom to the lawyer then he tore off his coat and vest and began to unbutton his shirt wanter fight about it do yer said henry williams jumping up and cracking his heels together twice all right hunky sail in and cut yer capers keep your clothes on said mr bloom i m only going down to the bank he drew eight one hundred dollar bills from his money belt and planked them down on the counter mr cooly showed signs of future promise for he already had the deed spread out and was reaching across the counter for the ink bottle never before or since was such quick action had in cold branch your name please asked the lawyer make it out to peyton blaylock said mr bloom god knows how to spell it within thirty minutes henry williams was out of business and mr bloom stood on the brick sidewalk with mr cooly who held in his hand the signed and attested deed you ll find the party at the pinetop inn said j pinkney bloom get it recorded and take it down and give it to him he ll ask you a hell s mint of questions so here s ten dollars for the trouble you ll have in not being able to answer em never run much to poetry did you young man well said the really talented cooly who even yet retained his right mind now and then dig into it said mr bloom it ll pay you never heard a poem now that run something like this did you a good thing out of nazareth comes up sometimes i guess on hand all right to help and cheer a sucker in distress i believe not said mr cooly it s a hymn said j pinkney bloom now show me the way to a livery stable son for i m going to hit the dirt road back to okochee confessions of a humorist there was a painless stage of incubation that lasted twenty five years and then it broke out on me and people said i was it but they called it humor instead of measles the employees in the store bought a silver inkstand for the senior partner on his fiftieth birthday we crowded into his private office to present it i had been selected for spokesman and i made a little speech that i had been preparing for a week it made a hit it was full of puns and epigrams and funny twists that brought down the house which was a very solid one in the wholesale hardware line old marlowe himself actually grinned and the employees took their cue and roared my reputation as a humorist dates from half past nine o clock on that morning for weeks afterward my fellow clerks fanned the flame of my self esteem one by one they came to me saying what an awfully clever speech that was old man and carefully explained to me the point of each one of my jokes gradually i found that i was expected to keep it up others might speak sanely on business matters and the day s topics but from me something gamesome and airy was required i was expected to crack jokes about the crockery and lighten up the granite ware with persiflage i was second bookkeeper and if i failed to show up a balance sheet without something comic about the footings or could find no cause for laughter in an invoice of plows the other clerks were disappointed by degrees my fame spread and i became a local character our town was small enough to make this possible the daily newspaper quoted me at social gatherings i was indispensable i believe i did possess considerable wit and a facility for quick and spontaneous repartee this gift i cultivated and improved by practice and the nature of it was kindly and genial not running to sarcasm or offending others people began to smile when they saw me coming and by the time we had met i generally had the word ready to broaden the smile into a laugh i had married early we had a charming boy of three and a girl of five naturally we lived in a vine covered cottage and were happy my salary as bookkeeper in the hardware concern kept at a distance those ills attendant upon superfluous wealth at sundry times i had written out a few jokes and conceits that i considered peculiarly happy and had sent them to certain periodicals that print such things all of them had been instantly accepted several of the editors had written to request further contributions one day i received a letter from the editor of a famous weekly publication he suggested that i submit to him a humorous composition to fill a column of space hinting that he would make it a regular feature of each issue if the work proved satisfactory i did so and at the end of two weeks he offered to make a contract with me for a year at a figure that was considerably higher than the amount paid me by the hardware firm i was filled with delight my wife already crowned me in her mind with the imperishable evergreens of literary success we had lobster croquettes and a bottle of blackberry wine for supper that night here was the chance to liberate myself from drudgery i talked over the matter very seriously with louisa we agreed that i must resign my place at the store and devote myself to humor i resigned my fellow clerks gave me a farewell banquet the speech i made there coruscated it was printed in full by the gazette the next morning i awoke and looked at the clock late by george i exclaimed and grabbed for my clothes louisa reminded me that i was no longer a slave to hardware and contractors supplies i was now a professional humorist after breakfast she proudly led me to the little room off the kitchen dear girl there was my table and chair writing pad ink and pipe tray and all the author s trappings the celery stand full of fresh roses and honeysuckle last year s calendar on the wall the dictionary and a little bag of chocolates to nibble between inspirations dear girl i sat me to work the wall paper is patterned with arabesques or odalisks or perhaps it is trapezoids upon one of the figures i fixed my eyes i bethought me of humor a voice startled me louisa s voice if you aren t too busy dear it said come to dinner i looked at my watch yes five hours had been gathered in by the grim scytheman i went to dinner you mustn t work too hard at first said louisa goethe or was it napoleon said five hours a day is enough for mental labor couldn t you take me and the children to the woods this afternoon i am a little tired i admitted so we went to the woods but i soon got the swing of it within a month i was turning out copy as regular as shipments of hardware and i had success my column in the weekly made some stir and i was referred to in a gossipy way by the critics as something fresh in the line of humorists i augmented my income considerably by contributing to other publications i picked up the tricks of the trade i could take a funny idea and make a two line joke of it earning a dollar with false whiskers on it would serve up cold as a quatrain doubling its producing value by turning the skirt and adding a ruffle of rhyme you would hardly recognize it as vers de societe with neatly shod feet and a fashion plate illustration i began to save up money and we had new carpets and a parlor organ my townspeople began to look upon me as a citizen of some consequence instead of the merry trifier i had been when i clerked in the hardware store after five or six months the spontaniety seemed to depart from my humor quips and droll sayings no longer fell carelessly from my lips i was sometimes hard run for material i found myself listening to catch available ideas from the conversation of my friends sometimes i chewed my pencil and gazed at the wall paper for hours trying to build up some gay little bubble of unstudied fun and then i became a harpy a moloch a jonah a vampire to my acquaintances anxious haggard greedy i stood among them like a veritable killjoy let a bright saying a witty comparison a piquant phrase fall from their lips and i was after it like a hound springing upon a bone i dared not trust my memory but turning aside guiltily and meanly i would make a note of it in my ever present memorandum book or upon my cuff for my own future use my friends regarded me in sorrow and wonder i was not the same man where once i had furnished them entertainment and jollity i now preyed upon them no jests from me ever bid for their smiles now they were too precious i could not afford to dispense gratuitously the means of my livelihood i was a lugubrious fox praising the singing of my friends the crow s that they might drop from their beaks the morsels of wit that i coveted nearly every one began to avoid me i even forgot how to smile not even paying that much for the sayings i appropriated no persons places times or subjects were exempt from my plundering in search of material even in church my demoralized fancy went hunting among the solemn aisles and pillars for spoil did the minister give out the long meter doxology at once i began doxology sockdology sockdolager meter meet her the sermon ran through my mental sieve its precepts filtering unheeded could i but glean a suggestion of a pun or a bon mot the solemnest anthems of the choir were but an accompaniment to my thoughts as i conceived new changes to ring upon the ancient comicalities concerning the jealousies of soprano tenor and basso my own home became a hunting ground my wife is a singularly feminine creature candid sympathetic and impulsive once her conversation was my delight and her ideas a source of unfailing pleasure now i worked her she was a gold mine of those amusing but lovable inconsistencies that distinguish the female mind i began to market those pearls of unwisdom and humor that should have enriched only the sacred precincts of home with devilish cunning i encouraged her to talk unsuspecting she laid her heart bare upon the cold conspicuous common printed page i offered it to the public gaze a literary judas i kissed her and betrayed her for pieces of silver i dressed her sweet confidences in the pantalettes and frills of folly and made them dance in the market place dear louisa of nights i have bent over her cruel as a wolf above a tender lamb hearkening even to her soft words murmured in sleep hoping to catch an idea for my next day s grind there is worse to come god help me next my fangs were buried deep in the neck of the fugitive sayings of my little children guy and viola were two bright fountains of childish quaint thoughts and speeches i found a ready sale for this kind of humor and was furnishing a regular department in a magazine with funny fancies of childhood i began to stalk them as an indian stalks the antelope i would hide behind sofas and doors or crawl on my hands and knees among the bushes in the yard to eavesdrop while they were at play i had all the qualities of a harpy except remorse once when i was barren of ideas and my copy must leave in the next mail i covered myself in a pile of autumn leaves in the yard where i knew they intended to come to play i cannot bring myself to believe that guy was aware of my hiding place but even if he was i would be loath to blame him for his setting fire to the leaves causing the destruction of my new suit of clothes and nearly cremating a parent soon my own children began to shun me as a pest often when i was creeping upon them like a melancholy ghoul i would hear them say to each other here comes papa and they would gather their toys and scurry away to some safer hiding place miserable wretch that i was and yet i was doing well financially before the first year had passed i had saved a thousand dollars and we had lived in comfort but at what a cost i am not quite clear as to what a pariah is but i was everything that it sounds like i had no friends no amusements no enjoyment of life the happiness of my family had been sacrificed i was a bee sucking sordid honey from life s fairest flowers dreaded and shunned on account of my stingo one day a man spoke to me with a pleasant and friendly smile not in months had the thing happened i was passing the undertaking establishment of peter heffelbower peter stood in the door and saluted me i stopped strangely wrung in my heart by his greeting he asked me inside the day was chill and rainy we went into the back room where a fire burned in a little stove a customer came and peter left me alone for a while presently i felt a new feeling stealing over me a sense of beautiful calm and content i looked around the place there were rows of shining rosewood caskets black palls trestles hearse plumes mourning streamers and all the paraphernalia of the solemn trade here was peace order silence the abode of grave and dignified reflections here on the brink of life was a little niche pervaded by the spirit of eternal rest when i entered it the follies of the world abandoned me at the door i felt no inclination to wrest a humorous idea from those sombre and stately trappings my mind seemed to stretch itself to grateful repose upon a couch draped with gentle thoughts a quarter of an hour ago i was an abandoned humorist now i was a philosopher full of serenity and ease i had found a refuge from humor from the hot chase of the shy quip from the degrading pursuit of the panting joke from the restless reach after the nimble repartee i had not known heffelbower well when he came back i let him talk fearful that he might prove to be a jarring note in the sweet dirgelike harmony of his establishment but no he chimed truly i gave a long sigh of happiness never have i known a man s talk to be as magnificently dull as peter s was compared with it the dead sea is a geyser never a sparkle or a glimmer of wit marred his words commonplaces as trite and as plentiful as blackberries flowed from his lips no more stirring in quality than a last week s tape running from a ticker quaking a little i tried upon him one of my best pointed jokes it fell back ineffectual with the point broken i loved that man from then on two or three evenings each week i would steal down to heffelbower s and revel in his back room that was my only joy i began to rise early and hurry through my work that i might spend more time in my haven in no other place could i throw off my habit of extracting humorous ideas from my surroundings peter s talk left me no opening had i besieged it ever so hard under this influence i began to improve in spirits it was the recreation from one s labor which every man needs i surprised one or two of my former friends by throwing them a smile and a cheery word as i passed them on the streets several times i dumfounded my family by relaxing long enough to make a jocose remark in their presence i had so long been ridden by the incubus of humor that i seized my hours of holiday with a schoolboy s zest mv work began to suffer it was not the pain and burden to me that it had been i often whistled at my desk and wrote with far more fluency than before i accomplished my tasks impatiently as anxious to be off to my helpful retreat as a drunkard is to get to his tavern my wife had some anxious hours in conjecturing where i spent my afternoons i thought it best not to tell her women do not understand these things poor girl she had one shock out of it one day i brought home a silver coffin handle for a paper weight and a fine fluffy hearse plume to dust my papers with i loved to see them on my desk and think of the beloved back room down at heffelbower s but louisa found them and she shrieked with horror i had to console her with some lame excuse for having them but i saw in her eyes that the prejudice was not removed i had to remove the articles though at double quick time one day peter heffelbower laid before me a temptation that swept me off my feet in his sensible uninspired way he showed me his books and explained that his profits and his business were increasing rapidly he had thought of taking in a partner with some cash he would rather have me than any one he knew when i left his place that afternoon peter had my check for the thousand dollars i had in the bank and i was a partner in his undertaking business i went home with feelings of delirious joy mingled with a certain amount of doubt i was dreading to tell my wife about it but i walked on air to give up the writing of humorous stuff once more to enjoy the apples of life instead of squeezing them to a pulp for a few drops of hard cider to make the pubic feel funny what a boon that would be at the supper table louisa handed me some letters that had come during my absence several of them contained rejected manuscript ever since i first began going to heffelbower s my stuff had been coming back with alarming frequency lately i had been dashing off my jokes and articles with the greatest fluency previously i had labored like a bricklayer slowly and with agony presently i opened a letter from the editor of the weekly with which i had a regular contract the checks for that weekly article were still our main dependence the letter ran thus dear sir as you are aware our contract for the year expires with the present month while regretting the necessity for so doing we must say that we do not care to renew same for the coming year we were quite pleased with your style of humor which seems to have delighted quite a large proportion of our readers but for the past two months we have noticed a decided falling off in its quality your earlier work showed a spontaneous easy natural flow of fun and wit of late it is labored studied and unconvincing giving painful evidence of hard toil and drudging mechanism again regretting that we do not consider your contributions available any longer we are yours sincerely the editor i handed this letter to my wife after she had read it her face grew extremely long and there were tears in her eyes the mean old thing she exclaimed indignantly i m sure your pieces are just as good as they ever were and it doesn t take you half as long to write them as it did and then i suppose louisa thought of the checks that would cease coming oh john she wailed what will you do now for an answer i got up and began to do a polka step around the supper table i am sure louisa thought the trouble had driven me mad and i think the children hoped it had for they tore after me yelling with glee and emulating my steps i was now something like their old playmate as of yore the theatre for us to night i shouted nothing less and a late wild disreputable supper for all of us at the palace restaurant lumpty diddle de dee de dum and then i explained my glee by declaring that i was now a partner in a prosperous undertaking establishment and that written jokes might go hide their heads in sackcloth and ashes for all me with the editor s letter in her hand to justify the deed i had done my wife could advance no objections save a few mild ones based on the feminine inability to appreciate a good thing such as the little back room of peter hef no of heffelbower co s undertaking establishment in conclusion i will say that to day you will find no man in our town as well liked as jovial and full of merry sayings as i my jokes are again noised about and quoted once more i take pleasure in my wife s confidential chatter without a mercenary thought while guy and viola play at my feet distributing gems of childish humor without fear of the ghastly tormentor who used to dog their steps notebook in hand our business has prospered finely i keep the books and look after the shop while peter attends to outside matters he says that my levity and high spirits would simply turn any funeral into a regular irish wake the sparrows in madison square the young man in straitened circumstances who comes to new york city to enter literature has but one thing to do provided he has studied carefully his field in advance he must go straight to madison square write an article about the sparrows there and sell it to the sun for i cannot recall either a novel or a story dealing with the popular theme of the young writer from the provinces who comes to the metropolis to win fame and fortune with his pen in which the hero does not get his start that way it does seem strange that some author in casting about for startlingly original plots has not hit upon the idea of having his hero write about the bluebirds in union square and sell it to the herald but a search through the files of metropolitan fiction counts up overwhelmingly for the sparrows and the old garden square and the sun always writes the check of course it is easy to understand why this first city venture of the budding author is always successful he is primed by necessity to a superlative effort mid the iron and stone and marble of the roaring city he has found this spot of singing birds and green grass and trees every tender sentiment in his nature is baffling with the sweet pain of homesickness his genius is aroused as it never may be again the birds chirp the tree branches sway the noise of wheels is forgotten he writes with his soul in his pen and he sells it to the sun for i had read of this custom during many years before i came to new york when my friends were using their strongest arguments to dissuade me from coming i only smiled serenely they did not know of that sparrow graft i had up my sleeve when i arrived in new york and the car took me straight from the ferry up twenty third street to madison square i could hear that check rustling in my inside pocket i obtained lodging at an unhyphenated hostelry and the next morning i was on a bench in madison square almost by the time the sparrows were awake their melodious chirping the benignant spring foliage of the noble trees and the clean fragrant grass reminded me so potently of the old farm i had left that tears almost came into my eyes then all in a moment i felt my inspiration the brave piercing notes of those cheerful small birds formed a keynote to a wonderful light fanciful song of hope and joy and altruism like myself they were creatures with hearts pitched to the tune of woods and fields as i was so were they captives by circumstance in the discordant dull city yet with how much grace and glee they bore the restraint and then the early morning people began to pass through the square to their work sullen people with sidelong glances and glum faces hurrying hurrying hurrying and i got my theme cut out clear from the bird notes and wrought it into a lesson and a poem and a carnival dance and a lullaby and then translated it all into prose and began to write for two hours my pencil traveled over my pad with scarcely a rest then i went to the little room i had rented for two days and there i cut it to half and then mailed it white hot to the sun the next morning i was up by daylight and spent two cents of my capital for a paper if the word sparrow was in it i was unable to find it i took it up to my room and spread it out on the bed and went over it column by column something was wrong three hours afterward the postman brought me a large envelope containing my ms and a piece of inexpensive paper about inches by i suppose some of you have seen them upon which was written in violet ink with the sun s thanks i went over to the square and sat upon a bench no i did not think it necessary to eat any breakfast that morning the confounded pests of sparrows were making the square hideous with their idiotic cheep cheep i never saw birds so persistently noisy impudent and disagreeable in all my life by this time according to all traditions i should have been standing in the office of the editor of the sun that personage a tall grave white haired man would strike a silver bell as he grasped my hand and wiped a suspicious moisture from his glasses mr mcchesney he would be saying when a subordinate appeared this is mr henry the young man who sent in that exquisite gem about the sparrows in madison square you may give him a desk at once your salary sir will be a week to begin with this was what i had been led to expect by all writers who have evolved romances of literary new york something was decidedly wrong with tradition i could not assume the blame so i fixed it upon the sparrows i began to hate them with intensity and heat at that moment an individual wearing an excess of whiskers two hats and a pestilential air slid into the seat beside me say willie he muttered cajolingly could you cough up a dime out of your coffers for a cup of coffee this morning i m lung weary my friend said i the best i can do is three cents and you look like a gentleman too said he what brung you down boozer birds i said fiercely the brown throated songsters carolling songs of hope and cheer to weary man toiling amid the city s dust and din the little feathered couriers from the meadows and woods chirping sweetly to us of blue skies and flowering fields the confounded little squint eyed nuisances yawping like a flock of steam pianos and stuffing themselves like aldermen with grass seeds and bugs while a man sits on a bench and goes without his breakfast yes sir birds look at them as i spoke i picked up a dead tree branch that lay by the bench and hurled it with all my force into a close congregation of the sparrows on the grass the flock flew to the trees with a babel of shrill cries but two of them remained prostrate upon the turf in a moment my unsavory friend had leaped over the row of benches and secured the fluttering victims which he thrust hurriedly into his pockets then he beckoned me with a dirty forefinger come on cully he said hoarsely you re in on the feed thank you very much weakly i followed my dingy acquaintance he led me away from the park down a side street and through a crack in a fence into a vacant lot where some excavating had been going on behind a pile of old stones and lumber he paused and took out his birds i got matches said he you got any paper to start a fire with i drew forth my manuscript story of the sparrows and offered it for burnt sacrifice there were old planks splinters and chips for our fire my frowsy friend produced from some interior of his frayed clothing half a loaf of bread pepper and salt in ten minutes each of us was holding a sparrow spitted upon a stick over the leaping flames say said my fellow bivouacker this ain t so bad when a fellow s hungry it reminds me of when i struck new york first about fifteen years ago i come in from the west to see if i could get a job on a newspaper i hit the madison square park the first mornin after and was sitting around on the benches i noticed the sparrows chirpin and the grass and trees so nice and green that i thought i was back in the country again then i got some papers out of my pocket and i know i interrupted you sent it to the sun and got say said my friend suspiciously you seem to know a good deal where was you i went to sleep on the bench there in the sun and somebody touched me for every cent i had hearts and hands at denver there was an influx of passengers into the coaches on the eastbound b m express in one coach there sat a very pretty young woman dressed in elegant taste and surrounded by all the luxurious comforts of an experienced traveler among the newcomers were two young men one of handsome presence with a bold frank countenance and manner the other a ruffled glum faced person heavily built and roughly dressed the two were handcuffed together as they passed down the aisle of the coach the only vacant seat offered was a reversed one facing the attractive young woman here the linked couple seated themselves the young woman s glance fell upon them with a distant swift disinterest then with a lovely smile brightening her countenance and a tender pink tingeing her rounded cheeks she held out a little gray gloved hand when she spoke her voice full sweet and deliberate proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard well mr easton if you will make me speak first i suppose i must don t vou ever recognize old friends when you meet them in the west the younger man roused himself sharply at the sound of her voice seemed to struggle with a slight embarrassment which he threw off instantly and then clasped her fingers with his left hand it s miss fairchild he said with a smile i ll ask you to excuse the other hand it s otherwise engaged just at present he slightly raised his right hand bound at the wrist by the shining bracelet to the left one of his companion the glad look in the girl s eyes slowly changed to a bewildered horror the glow faded from her cheeks her lips parted in a vague relaxing distress easton with a little laugh as if amused was about to speak again when the other forestalled him the glum faced man had been watching the girl s countenance with veiled glances from his keen shrewd eyes you ll excuse me for speaking miss but i see you re acquainted with the marshall here if you ll ask him to speak a word for me when we get to the pen he ll do it and it ll make things easier for me there he s taking me to leavenworth prison it s seven years for counterfeiting oh said the girl with a deep breath and returning color so that is what you are doing out here a marshal my dear miss fairchild said easton calmly i had to do something money has a way of taking wings unto itself and you know it takes money to keep step with our crowd in washington i saw this opening in the west and well a marshalship isn t quite as high a position as that of ambassador but the ambassador said the girl warmly doesn t call any more he needn t ever have done so you ought to know that and so now you are one of these dashing western heroes and you ride and shoot and go into all kinds of dangers that s different from the washington life you have been missed from the old crowd the girl s eyes fascinated went back widening a little to rest upon the glittering handcuffs don t you worry about them miss said the other man all marshals handcuff themselves to their prisoners to keep them from getting away mr easton knows his business will we see you again soon in washington asked the girl not soon i think said easton my butterfly days are over i fear i love the west said the girl irrelevantly her eyes were shining softly she looked away out the car window she began to speak truly and simply without the gloss of style and manner mamma and i spent the summer in denver she went home a week ago because father was slightly ill i could live and be happy in the west i think the air here agrees with me money isn t everything but people always misunderstand things and remain stupid say mr marshal growled the glum faced man this isn t quite fair i m needing a drink and haven t had a smoke all day haven t you talked long enough take me in the smoker now won t you i m half dead for a pipe the bound travelers rose to their feet easton with the same slow smile on his face i can t deny a petition for tobacco he said lightly it s the one friend of the unfortunate good bye miss fairchild duty calls you know he held out his hand for a farewell it s too bad you are not going east she said reclothing herself with manner and style but you must go on to leavenworth i suppose yes said easton i must go on to leavenworth the two men sidled down the aisle into the smoker the two passengers in a seat near by had heard most of the conversation said one of them that marshal s a good sort of chap some of these western fellows are all right pretty young to hold an office like that isn t he asked the other young exclaimed the first speaker why oh didn t you catch on say did you ever know an officer to handcuff a prisoner to his right hand the cactus the most notable thing about time is that it is so purely relative a large amount of reminiscence is by common consent conceded to the drowning man and it is not past belief that one may review an entire courtship while removing one s gloves that is what trysdale was doing standing by a table in his bachelor apartments on the table stood a singular looking green plant in a red earthen jar the plant was one of the species of cacti and was provided with long tentacular leaves that perpetually swayed with the slightest breeze with a peculiar beckoning motion trysdale s friend the brother of the bride stood at a sideboard complaining at being allowed to drink alone both men were in evening dress white favors like stars upon their coats shone through the gloom of the apartment as he slowly unbuttoned his gloves there passed through trysdale s mind a swift scarifying retrospect of the last few hours it seemed that in his nostrils was still the scent of the flowers that had been banked in odorous masses about the church and in his ears the lowpitched hum of a thousand well bred voices the rustle of crisp garments and most insistently recurring the drawling words of the minister irrevocably binding her to another from this last hopeless point of view he still strove as if it had become a habit of his mind to reach some conjecture as to why and how he had lost her shaken rudely by the uncompromising fact he had suddenly found himself confronted by a thing he had never before faced his own innermost unmitigated arid unbedecked self he saw all the garbs of pretence and egoism that he had worn now turn to rags of folly he shuddered at the thought that to others before now the garments of his soul must have appeared sorry and threadbare vanity and conceit these were the joints in his armor and how free from either she had always been but why as she had slowly moved up the aisle toward the altar he had felt an unworthy sullen exultation that had served to support him he had told himself that her paleness was from thoughts of another than the man to whom she was about to give herself but even that poor consolation had been wrenched from him for when he saw that swift limpid upward look that she gave the man when he took her hand he knew himself to be forgotten once that same look had been raised to him and he had gauged its meaning indeed his conceit had crumbled its last prop was gone why had it ended thus there had been no quarrel between them nothing for the thousandth time he remarshalled in his mind the events of those last few days before the tide had so suddenly turned she had always insisted upon placing him upon a pedestal and he had accepted her homage with royal grandeur it had been a very sweet incense that she had burned before him so modest he told himself so childlike and worshipful and he would once have sworn so sincere she had invested him with an almost supernatural number of high attributes and excellencies and talents and he had absorbed the oblation as a desert drinks the rain that can coax from it no promise of blossom or fruit as trysdale grimly wrenched apart the seam of his last glove the crowning instance of his fatuous and tardily mourned egoism came vividly back to him the scene was the night when he had asked her to come up on his pedestal with him and share his greatness he could not now for the pain of it allow his mind to dwell upon the memory of her convincing beauty that night the careless wave of her hair the tenderness and virginal charm of her looks and words but they had been enough and they had brought him to speak during their conversation she had said and captain carruthers tells me that you speak the spanish language like a native why have you hidden this accomplishment from me is there anything you do not know now carruthers was an idiot no doubt he trysdale had been guilty he sometimes did such things of airing at the club some old canting castilian proverb dug from the hotchpotch at the back of dictionaries carruthers who was one of his incontinent admirers was the very man to have magnified this exhibition of doubtful erudition but alas the incense of her admiration had been so sweet and flattering he allowed the imputation to pass without denial without protest he allowed her to twine about his brow this spurious bay of spanish scholarship he let it grace his conquering head and among its soft convolutions he did not feel the prick of the thorn that was to pierce him later how glad how shy how tremulous she was how she fluttered like a snared bird when he laid his mightiness at her feet he could have sworn and he could swear now that unmistakable consent was in her eyes but coyly she would give him no direct answer i will send you my answer to morrow she said and he the indulgent confident victor smilingly granted the delay the next day he waited impatient in his rooms for the word at noon her groom came to the door and left the strange cactus in the red earthen jar there was no note no message merely a tag upon the plant bearing a barbarous foreign or botanical name he waited until night but her answer did not come his large pride and hurt vanity kept him from seeking her two evenings later they met at a dinner their greetings were conventional but she looked at him breathless wondering eager he was courteous adamant waiting her explanation with womanly swiftness she took her cue from his manner and turned to snow and ice thus and wider from this on they had drifted apart where was his fault who had been to blame humbled now he sought the answer amid the ruins of his self conceit if the voice of the other man in the room querulously intruding upon his thoughts aroused him i say trysdale what the deuce is the matter with you you look unhappy as if you yourself had been married instead of having acted merely as an accomplice look at me another accessory come two thousand miles on a garlicky cockroachy banana steamer all the way from south america to connive at the sacrifice please to observe how lightly my guilt rests upon my shoulders only little sister i had too and now she s gone come now take something to ease your conscience i don t drink just now thanks said trysdale your brandy resumed the other coming over and joining him is abominable run down to see me some time at punta redonda and try some of our stuff that old garcia smuggles in it s worth the trip hallo here s an old acquaintance wherever did you rake up this cactus trysdale a present said trysdale from a friend know the species very well it s a tropical concern see hundreds of em around punta every day here s the name on this tag tied to it know any spanish trysdale no said trysdale with the bitter wraith of a smile is it spanish yes the natives imagine the leaves are reaching out and beckoning to you they call it by this name ventomarme name means in english come and take me the detective detector i was walking in central park with avery knight the great new york burglar highwayman and murderer but my dear knight said i it sounds incredible you have undoubtedly performed some of the most wonderful feats in your profession known to modern crime you have committed some marvellous deeds under the very noses of the police you have boldly entered the homes of millionaires and held them up with an empty gun while you made free with their silver and jewels you have sandbagged citizens in the glare of broadway s electric lights you have killed and robbed with superb openness and absolute impunity but when you boast that within forty eight hours after committing a murder you can run down and actually bring me face to face with the detective assigned to apprehend you i must beg leave to express my doubts remember you are in new york avery knight smiled indulgently you pique my professional pride doctor he said in a nettled tone i will convince you about twelve yards in advance of us a prosperous looking citizen was rounding a clump of bushes where the walk curved knight suddenly drew a revolver and shot the man in the back his victim fell and lay without moving the great murderer went up to him leisurely and took from his clothes his money watch and a valuable ring and cravat pin he then rejoined me smiling calmly and we continued our walk ten steps and we met a policeman running toward the spot where the shot had been fired avery knight stopped him i have just killed a man he announced seriously and robbed him of his possessions g wan said the policeman angrily or i ll run yez in want yer name in the papers don t yez i never knew the cranks to come around so quick after a shootin before out of th park now for yours or i ll fan yez what you have done i said argumentatively as knight and i walked on was easy but when you come to the task of hunting down the detective that they send upon your trail you will find that you have undertaken a difficult feat perhaps so said knight lightly i will admit that my success depends in a degree upon the sort of man they start after me if it should be an ordinary plain clothes man i might fail to gain a sight of him if they honor me by giving the case to some one of their celebrated sleuths i do not fear to match my cunning and powers of induction against his on the next afternoon knight entered my office with a satisfied look on his keen countenance how goes the mysterious murder i asked as usual said knight smilingly i have put in the morning at the police station and at the inquest it seems that a card case of mine containing cards with my name and address was found near the body they have three witnesses who saw the shooting and gave a description of me the case has been placed in the hands of shamrock jolnes the famous detective he left headquarters at on the assignment i waited at my address until two thinking he might call there i laughed tauntingly you will never see jolnes i continued until this murder has been forgotten two or three weeks from now i had a better opinion of your shrewdness knight during the three hours and a half that you waited he has got out of your ken he is after you on true induction theories now and no wrongdoer has yet been known to come upon him while thus engaged i advise you to give it up doctor said knight with a sudden glint in his keen gray eye and a squaring of his chin in spite of the record your city holds of something like a dozen homicides without a subsequent meeting of the perpetrator and the sleuth in charge of the case i will undertake to break that record to morrow i will take you to shamrock jolnes i will unmask him before you and prove to you that it is not an impossibility for an officer of the law and a manslayer to stand face to face in your city do it said i and you ll have the sincere thanks of the police department on the next day knight called for me in a cab i ve been on one or two false scents doctor he admitted i know something of detectives methods and i followed out a few of them expecting to find jolnes at the other end the pistol being a caliber i thought surely i would find him at work on the clue in forty fifth street then again i looked for the detective at the columbia university as the man s being shot in the back naturally suggested hazing but i could not find a trace of him nor will you i said emphatically not by ordinary methods said knight i might walk up and down broadway for a month without success but you have aroused my pride doctor and if i fail to show you shamrock jolnes this day i promise you i will never kill or rob in your city again nonsense man i replied when our burglars walk into our houses and politely demand thousands of dollars worth of jewels and then dine and bang the piano an hour or two before leaving how do you a mere murderer expect to come in contact with the detective that is looking for you avery knight sat lost in thought for a while at length he looked up brightly doc said he i have it put on your hat and come with me in half an hour i guarantee that you shall stand in the presence of shamrock jolnes i entered a cab with avery knight i did not hear his instructions to the driver but the vehicle set out at a smart pace up broadway turning presently into fifth avenue and proceeding northward again it was with a rapidly beating heart that i accompanied this wonderful and gifted assassin whose analytical genius and superb self confidence had prompted him to make me the tremendous promise of bringing me into the presence of a murderer and the new york detective in pursuit of him simultaneously even yet i could not believe it possible are you sure that you are not being led into some trap i asked suppose that your clue whatever it is should bring us only into the presence of the commissioner of police and a couple of dozen cops my dear doctor said knight a little stiffly i would remind you that i am no gambler i beg your pardon said i but i do not think you will find jolnes the cab stopped before one of the handsomest residences on the avenue walking up and down in front of the house was a man with long red whiskers with a detective s badge showing on the lapel of his coat now and then the man would remove his whiskers to wipe his face and then i would recognize at once the well known features of the great new york detective jolnes was keeping a sharp watch upon the doors and windows of the house well doctor said knight unable to repress a note of triumph in his voice have you seen it is wonderful wonderful i could not help exclaiming as our cab started on its return trip but how did you do it by what process of induction my dear doctor interrupted the great murderer the inductive theory is what the detectives use my process is more modern i call it the saltatorial theory without bothering with the tedious mental phenomena necessary to the solution of a mystery from slight clues i jump at once to a conclusion i will explain to you the method i employed in this case in the first place i argued that as the crime was committed in new york city in broad daylight in a public place and under peculiarly atrocious circumstances and that as the most skilful sleuth available was let loose upon the case the perpetrator would never be discovered do you not think my postulation justified by precedent perhaps so i replied doggedly but if big bill dev stop that interrupted knight with a smile i ve heard that several times it s too late now i will proceed if homicides in new york went undiscovered i reasoned although the best detective talent was employed to ferret them out it must be true that the detectives went about their work in the wrong way and not only in the wrong way but exactly opposite from the right way that was my clue i slew the man in central park now let me describe myself to you i am tall with a black beard and i hate publicity i have no money to speak of i do not like oatmeal and it is the one ambition of my life to die rich i am of a cold and heartless disposition i do not care for my fellowmen and i never give a cent to beggars or charity now my dear doctor that is the true description of myself the man whom that shrewd detective was to hunt down you who are familiar with the history of crime in new york of late should be able to foretell the result when i promised you to exhibit to your incredulous gaze the sleuth who was set upon me you laughed at me because you said that detectives and murderers never met in new york i have demonstrated to you that the theory is possible but how did you do it i asked again it was very simple replied the distinguished murderer i assumed that the detective would go exactly opposite to the clues he had i have given you a description of myself therefore he must necessarily set to work and trail a short man with a white beard who likes to be in the papers who is very wealthy is fond of oatmeal wants to die poor and is of an extremely generous and philanthropic disposition when thus far is reached the mind hesitates no longer i conveyed you at once to the spot where shamrock jolnes was piping off andrew carnegie s residence knight said i you re a wonder if there was no danger of your reforming what a rounds man you d make for the nineteenth precinct the dog and the playlet this story has been rewritten and published in strictly business under the title the proof of the pudding usually it is a cold day in july when you can stroll up broadway in that month and get a story out of the drama i found one a few breathless parboiling days ago and it seems to decide a serious question in art there was not a soul left in the city except hollis and me and two or three million sunworshippers who remained at desks and counters the elect had fled to seashore lake and mountain and had already begun to draw for additional funds every evening hollis and i prowled about the deserted town searching for coolness in empty cafes dining rooms and roofgardens we knew to the tenth part of a revolution the speed of every electric fan in gotham and we followed the swiftest as they varied hollis s fiancee miss loris sherman had been in the adirondacks at lower saranac lake for a month in another week he would join her party there in the meantime he cursed the city cheerfully and optimistically and sought my society because i suffered him to show me her photograph during the black coffee every time we dined together my revenge was to read to him my one act play it was one insufferable evening when the overplus of the day s heat was being hurled quiveringly back to the heavens by every surcharged brick and stone and inch of iron in the panting town but with the cunning of the two legged beasts we had found an oasis where the hoofs of apollo s steed had not been allowed to strike our seats were on an ocean of cool polished oak the white linen of fifty deserted tables flapped like seagulls in the artificial breeze a mile away a waiter lingered for a heliographic signal we might have roared songs there or fought a duel without molestation out came miss loris s photo with the coffee and i once more praised the elegant poise of the neck the extremely low coiled mass of heavy hair and the eyes that followed one like those in an oil painting she s the greatest ever said hollis with enthusiasm good as great northern preferred and a disposition built like a watch one week more and i ll be happy jonny on the spot old tom tolliver my best college chum went up there two weeks ago he writes me that loris doesn t talk about anything but me oh i guess rip van winkle didn t have all the good luck yes yes said i hurriedly pulling out my typewritten play she s no doubt a charming girl now here s that little curtain raiser you promised to listen to ever been tried on the stage asked hollis not exactly i answered i read half of it the other day to a fellow whose brother knows robert edeson but he had to catch a train before i finished go on said hollis sliding back in his chair like a good fellow i m no stage carpenter but i ll tell you what i think of it from a first row balcony standpoint i m a theatre bug during the season and i can size up a fake play almost as quick as the gallery can flag the waiter once more and then go ahead as hard as you like with it i ll be the dog i read my little play lovingly and i fear not without some elocution there was one scene in it that i believed in greatly the comedy swiftly rises into thrilling and unexpectedly developed drama capt marchmont suddenly becomes cognizant that his wife is an unscrupulous adventuress who has deceived him from the day of their first meeting the rapid and mortal duel between them from that moment she with her magnificent lies and siren charm winding about him like a serpent trying to recover her lost ground he with his man s agony and scorn and lost faith trying to tear her from his heart that scene i always thought was a crackerjack when capt marchmont discovers her duplicity by reading on a blotter in a mirror the impression of a note that she has written to the count he raises his hand to heaven and exclaims o god who created woman while adam slept and gave her to him for a companion take back thy gift and return instead the sleep though it last forever rot said hollis rudely when i had given those lines with proper emphasis i beg your pardon i said as sweetly as i could come now went on hollis don t be an idiot you know very well that nobody spouts any stuff like that these days that sketch went along all right until you rang in the skyrockets cut out that right arm exercise and the adam and eve stunt and make your captain talk as you or i or bill jones would i ll admit said i earnestly for my theory was being touched upon that on all ordinary occasions all of us use commonplace language to convey our thoughts you will rememberthat up to the moment when the captain makes his terrible discovery all the characters on the stage talk pretty much as they would in real life but i believe that i am right in allowing him lines suitable to the strong and tragic situation into which he falls tragic my eye said my friend irreverently in shakespeare s day he might have sputtered out some high cockalorum nonsense of that sort because in those days they ordered ham and eggs in blank verse and discharged the cook with an epic but not for b way in the summer of it is my opinion said i that great human emotions shake up our vocabulary and leave the words best suited to express them on top a sudden violent grief or loss or disappointment will bring expressions out of an ordinary man as strong and solemn and dramatic as those used in fiction or on the stage to portray those emotions that s where you fellows are wrong said hollis plain every day talk is what goes your captain would very likely have kicked the cat lit a cigar stirred up a highball and telephoned for a lawyer instead of getting off those robert mantell pyrotechnics possibly a little later i continued but just at the time just as the blow is delivered if something scriptural or theatrical and deep tongued isn t wrung from a man in spite of his modern and practical way of speaking then i m wrong of course said hollis kindly you ve got to whoop her up some degrees for the stage the audience expects it when the villain kidnaps little effie you have to make her mother claw some chunks out of the atmosphere and scream me chee ild me chee ild what she would actually do would be to call up the police by phone ring for some strong tea and get the little darling s photo out ready for the reporters when you get your villain in a corner a stage corner it s all right for him to clap his hand to his forehead and hiss all is lost off the stage he would remark this is a conspiracy against me i refer you to my lawyers i get no consolation said i gloomily from your concession of an accentuated stage treatment in my play i fondly hoped that i was following life if people in real life meet great crises in a commonplace way they should do the same on the stage and then we drifted like two trout out of our cool pool in the great hotel and began to nibble languidly at the gay flies in the swift current of broadway and our question of dramatic art was unsettled we nibbled at the flies and avoided the hooks as wise trout do but soon the weariness of manhattan in summer overcame us nine stories up facing the south was hollis s apartment and we soon stepped into an elevator bound for that cooler haven i was familiar in those quarters and quickly my play was forgotten and i stood at a sideboard mixing things with cracked ice and glasses all about me a breeze from the bay came in the windows not altogether blighted by the asphalt furnace over which it had passed hollis whistling softly turned over a late arrived letter or two on his table and drew around the coolest wicker armchairs i was just measuring the vermouth carefully when i heard a sound some man s voice groaned hoarsely false oh god false and love is a lie and friendship but the byword of devils i looked around quickly hollis lay across the table with his head down upon his outstretched arms and then he looked up at me and laughed in his ordinary manner i knew him he was poking fun at me about my theory and it did seem so unnatural those swelling words during our quiet gossip that i half began to believe i had been mistaken that my theory was wrong hollis raised himself slowly from the table you were right about that theatrical business old man he said quietly as he tossed a note to me i read it loris had run away with tom tolliver a little talk about mobs i see remarked the tall gentleman in the frock coat and black slouch hat that another street car motorman in your city has narrowly excaped lynching at the hands of an infuriated mob by lighting a cigar and walking a couple of blocks down the street do you think they would have lynched him asked the new yorker in the next seat of the ferry station who was also waiting for the boat not until after the election said the tall man cutting a corner off his plug of tobacco i ve been in your city long enough to know something about your mobs the motorman s mob is about the least dangerous of them all except the national guard and the dressmakers convention you see when little willie goldstein is sent by his mother for pigs knuckles with a nickel tightly grasped in his chubby fist he always crosses the street car track safely twenty feet ahead of the car and then suddenly turns back to ask his inother whether it was pale ale or a spool of white cotton that she wanted the motorman yells and throws himself on the brakes like a football player there is a horrible grinding and then a ripping sound and a piercing shriek and willie is sitting with part of his trousers torn away by the fender screaming for his lost nickel in ten seconds the car is surrounded by infuriated citizens crying lynch the motorman lynch the motorman at the top of their voices some of them run to the nearest cigar store to get a rope but they find the last one has just been cut up and labelled hundreds of the excited mob press close to the cowering motorman whose hand is observed to tremble perceptibly as he transfers a stick of pepsin gum from his pocket to his mouth when the bloodthirsty mob of maddened citizens has closed in on the motorman some bringing camp stools and sitting quite close to him and all shouting lynch him policeman fogarty forces his way through them to the side of their prospective victim hello mike says the motorman in a low voice nice day shall i sneak off a block or so or would you like to rescue me well jerry if you don t mind says the policeman i d like to disperse the infuriated mob singlehanded i haven t defeated a lynching mob since last tuesday and that was a small one of only that wanted to string up a dago boy for selling wormy pears it would boost me some down at the station all right mike says the motorman anything to oblige i ll turn pale and tremble and he does so and policeman fogarty draws his club and says g wan wid yez and in eight seconds the desperate mob has scattered and gone about its business except about a hundred who remain to search for willie s nickel i never heard of a mob in our city doing violence to a motorman because of an accident said the new yorker you are not liable to said the tall man they know the motorman s all right and that he wouldn t even run over a stray dog if he could help it and they know that not a man among em would tie the knot to hang even a thomas cat that had been tried and condemned and sentenced according to law then why do they become infuriated and make threats of lynching asked the new yorker to assure the motorman answered the tall man that he is safe if they really wanted to do him up they would go into the houses and drop bricks on him from the third story windows new yorkers are not cowards said the other man a little stiffly not one at a time agreed the tall man promptly you ve got a fine lot of single handed scrappers in your town i d rather fight three of you than one and i d go up against all the gas trust s victims in a bunch before i d pass two citizens on a dark corner with my watch chain showing when you get rounded up in a bunch you lose your nerve get you in crowds and you re easy ask the l road guards and george b cortelyou and the tintype booths at coney island divided you stand united you fall e pluribus nihil whenever one of your mobs surrounds a man and begins to holler lynch him he says to himself oh dear i suppose i must look pale to please the boys but i will forsooth let my life insurance premium lapse to morrow this is a sure tip for me to play methuselah straight across the board in the next handicap i can imagine the tortured feelings of a prisoner in the hands of new york policemen when an infuriated mob demands that he be turned over to them for lynching for god s sake officers cries the distracted wretch have ye hearts of stone that ye will not let them wrest me from ye sorry jimmy says one of the policemen but it won t do there s three of us me and darrel and the plain clothes man and there s only sivin thousand of the mob how d we explain it at the office if they took ye jist chase the infuriated aggregation around the corner darrel and we ll be movin along to the station some of our gatherings of excited citizens have not been so harmless said the new yorker with a faint note of civic pride i ll admit that said the tall man a cousin of mine who was on a visit here once had an arm broken and lost an ear in one of them that must have been during the cooper union riots remarked the new yorker not the cooper union explained the tall man but it was a union riot at the vanastor wedding you seem to be in favor of lynch law said the new yorker severely no sir i am not no intelligent man is but sir there are certain cases when people rise in their just majesty and take a righteous vengeance for crimes that the law is slow in punishing i am an advocate of law and order but i will say to you that less than six months ago i myself assisted at the lynching of one of that race that is creating a wide chasm between your section of country and mine sir it is a deplorable condition said the new yorker that exists in the south but i am from indiana sir said the tall man taking another chew and i don t think you will condemn my course when i tell you that the colored man in question had stolen in cash sir from my own brother the snow man editorial note before the fatal illness of william sydney porter known through his literary work as o henry this american master of short story writing had begun for hampton s magazine the story printed below illness crept upon him rapidly and he was compelled to give up writing about at the point where the girl enters the story when he realized that he could do no more it was his lifelong habit to write with a pencil never dictating to a stenographer o henry told in detail the remainder of the snow man to harris merton lyon whom he had often spoken of as one of the most effective short story writers of the present time mr porter had delineated all of the characters leaving only the rounding out of the plot in the final pages to mr lyon housed and windowpaned from it the greatest wonder to little children is the snow to men it is something like a crucible in which their world melts into a white star ten million miles away the man who can stand the test is a snow man and this is his reading by fahrenheit reaumur or moses s carven tablets of stone night had fluttered a sable pinion above the canyon of big lost river and i urged my horse toward the bay horse ranch because the snow was deepening the flakes were as large as an hour s circular tatting by miss wilkins s ablest spinster betokening a heavy snowfall and less entertainment and more adventure than the completion of the tatting could promise i knew ross curtis of the bay horse and that i would be welcome as a snow bound pilgrim both for hospitality s sake and because ross had few chances to confide in living creatures who did not neigh bellow bleat yelp or howl during his discourse the ranch house was just within the jaws of the canyon where its builder may have fatuously fancied that the timbered and rocky walls on both sides would have protected it from the wintry colorado winds but i feared the drift even now through the endless bottomless rift in the hills the speaking tube of the four winds came roaring the voice of the proprietor to the little room on the top floor at my hello a ranch hand came from an outer building and received my thankful horse in another minute ross and i sat by a stove in the dining room of the four room ranch house while the big simple welcome of the household lay at my disposal fanned by the whizzing norther the fine dry snow was sifted and bolted through the cracks and knotholes of the logs the cook room without a separating door appended in there i could see a short sturdy leisurely and weather beaten man moving with professional sureness about his red hot stove his face was stolid and unreadable something like that of a great thinker or of one who had no thoughts to conceal i thought his eye seemed unwarrantably superior to the elements and to the man but quickly attributed that to the characteristic self importance of a petty chef camp cook was the niche that i gave him in the hall of types and he fitted it as an apple fits a dumpling cold it was in spite of the glowing stove and ross and i sat and talked shuddering frequently half from nerves and half from the freezing draughts so he brought the bottle and the cook brought boiling water and we made prodigious hot toddies against the attacks of boreas we clinked glasses often they sounded like icicles dropping from the eaves or like the tinkle of a thousand prisms on a louis xiv chandelier that i once heard at a boarder s dance in the parlor of a ten a week boarding house in gramercy square sic transit silence in the terrible beauty of the snow and of the sphinx and of the stars but they who believe that all things from a without wine table d hote to the crucifixion may be interpreted through music might have found a nocturne or a symphony to express the isolation of that blotted out world the clink of glass and bottle the aeolian chorus of the wind in the house crannies its deeper trombone through the canyon below and the wagnerian crash of the cook s pots and pans united in a fit discordant melody i thought no less welcome an accompaniment was the sizzling of broiling ham and venison cutlet indorsed by the solvent fumes of true java bringing rich promises of comfort to our yearning souls the cook brought the smoking supper to the table he nodded to me democratically as he cast the heavy plates around as though he were pitching quoits or hurling the discus i looked at him with some appraisement and curiosity and much conciliation there was no prophet to tell us when that drifting evil outside might cease to fall and it is well when snow bound to stand somewhere within the radius of the cook s favorable consideration but i could read neither favor nor disapproval in the face and manner of our pot wrestler he was about five feet nine inches and two hundred pounds of commonplace bull necked pink faced callous calm he wore brown duck trousers too tight and too short and a blue flannel shirt with sleeves rolled above his elbows there was a sort of grim steady scowl on his features that looked to me as though he had fixed it there purposely as a protection against the weakness of an inherent amiability that he fancied were better concealed and then i let supper usurp his brief occupancy of my thoughts draw up george said ross let s all eat while the grub s hot you fellows go on and chew answered the cook i ate mine in the kitchen before sun down think it ll be a big snow george asked the ranchman george had turned to reenter the cook room he moved slowly around and looking at his face it seemed to me that he was turning over the wisdom and knowledge of centuries in his head it might was his delayed reply at the door of the kitchen he stopped and looked back at us both ross and i held our knives and forks poised and gave him our regard some men have the power of drawing the attention of others without speaking a word their attitude is more effective than a shout and again it mightn t said george and went back to his stove after we had eaten he came in and gathered the emptied dishes he stood for a moment while his spurious frown deepened it might stop any minute he said or it might keep up for days at the farther end of the cook room i saw george pour hot water into his dishpan light his pipe and put the tableware through its required lavation he then carefully unwrapped from a piece of old saddle blanket a paperback book and settled himself to read by his dim oil lamp and then the ranchman threw tobacco on the cleared table and set forth again the bottles and glasses and i saw that i stood in a deep channel through which the long dammed flood of his discourse would soon be booming but i was half content comparing my fate with that of the late thomas tucker who had to sing for his supper thus doubling the burdens of both himself and his host snow is a hell of a thing said ross by way of a foreword it ain t somehow it seems to me salubrious i can stand water and mud and two inches below zero and a hundred and ten in the shade and medium sized cyclones but this here fuzzy white stuff naturally gets me all locoed i reckon the reason it rattles you is because it changes the look of things so much it s like you had a wife and left her in the morning with the same old blue cotton wrapper on and rides in of a night and runs across her all outfitted in a white silk evening frock waving an ostrich feather fan and monkeying with a posy of lily flowers wouldn t it make you look for your pocket compass you d be liable to kiss her before you collected your presence of mind by and by the flood of ross s talk was drawn up into the clouds so it pleased me to fancy and there condensed into the finer snowflakes of thought and we sat silent about the stove as good friends and bitter enemies will do i thought of boss s preamble about the mysterious influence upon man exerted by that ermine lined monster that now covered our little world and knew he was right of all the curious knickknacks mysteries puzzles indian gifts rat traps and well disguised blessings that the gods chuck down to us from the olympian peaks the most disquieting and evil bringing is the snow by scientific analysis it is absolute beauty and purity so at the beginning we look doubtfully at chemistry it falls upon the world and lo we live in another it hides in a night the old scars and familiar places with which we have grown heart sick or enamored so as quietly as we can we hustle on our embroidered robes and hie us on prince camaralzaman s horse or in the reindeer sleigh into the white country where the seven colors converge this is when our fancy can overcome the bane of it but in certain spots of the earth comes the snow madness made known by people turned wild and distracted by the bewildering veil that has obscured the only world they know in the cities the white fairy who sets the brains of her dupes whirling by a wave of her wand is cast for the comedy role her diamond shoe buckles glitter like frost with a pirouette she invites the spotless carnival but in the waste places the snow is sardonic sponging out the world of the outliers it gives no foothold on another sphere in return it makes of the earth a firmament under foot it leaves us clawing and stumbling in space in an inimical fifth element whose evil outdoes its strangeness and beauty there nature low comedienne plays her tricks on man though she has put him forth as her highest product it appears that she has fashioned him with what seems almost incredible carelessness and indexterity one sided and without balance with his two halves unequally fashioned and joined must he ever jog his eccentric way the snow falls the darkness caps it and the ridiculous man biped strays in accurate circles until he succumbs in the ruins of his defective architecture in the throat of the thirsty the snow is vitriol in appearance as plausible as the breakfast food of the angels it is as hot in the mouth as ginger increasing the pangs of the water famished it is a derivative from water air and some cold uncanny fire from which the caloric has been extracted good has been said of it even the poets crazed by its spell and shivering in their attics under its touch have indited permanent melodies commemorative of its beauty still to the saddest overcoated optimist it is a plague a corroding plague that pharaoh successfully side stepped it beneficently covers the wheat fields swelling the crop and the flour trust gets us by the throat like a sudden quinsy it spreads the tail of its white kirtle over the red seams of the rugged north and the alaskan short story is born etiolated perfidy it shelters the mountain traveler burrowing from the icy air and melting to morrow drowns his brother in the valley below at its worst it is lock and key and crucible and the wand of circe when it corrals man in lonely ranches mountain cabins and forest huts the snow makes apes and tigers of the hardiest it turns the bosoms of weaker ones to glass their tongues to infants rattles their hearts to lawlessness and spleen it is not all from the isolation the snow is not merely a blockader it is a chemical test it is a good man who can show a reaction that is not chiefly composed of a drachm or two of potash and magnesia with traces of adam ananias nebuchadnezzar and the fretful porcupine this is no story you say well let it begin there was a knock at the door is the opening not full of context and reminiscence oh best buyers of best sellers we drew the latch and in stumbled etienne girod as he afterward named himself but just then he was no more than a worm struggling for life enveloped in a killing white chrysalis we dug down through snow overcoats mufflers and waterproofs and dragged forth a living thing with a van dyck beard and marvellous diamond rings we put it through the approved curriculum of snow rubbing hot milk and teaspoonful doses of whiskey working him up to a graduating class entitled to a diploma of three fingers of rye in half a glassful of hot water one of the ranch boys had already come from the quarters at ross s bugle like yell and kicked the stranger s staggering pony to some sheltered corral where beasts were entertained let a paragraphic biography of girod intervene etienne was an opera singer originally we gathered but adversity and the snow had made him non compos vocis the adversity consisted of the stranded san salvador opera company a period of hotel second story work and then a career as a professional palmist jumping from town to town for like other professional palmists every time he worked the heart line too strongly he immediately moved along the line of least resistance though etienne did not confide this to us we surmised that he had moved out into the dusk about twenty minutes ahead of a constable and had thus encountered the snow in his most sacred blue language he dilated upon the subject of snow for etienne was paris born and loved the snow with the same passion that an orchid does mee ser rhable commented etienne and took another three fingers complete cast iron pussy footed blank blank said ross and followed suit rotten said i the cook said nothing he stood in the door weighing our outburst and insistently from behind that frozen visage i got two messages via the m a m wireless one was that george considered our vituperation against the snow childish the other was that george did not love dagoes inasmuch as etienne was a frenchman i concluded i had the message wrong so i queried the other bright eyes you don t really mean dagoes do you and over the wireless came three deathly psychic taps yes then i reflected that to george all foreigners were probably dagoes i had once known another camp cook who had thought mons sig and millie trans mississippi for mlle were italian given names this cook used to marvel therefore at the paucity of neo roman precognomens and therefore why not i have said that snow is a test of men for one day two days etienne stood at the window fletcherizing his finger nails and shrieking and moaning at the monotony to me etienne was just about as unbearable as the snow and so seeking relief i went out on the second day to look at my horse slipped on a stone broke my collarbone and thereafter underwent not the snow test but the test of flat on the back a test that comes once too often for any man to stand however i bore up cheerfully i was now merely a spectator and from my couch in the big room i could lie and watch the human interplay with that detached impassive impersonal feeling which french writers tell us is so valuable to the litterateur and american writers to the faro dealer i shall go crazy in this abominable mee ser rhable place was etienne s constant prediction never knew mark twain to bore me before said ross over and over he sat by the other window hour after hour a box of pittsburg stogies of the length strength and odor of a pittsburg graft scandal deposited on one side of him and roughing it the jumping frog and life on the mississippi on the other for every chapter he lit a new stogy puffing furiously this in time gave him a recurrent premonition of cramps gastritis smoker s colic or whatever it is they have in pittsburg after a too deep indulgence in graft scandals to fend off the colic ross resorted time and again to old doctor still s amber colored u s a colic cure result after forty eight hours nerves positive fact i never knew mark twain to make me tired before positive fact ross slammed roughing it on the floor when you re snowbound this away you want tragedy i guess humor just seems to bring out all your cussedness you read a man s poor pitiful attempts to be funny and it makes you so nervous you want to tear the book up get out your bandana and have a good long cry at the other end of the room the frenchman took his finger nails out of his mouth long enough to exclaim humor humor at such a time as thees my god i shall go crazy in thees abominable supper announced george these meals were not the meals of rabelais who said the great god makes the planets and we make the platters neat by that time the ranch house meals were not affairs of gusto they were mental distraction not bodily provender what they were to be later shall never be forgotten by ross or me or etienne after supper the stogies and finger nails began again my shoulder ached wretchedly and with half closed eyes i tried to forget it by watching the deft movements of the stolid cook suddenly i saw him cock his ear like a dog then with a swift step he moved to the door threw it open and stood there the rest of us had heard nothing what is it george asked ross the cook reached out his hand into the darkness alongside the jamb with careful precision he prodded something then he made one careful step into the snow his back muscles bulged a little under the arms as he stooped and lightly lifted a burden another step inside the door which he shut methodically behind him and he dumped the burden at a safe distance from the fire he stood up and fixed us with a solemn eye none of us moved under that orphic suspense until a woman remarked george miss willie adams was her name vocation school teacher present avocation getting lost in the snow age yum yum the persian for twenty take to the woods if you would describe miss adams a willow for grace a hickory for fibre a birch for the clear whiteness of her skin for eyes the blue sky seen through treetops the silk in cocoons for her hair her voice the murmur of the evening june wind in the leaves her mouth the berries of the wintergreen fingers as light as ferns her toe as small as a deer track general impression upon the dazed beholder you could not see the forest for the trees psychology with a capital p and the foot of a lynx at this juncture stalks into the ranch house three men a cook a pretty young woman all snowbound count me out of it as i did not count anyway i never did with women count the cook out if you like but note the effect upon ross and etienne girod ross dumped mark twain in a trunk and locked the trunk also he discarded the pittsburg scandals also he shaved off a three days beard etienne being french began on the beard first he pomaded it from a little tube of grease hongroise in his vest pocket he combed it with a little aluminum comb from the same vest pocket he trimmed it with manicure scissors from the same vest pocket his light and gallic spirits underwent a sudden miraculous change he hummed a blithe san salvador opera company tune he grinned smirked bowed pirouetted twiddled twaddled twisted and tooralooed gayly the notorious troubadour could not have equalled etienne ross s method of advance was brusque domineering little woman he said you re welcome here and with what he thought subtle double meaning welcome to stay here as long as you like snow or no snow miss adams thanked him a little wildly some of the wintergreen berries creeping into the birch bark she looked around hurriedly as if seeking escape but there was none save the kitchen and the room allotted her she made an excuse and disappeared into her own room later i feigning sleep heard the following mees adams i was almost to perislh die of monotony w en your fair and beautiful face appear in thees mee ser rhable house i opened my starboard eye the beard was being curled furiously around a finger the svengali eye was rolling the chair was being hunched closer to the school teacher s i am french you see temperamental nervous i cannot endure thees dull hours in thees ranch house but a woman comes ah the shoulders gave nine rahs and a tiger what a difference all is light and gay ever ting smile w en you smile you have eart beauty grace my eart comes back to me w en i feel your eart so he laid his hand upon his vest pocket from this vantage point he suddenly snatched at the school teacher s own hand ah mees adams if i could only tell you how i ad dinner remarked george he was standing just behind the frenchman s ear his eyes looked straight into the school teacher s eyes after thirty seconds of survey his lips moved deep in the flinty frozen maelstrom of his face dinner he concluded will be ready in two minutes miss adams jumped to her feet relieved i must get ready for dinner she said brightly and went into her room ross came in fifteen minutes late after the dishes had been cleaned away i waited until a propitious time when the room was temporarily ours alone and told him what had happened he became so excited that he lit a stogy without thinking yeller hided unwashed palm readin skunk he said under his breath i ll shoot him full o holes if he don t watch out talkin that way to my wife i gave a jump that set my collarbone back another week your wife i gasped well i mean to make her that he announced the air in the ranch house the rest of that day was tense with pent up emotions oh best buyers of best sellers ross watched miss adams as a hawk does a hen he watched etienne as a hawk does a scarecrow etienne watched miss adams as a weasel does a henhouse he paid no attention to ross the condition of miss adams in the role of sought after was feverish lately escaped from the agony and long torture of the white cold where for hours nature had kept the little school teacher s vision locked in and turned upon herself nobody knows through what profound feminine introspections she had gone now suddenly cast among men instead of finding relief and security she beheld herself plunged anew into other discomforts even in her own room she could hear the loud voices of her imposed suitors i ll blow you full o holes shouted ross witnesses shrieked etienne waving his hand at the cook and me she could not have known the previous harassed condition of the men fretting under indoor conditions all she knew was that where she had expected the frank freemasonry of the west she found the subtle tangle of two men s minds bent upon exacting whatever romance there might be in her situation she tried to dodge ross and the frenchman by spells of nursing me they also came over to help nurse this combination aroused such a natural state of invalid cussedness on my part that they were all forced to retire once she did manage to whisper i am so worried here i don t know what to do to which i replied gently hitching up my shoulder that i was a hunch savant and that the eighth house under this sign the moon being in virgo showed that everything would turn out all right but twenty minutes later i saw etienne reading her palm and felt that perhaps i might have to recast her horoscope and try for a dark man coming with a bundle toward sunset etienne left the house for a few moments and ross who had been sitting taciturn and morose having unlocked mark twain made another dash it was typical ross talk he stood in front of her and looked down majestically at that cool and perfect spot where miss adams forehead met the neat part in her fragrant hair first however he cast a desperate glance at me i was in a profound slumber little woman he began it s certainly tough for a man like me to see you bothered this way you gulp you have been alone in this world too long you need a protector i might say that at a time like this you need a protector the worst kind a protector who would take a three ring delight in smashing the saffron colored kisser off of any yeller skinned skunk that made himself obnoxious to you hem hem i am a lonely man miss adams i have so far had to carry on my life without the gulp sweet radiance gulp of a woman around the house i feel especially doggoned lonely at a time like this when i am pretty near locoed from havin to stall indoors and hence it was with delight i welcomed your first appearance in this here shack since then i have been packed jam full of more different kinds of feelings ornery mean dizzy and superb than has fallen my way in years miss adams made a useless movement toward escape the ross chin stuck firm i don t want to annoy you miss adams but by heck if it comes to that you ll have to be annoyed and i ll have to have my say this palm ticklin slob of a frenchman ought to be kicked off the place and if you ll say the word off he goes but i don t want to do the wrong thing you ve got to show a preference i m gettin around to the point miss miss willie in my own brick fashion i ve stood about all i can stand these last two days and somethin s got to happen the suspense hereabouts is enough to hang a sheepherder miss willie he lassooed her hand by main force just say the word you need somebody to take your part all your life long will you mar supper remarked george tersely from the kitchen door miss adams hurried away ross turned angrily you i have been revolving it in my head said george he brought the coffee pot forward heavily then bravely the big platter of pork and beans then somberly the potatoes then profoundly the biscuits i have been revolving it in my mind there ain t no use waitin any longer for swengalley might as well eat now from my excellent vantage point on the couch i watched the progress of that meal ross muddled glowering disappointed etienne eternally blandishing attentive ogling miss adams nervous picking at her food hesitant about answering questions almost hysterical now and then the solid flitting shadow of the cook passing behind their backs like a dreadnaught in a fog i used to own a clock which gurgled in its throat three minutes before it struck the hour i know therefore the slow freight of anticipation for i have awakened at three in the morning heard the clock gurgle and waited those three minutes for the three strokes i knew were to come alors in ross s ranch house that night the slow freight of climax whistled in the distance etienne began it after supper miss aclams had suddenly displayed a lively interest in the kitchen layout and i could see her in there chatting brightly at george not with him the while he ducked his head and rattled his pans my fren said etienne exhaling a large cloud from his cigarette and patting ross lightly on the shoulder with a bediamonded hand which hung limp from a yard or more of bony arm i see i mus be frank with you firs because we are rivals second because you take these matters so serious i i am frenchman i love the women he threw back his curls bared his yellow teeth and blew an unsavory kiss toward the kitchen it is i suppose a trait of my nation all frenchmen love the women pretty women now look here i am he spread out his arms cold outside i detes the col l l snow i abominate the mees ser rhable snow two men this pointing to me an this pointing to ross i am distracted for two whole days i stan at the window an tear my air i am nervous upset pr r ro foun ly distress inside my ead an suddenly be old a woman a nice pretty charming innocen young woman i naturally rejoice i become myself again gay light earted appy i address myself to mademoiselle it passes the time that m sieu is wot the women are for pass the time entertainment like the music like the wine they appeal to the mood the caprice the temperamen to play with thees woman follow her through her humor pursue her ah that is the mos delightful way to sen the hours about their business ross banged the table shut up you miserable yeller pup he roared i object to your pursuin anything or anybody in my house now you listen to me you he picked up the box of stogies and used it on the table as an emphasizer the noise of it awoke the attention of the girl in the kitchen unheeded she crept into the room i don t know anything about your french ways of lovemakin an i don t care in my section of the country it s the best man wins and i m the best man here and don t you forget it this girl s goin to be mine there ain t g oing to be any playing or philandering or palm reading about it i ve made up my mind i ll have this girl and that settles it my word is the law in this neck o the woods she s mine and as soon as she says she s mine you pull out the box made one final tremendous punctuation point etienne s bravado was unruffled ah that is no way to win a woman he smiled easily i make prophecy you will never win er that way no not thees woman she mus be played along an then keessed this charming delicious little creature one kees an then you ave her again he displayed his unpleasant teeth i make you a bet i will kees her as a cheerful chronicler of deeds done well it joys me to relate that the hand which fell upon etienne s amorous lips was not his own there was one sudden sound as of a mule kicking a lath fence and then through the swinging doors of oblivion for etienne i had seen this blow delivered it was an aloof unstudied almost absent minded affair i had thought the cook was rehearsing the proper method of turning a flapjack silently lost in thought he stood there scratching his head then he began rolling down his sleeves you d better get your things on miss and we ll get out of here he decided wrap up warm i heard her heave a little sigh of relief as she went to get her cloak sweater and hat ross jumped to his feet and said george what are you goin to do george who had been headed in my direction slowly swivelled around and faced his employer bein a camp cook i ain t over burdened with hosses george enlightened us therefore i am going to try to borrow this feller s here for the first time in four days my soul gave a genuine cheer if it s for lochinvar purposes go as far as you like i said grandly the cook studied me a moment as if trying to find an insult in my words no he replied it s for mine and the young lady s purposes and we ll go only three miles to hicksville now let me tell you somethin ross suddenly i was confronted with the cook s chunky back and i heard a low curt carrying voice shoot through the room at my host george had wheeled just as ross started to speak you re nutty that s what s the matter with you you can t stand the snow you re getting nervouser and nuttier every day that and this dago he jerked a thumb at the half dead frenchman in the corner has got you to the point where i thought i better horn in i got to revolving it around in my mind and i seen if somethin wasn t done and done soon there d be murder around here and maybe his head gave an imperceptible list toward the girl s room worse he stopped but he held up a stubby finger to keep any one else from speaking then he plowed slowly through the drift of his ideas about this here woman i know you ross and i know what you reely think about women if she hadn t happened in here durin this here snow you d never have given two thoughts to the whole woman question likewise when the storm clears and you and the boys go hustlin out this here whole business ll clear out of your head and you won t think of a skirt again until kingdom come just because o this snow here don t forget you re living in the selfsame world you was in four days ago and you re the same man too now what s the use o getting all snarled up over four days of stickin in the house that there s what i been revolvin in my mind and this here s the decision i ve come to he plodded to the door and shouted to one of the ranch hands to saddle my horse ross lit a stogy and stood thoughtful in the middle of the room then he began i ve a durn good notion george to knock your confounded head off and throw you into that snowbank if you re wrong mister that ain t a durned good notion you ve got it s durned bad look here he pointed steadily out of doors until we were both forced to follow his finger you re in here for more n a week yet after allowing this fact to sink in he barked out at ross can you cook then at me can you cook then he looked at the wreck of etienne and sniffed there was an embarrassing silence as ross and i thought solemnly of a foodless week if you just use hoss sense concluded george and don t go for to hurt my feelin s all i want to do is to take this young gal down to hicksville and then i ll head back here and cook fer you the horse and miss adams arrived simultaneously both of them very serious and quiet the horse because he knew what he had before him in that weather the girl because of what she had left behind then all at once i awoke to a realization of what the cook was doing my god man i cried aren t you afraid to go out in that snow behind my back i heard ross mutter not him george lifted the girl daintily up behind the saddle drew on his gloves put his foot in the stirrup and turned to inspect me leisurely as i passed slowly in his review i saw in my mind s eye the algebraic equation of snow the equals sign and the answer in the man before me snow is my last name said george he swung into the saddle and they started cautiously out into the darkening swirl of fresh new currency just issuing from the snowdrop mint the girl to keep her place clung happily to the sturdy figure of the camp cook i brought three things away from ross curtis s ranch house yes four one was the appreciation of snow which i have so humbly tried here to render was a collarbone of which i am extra careful was a memory of what it is to eat very extremely bad food for a week and was the cause of a little note delivered at the end of the week and hand painted in blue pencil on a sheet of meat paper i cannot come back there to that there job mrs snow say no george i been revolvin it in my mind considerin circumstances she s right whirligigs the world and the door a favourite dodge to get your story read by the public is to assert that it is true and then add that truth is stranger than fiction i do not know if the yarn i am anxious for you to read is true but the spanish purser of the fruit steamer el carrero swore to me by the shrine of santa guadalupe that he had the facts from the u s vice consul at la paz a person who could not possibly have been cognizant of half of them as for the adage quoted above i take pleasure in punc turing it by affirming that i read in a purely fictional story the other day the line be it so said the police man nothing so strange has yet cropped out in truth when h ferguson hedges millionaire promoter investor and man about new york turned his thoughts upon matters convivial and word of it went down the line bouncers took a precautionary turn at the indian clubs waiters put ironstone china on his favourite tables cab drivers crowded close to the curbstone in front of all night caf s and careful cashiers in his regular haunts charged up a few bottles to his account by way of preface and introduction as a money power a one millionaire is of small account in a city where the man who cuts your slice of beef behind the free lunch counter rides to work in his own automobile but hedges spent his money as lavishly loudly and showily as though he were only a clerk squandering a week s wages and after all the bartender takes no interest in your reserve fund he would rather look you up on his cash register than in bradstreet on the evening that the material allegation of facts begins hedges was bidding dull care begone in the com pany of five or six good fellows acquaintances and friends who had gathered in his wake among them were two younger men ralph merriam a broker and wade his friend two deep sea cabmen were chartered at columbus circle they hove to long enough to revile the statue of the great navigator unpatriotically rebuking him for having voyaged in search of land instead of liquids midnight overtook the party marooned in the rear of a cheap caf far uptown hedges was arrogant overriding and quarrelsome he was burly and tough iron gray but vigorous good for the rest of the night there was a dispute about nothing that matters and the five fingered words were passed the words that represent the glove cast into the lists merriam played the r le of the verbal hotspur hedges rose quickly seized his chair swung it once and smashed wildly dowp at merriam s head merriam dodged drew a small revolver and shot hedges in the chest the leading roysterer stumbled fell in a wry heap and lay still wade a commuter had formed that habit of prompt ness he juggled merriam out a side door walked him to the corner ran him a block and caught a hansom they rode five minutes and then got out on a dark corner and dismissed the cab across the street the lights of a small saloon betrayed its hectic hospitality go in the back room of that saloon said wade and wait i ll go find out what s doing and let you know you may take two drinks while i am gone no more at ten minutes to one o clock wade returned brace up old chap he said the ambulance got there just as i did the doctor says he s dead you may have one more drink you let me run this thing for you you ve got to skip i don t believe a chair is legally a deadly weapon you ve got to make tracks that s all there is to it merriam complained of the cold querulously and asked for another drink did you notice what big veins he had on the back of his hands he said i never could stand i never could take one more said wade and then come on i ll see you through wade kept his promise so well that at eleven o clock the next morning merriam with a new suit case full of new clothes and hair brushes stepped quietly on board a little ton fruit steamer at an east river pier the vessel had brought the season s first cargo of limes from port limon and was homeward bound merriam had his bank balance of in his pocket in large bills and brief instructions to pile up as much water as he could between himself and new york there was no time for anything more from port limon merriam worked down the coast by schooner and sloop to colon thence across the isthmus to panama where he caught a tramp bound for callao and such intermediate ports as might tempt the discursive skipper from his course it was at la paz that merriam decided to land la paz the beautiful a little harbourless town smothered in a living green ribbon that banded the foot of a cloud piercing mountain here the little steamer stopped to tread water while the captain s dory took him ashore that he might feel the pulse of the cocoanut market merriam went too with his suit case and remained kalb the vice consul a gr co armenian citizen of the united states born in hessen darmstadt and edu cated in cincinnati ward primaries considered all ameri cans his brothers and bankers he attached himself to merriam s elbow introduced him to every one in la paz who wore shoes borrowed ten dollars and went back to his hammock there was a little wooden hotel in the edge of a banana grove facing the sea that catered to the tastes of the few foreigners that had dropped out of the world into the t ri qte peruvian town at kalb s introductory shake hands with he had obediently exchanged manual salutations with a german doctor one french and two italian merchants and three or four americans who were spoken of as gold men rubber men mahogany men anything but men of living tissue after dinner merriam sat in a corner of the broad front galeria with bibb a vermonter interested in hydraulic mining and smoked and drank scotch smoke the moonlit sea spreading infinitely before him seemed to separate him beyond all apprehension from his old life the horrid tragedy in which he had played such a disas trous part now began for the first time since he stole on board the fruiter a wretched fugitive to lose its sharper outlines distance lent assuagement to his view bibb had opened the flood gates of a stream of long dammed discourse overjoyed to have captured an audience that had not suffered under a hundred repetitions of his views and theories one year more said bibb and i ll go back to god s country oh i know it s pretty here and you get dolce far niente banded to you in chunks but this country wasn t made for a white man to live in you ve got to have to plug through snow now and then and see a game of baseball and wear a stiff collar and have a policeman cuss you still la paz is a good sort of a pipe dreamy old hole and mrs conant is here when any of us feels particularly like jumping into the sea we rush around to her house and propose it s nicer to be rejected by mrs conant than it is to be drowned and they say drowning is a delightful sensation many like her here asked merriam not anywhere said bibb with a comfortable sigh she s the only white woman in la paz the rest range from a dappled dun to the colour of a b flat piano key she s been here a year comes from well you know how a woman can talk ask em to say string and they ll say crow s foot or cat s cradle some times you d think she was from oshkosh and again from jacksonville florida and the next day from cape cod mystery ventured merriam m well she looks it but her talk s translucent enough but that s a woman i suppose if the sphinx were to begin talking she d merely say goodness me more visitors coming for dinner and nothing to eat but the sand which is here but you won t think about that when you meet her merriam you ll propose to her too to make a hard story soft merriam did meet her and propose to her he found her to be a woman in black with hair the colour of a bronze turkey s wings and mysterious remembering eyes that well that looked as if she might have been a trained nurse looking on when eve was created her words and manner though were translucent as bibb had said she spoke vaguely of friends in california and some of the lower parishes in louisiana the tropical climate and indolent life suited her she had thought of buying an orange grove later on la paz all in all charmed her merriam s courtship of the sphinx lasted three months although be did not know that he was courting her he was using her as an antidote for remorse until he found too late that he had acquired the habit during that time he had received no news from home wade did not know where he was and he was not sure of wade s exact address and was afraid to write he thought he had better let matters rest as they were for a while one afternoon he and mrs conant hired two ponies and rode out along the mountain trail as far as the little cold river that came tumbling down the foothills there they stopped for a drink and merriam spoke his piece he proposed as bibb had prophesied mrs conant gave him one glance of brilliant tenderness and then her face took on such a strange haggard look that merriam was shaken out of his intoxication and back to his senses i beg your pardon florence he said releasing her hand but i ll have to hedge on part of what i said i can t ask you to marry me of course i killed a man in new york a man who was my friend shot him down in quite a cowardly manner i understand of course the drinking didn t excuse it well i couldn t resist having my say and i ll always mean it i m here as a fugitive from justice and i suppose that ends our acquaintance mrs conant plucked little leaves assiduously from the low hanging branch of a lime tree i suppose so she said in low and oddly uneven tones but that depends upon you i ll be as honest as you were i poisoned my husband i am a self made widow a man cannot love a murderess so i suppose that ends our acquaintance she looked up at him slowly his face turned a little pale and he stared at her blankly like a deaf and dumb man who was wondering what it was all about she took a swift step toward him with stiffened arms and eyes blazing don t look at me like that she cried as though she were in acute pain curse me or turn your back on me but don t look that way am i a woman to be beaten if i could show you here on my arms and on my back are scars and it has been more than a year scars that he made in his brutal rages a holy nun would have risen and struck the fiend down yes i killed him the foul and horrible words that he hurled at me that last day are repeated in my ears every night when i sleep and then came his blows and the end of my endurance i got the poison that afternoon it was his custom to drink every night in the library before going to bed a hot punch made of rum and wine only from my fair hands would he receive it because he knew the fumes of spirits always sickened me that night when the maid brought it to me i sent her downstairs on an errand before taking him his drink i went to my little private cabinet and poured into it more than a tea spoonful of tincture of aconite enough to kill three men so i had learned i had drawn that i had in bank and with that and a few things in a satchel i left the house without any one seeing me as i passed the library i heard him stagger up and fall heavily on a couch i took a night train for new orleans and from there i sailed to the bermudas i finally cast anchor in la paz and now what have you to say can you open your mouth merriam came back to life florence he said earnestly i want you i don t care what you ve done if the world ralph she interrupted almost with a scream be my world her eyes melted she relaxed magnificentlv and swayed toward merriam so suddenly that he had to jump to catch her dear me in such scenes how the talk runs into artificial prose but it can t be helped it s the subconscious smell of the footlights smoke that s in all of us stir the depths of your cook s soul sufficiently and she will discourse in bulwer lyttonese merriam and mrs conant were very happy he announced their engagement at the hotel orilla del mar eight foreigners and four native astors pounded his back and shouted insincere congratulations at him pedrito the castilian mannered barkeep was goaded to extra duty until his agility would have turned a boston cherry phosphate clerk a pale lilac with envy they were both very happy according to the strange mathematics of the god of mutual affinity the shadows that clouded their pasts when united became only half as dense instead of darker they shut the world out and bolted the doors each was the other s world mrs conant lived again the remembering look left her eyes merriam was with her every moment that was possible on a little plateau under a grove of palms and calabash trees they were going to build a fairy bungalow they were to be married in two months many hours of the day they had their heads together over the house plans their joint capital would set up a business in fruit or woods that would yield a comfortable support good night my world would say mrs conant every evening when merriam left her for his hotel they were very happy their love had circumstantially that element of melancholy in it that it seems to require to attain its supremest elevation and it seemed that their mutual great misfortune or sin was a bond that nothing could sever one day a steamer hove in the offing bare legged and bare shouldered la paz scampered down to the beach for the arrival of a steamer was their loop the loop circus emancipation day and four o clock tea when the steamer was near enough wise ones pro claimed that she was the pajaro bound up coast from callao to panama the paiaro put on brakes a mile off shore soon a boat came bobbing shoreward merriam strolled down on the beach to look on in the shallow water the carib sailors sprang out and dragged the boat with a mighty rush to the firm shingle out climbed the purser the captain and two passengers ploughing their way through the deep sand toward the hotel merriam glanced toward them with the mild interest due to strangers there was something familiar to him in the walk of one of the pas sengers he looked again and his blood seemed to turn to strawberry ice cream in his veins burly arrogant debonair as ever h ferguson hedges the man he had killed was coming toward him ten feet away when hedges saw merriam his face flushed a dark red then he shouted in his old bluff way hello merriam glad to see you didn t expect to find you out here quinby this is my old friend merriam of new york merriam mr quinby merriam gave hedges and then quinby an ice cold hand br r r r said hedges but you ve got a frapp d flipper man you re not well you re as yellow as a chinaman malarial here steer us to a bar if there is such a thing and let s take a prophylactic merriam still half comatose led them toward the hotel orilla del mar quinby and i explained hedges puffing through the slippery sand are looking out along the coast for some investments we ve just come up from concepci n and valparaiso and lima the captain of this sub sidized ferry boat told us there was some good picking around here in silver mines so we got off now where is that caf merriam oh in this portable soda water pavilion leaving quinby at the bar hedges drew merriam side now what does this mean he said with gruff kindness are you sulking about that fool row we had i thought stammered merriam i heard they told me you were that i had well you didn t and i m not said hedges that fool young ambulance surgeon told wade i was a can didate for a coffin just because i d got tired and quit breathing i laid up in a private hospital for a month but here i am kicking as hard as ever wade and i tried to find you but couldn t now merriam shake hands and forget it all i was as much to blame as you were and the shot really did me good i came out of the hospital as healthy and fit as a cab horse come on that drink s waiting old man said merriam brokenly i don t know how to thank you i well you know oh forget it boomed hedges quinby ll die of thirst if we don t join him bibb was sitting on the shady side of the gallery waiting for the eleven o clock breakfast presently merriam came out and joined him his eye was strangely bright bibb my boy said he slowly waving his hand do you see those mountains and that sea and sky and sun shine they re mine bibbsy all mine you go in said bibb and take eight grains of quinine right away it won t do in this climate for a man to get to thinking he s rockefeller or james o neill either inside the purser was untying a great roll of newspapers many of them weeks old gathered in the lower ports by the pajaro to be distributed at casual stopping places thus do the beneficent voyagers scatter news and enter tainment among the prisoners of sea and mountains tio pancho the hotel proprietor set his great silver rimmed aiteojos upon his nose and divided the papers into a number of smaller rolls a barefooted muchacho dashed in desiring the post of messenger bien venido said tio pancho this to se ora conant that to el doctor s s schlegel dios what a name to say that to se or davis one for don alberto these two for the casa de huespedes numero en la calle de las buenas gracias and say to them all muchacho that the pajaro sails for panama at three this afternoon if any have letters to send by the post let them come quickly that they may first pass through the correo mrs conant received her roll of newspapers at four o clock the boy was late in delivering them because he had been deflected from his duty by an iguana that crossed his path and to which he immediately gave chase but it made no hardship for she had no letters to send she was idling in a hammock in the patio of the house that she occupied half awake half happily dreaming of the paradise that she and merriam had created out of the wrecks of their pasts she was content now for the horizon of that shimmering sea to be the horizon of her life they had shut out the world and closed the door merriam was coming to her house at seven after his dinner at the hotel she would put on a white dress and an apricot coloured lace mantilla and they would walk an hour under the cocoanut palms by the lagoon she smiled contentedly and chose a paper at random from the roll the boy had brought at first the words of a certain headline of a sunday newspaper meant nothing to her they conveyed only a visualized sense of familiarity the largest type ran thus lloyd b conant secures divorce and then the subheadings well known saint louis paint manufacturer wins suit pleading one year s absence of wife her mysterious disappearance recalled nothing has been heard of her since twisting herself quickly out of the hammock mrs conant s eye soon traversed the half column of the recall it ended thus it will be remembered that mrs conant disappeared one evening in march of last year it was freely rumoured that her marriage with lloyd b conant resulted in much unhappiness stories were not wanting to the effect that his cruelty toward his wife had more than once taken the form of physical abuse after her departure a full bottle of tincture of aconite a deadly poison was found in a small medicine cabinet in her bedroom this might have been an indication that she meditated suicide it is supposed abandoned such an intention if she possessed it and left her home instead mrs conant slowly dropped the paper and sat on a chair clasping her hands tightly let me think o god let me think she whis pered i took the bottle with me i threw it out of the window of the train i there was another bottle in the cabinet there were two side by side the aconite and the valerian that i took when i could not sleep if they found the aconite bottle full why but he is alive of course i gave him only a harmless dose of valerian i am not a murderess in fact ralph i god don t let this be a dream she went into the part of the house that she rented from the old peruvian man and his wife shut the door and walked up and down her room swiftly and feverishly for half an hour merriam s photograph stood in a frame on a table she picked it up looked at it with a smile of exquisite tenderness and dropped four tears on it and merriam only twenty rods away then she stood still for ten minutes looking into space she looked into space through a slowly opening door on her side of the door was the building material for a castle of romance love an arcady of waving palms a lullaby of waves on the shore of a haven of rest respite peace a lotus land of dreamy ease and security a life of poetry and heart s ease and refuge romanticist will you tell me what mrs conant saw on the other side of the door you cannot that is you will not very well then listen she saw herself go into a department store and buy five spools of silk thread and three yards of gingham to make an apron for the cook shall i charge it ma am asked the clerk as she walked out a lady whom she met greeted her cordially oh where did you get the pattern for those sleeves dear mrs conant she said at the corner a policeman helped her across the street and touched his helmet any callers she asked the maid when she reached home mrs waldron answered the maid and the tqvo misses jenkinson very well she said you may bring me a cup of tea maggie mrs conant went to the door and called angela the old peruvian woman if mateo is there send him to me mateo a half breed shuffling and old but efficient came is there a steamer or a vessel of any kind leaving this coast to night or to morrow that i can get passage on she asked mateo considered at punta reina thirty miles down the coast se ora he answered there is a small steamer loading with cinchona and dyewoods she sails for san francisco to morrow at sunrise so says my brother who arrived in his sloop to day passing by punta reina you must take me in that sloop to that steamer to night will you do that perhaps mateo shrugged a suggestive shoul der mrs conant took a handful of money from a drawer and gave it to him get the sloop ready behind the little point of land below the town she ordered get sailors and be ready to sail at six o clock in half an hour bring a cart partly filled with straw into the patio here and take my trunk to the sloop there is more money yet now hurry for one time mateo walked away without shuffling his feet angela cried mrs conant almost fiercely come and help me pack i am going away out with this trunk my clothes first stir yourself those dark dresses first hurry from the first she did not waver from her decision her view was clear and final her door had opened and let the world in her love for merriam was not lessened but it now appeared a hopeless and unrealizable thing the visions of their future that had seemed so blissful and complete had vanished she tried to assure herself that her renunciation was rather for his sake than for her own now that she was cleared of her burden at least technically would not his own weigh too heavily upon him if she should cling to him would not the difference forever silently mar and corrode their happiness thus she reasoned but there were a thousand little voices calling to her that she could feel rather than hear like the hum of distant powerful machinery the little voices of the world that when raised in unison can send their insistent call through the thickest door once while packing a brief shadow of the lotus dream came back to her she held merriam s picture to her heart with one hand while she threw a pair of shoes into the trunk with her other at six o clock mateo returned and reported the sloop ready he and his brother lifted the trunk into the cart covered it with straw and conveyed it to the point of embarkation from there they transferred it on board in the sloop s dory then mateo returned for additional orders mrs conant was ready she had settled all business matters with angela and was impatiently waiting she wore a long loose black silk duster that she often walked about in when the evenino s were chilly on her head was a small round hat and over it the apricot coloured lace mantilla dusk had quickly followed the short twilight mateo led her by dark and grass grown streets toward the point behind which the sloop was anchored on turning a corner they beheld the hotel orilla del mar three streets away nebulously aglow with its array of kerosene lamps mrs conant paused with streamin eyes i must i must see him once before i go she murmured in anguish but even then she did not falter in her decision quickly she invented a plan by which she might speak to him and yet make her departure without his knowing she would walk past the hotel ask some one to call him out and talk a few moments on some trivial excuse leaving him expecting to see her at her home at seven she unpinned her hat and gave it to mateo keep this and wait here till i come she ordered then she draped the mantilla over her head as she usually did when walking after sunset and went straight to the orilla del mar she was glad to see the bulky white clad figure of tio pancho standing alone on the gallery tio pancho she said with a charming smile may i trouble you to ask mr merriam to come out for just a few moments that i may speak with him tio pancho bowed as an elephant bows buenas tardes se ora conant he said as a cavalier talks and then he went on less at his ease but does not the se ora know that se or merriam sailed on the pajaro for panama at three o clock of this afternoon the theory and the hound not many days ago my old friend from the tropics j p bridger united states consul on the island of ratona was in the city we had wassail and jubilee and saw the flatiron building and missed seeing the bronxless menagerie by about a couple of nights and then at the ebb tide we were walking up a street that parallels and parodies broadway a woman with a comely and mundane countenance passed us holding in leash a wheezing vicious waddling brute of a yellow pug the dog entangled himself with bridger s legs and mumbled his ankles in a snarling peevish sulky bite bridger with a happy smile kicked the breath out of the brute the woman showered us with a quick rain of well conceived adjectives that left us in no doubt as to our place in her opinion and we passed on ten yards farther an old woman with dis ordered white hair and her bankbook tucked well hidden beneath her tattered shawl begged bridger stopped and disinterred for her a quarter from his holiday waist coat on the next corner a quarter of a ton of well clothed man with a rice powdered fat white jowl stood holding the chain of a devil born bulldog whose forelegs were strangers by the length of a dachshund a little woman in a last season s hat confronted him and wept which was plainly all she could do while he cursed her in low sweet practised tones bridger smiled again strictly to himself and this time he took out a little memorandum book and made a note of it this he had no right to do without due explanation and i said so it s a new theory said bridger that i picked up down in ratona i ve been gathering support for it as i knock about the world isn t ripe for it yet but well i ll tell you and then you run your mind back along the people you ve known and see what you make of it and so i cornered bridger in a place where they have artificial palms and wine and he told me the story which is here in my words and on his responsibility one afternoon at three o clock on the island of ratona a boy raced alongthe beach screaming pajaro ahoy thus he made known the keenness of his hearing and the justice of his discrimination in pitch he who first heard and made oral proclamation con cerning the toot of an approaching steamer s whistle and correctly named the steamer was a small hero in ratona until the next steamer came wherefore there was rivalry among the barefoot youth of ratona and many fell victims to the softly blown conch shells of sloops which as they enter harbour sound surprisingly like a distant steamer s signal and some could name you the vessel when its call in your duller ears sounded no louder than the sigh of the wind through the branches of the cocoa nut palms but to day he who proclaimed the pajaro gained his honours ratona bent its ear to listen and soon the deep tongued blast grew louder and nearer and at length ratona saw above the line of palms on the low joint the two black funnels of the fruiter slowly creeping toward the mouth of the harbour you must know that ratona is an island twenty miles off the south of a south american republic it is a port of that republic and it sleeps sweetly in a smiling sea toiling not nor spinning fed by the abundant tropics where all things ripen cease and fall toward the grave eight hundred people dream life away in a green embowered village that follows the horseshoe curve of its bijou harbour they are mostly spanish and indian mestizos with a shading of san domingo negroes a lightening of pure blood spanish officials and a slight leavening of the froth of three or four pioneering white races no steamers touch at ratona save the fruit steamers which take on their banana inspectors there on their way to the coast they leave sunday newspapers ice quinine bacon watermelons and vaccine matter at the island and that is about all the touch ratona gets with the world the pajaro paused at the mouth of the harbour roll ing heavily in the swell that sent the whitecaps racing beyond the smooth water inside already two dories from the village one conveying fruit inspectors the other going for what it could get were halfway out to the steamer the inspectors dory was taken on board with them and the pajaro steamed away for the mainland for its load of fruit the other boat returned to ratona bearing a contri bution from the pajaro s store of ice the usual roll of newspapers and one passenger taylor plunkett sheriff of chatham county kentucky bridger the united states consul at ratona was clean ing his rifle in the official shanty under a bread fruit tree twenty yards from the water of the harbour the consul occupied a place somewhat near the tail of his political party s procession the music of the band wagon sounded very faintly to him in the distance the plums of office went to others bridger s share of the spoils the consulship at ratona was little more than a prune a dried prune from the boarding house department of the public crib but yearly was opulence in ratona besides bridger had contracted a passion for shooting alligators in the lagoons near his consulate and was not unhappy he looked up from a careful inspection of his rifle lock a broad man filling his doorway a broad noiseless slow moving man sunburned almost to the vandyke a man of forty five neatly clothed in homespun with scanty light hair a close clipped brown and gray beard and pale blue eyes expressing mildness implicity you are mr bridger the consul said the broad man they directed me here can you tell me what those big bunches of things like gourds are in those trees that look like feather dusters along the edge of the water take that chair said the consul reoiling his clean ing rag no the other one that bamboo thing won t hold you why they re cocoanuts green cocoanuts the shell of em is always a light green before they re ripe much obliged said the other man sitting down carefully i didn t quite like to tell the folks at home they were olives unless i was sure about it my name is plunkett i m sheriff of chatham county kentucky i ve got extradition papers in my pocket authorizing the arrest of a man on this island they ve been signed by the president of this country and they re in correct shape the man s name is wade williams he s in the cocoa nut raising business what he s wanted for is the murder of his wife two years ago where can i find him the consul squinted an eye and looked through his rifle barrel there s nobody on the island who calls himself wil liams he remarked didn t suppose there was said plunkett mildly he ll do by any other name besides myself said bridger there are only two americans on ratona bob reeves and henry morgan the man i want sells cocoanuts suggested plunkett you see that cocoanut walk extending up to the point said the consul waving his hand toward the open door that belongs to bob reeves henry morgan owns half the trees to loo ard on the island one month ago said the sheriff wade williams wrote a confidential letter to a man in chatham county telling him where he was and how he was getting along the letter was lost and the person that found it gave it away they sent me after him and i ve got the papers i reckon he s one of your cocoanut men for certain you ve got his picture of course said bridger it might be reeves or morgan but i d hate to think it they re both as fine fellows as you d meet in an all day auto ride no doubtfully answered plunkett there wasn t any picture of williams to be had and i never saw him myself i ve been sheriff only a year but i ve got a pretty accurate description of him about feet dark hair and eyes nose inclined to be roman heavy about the shoulders strong white teeth with none miss ing laughs a good deal talkative drinks considerably but never to intoxication looks you square in the eye when talking age thirty five which one of your men does that description fit the consul grinned broadly i ll tell you what you do he said laying down his rifle and slipping on his dingy black alpaca coat you come along mr plunkett and i ll take you up to see the boys if you can tell which one of em your descrip tion fits better than it does the other you have the advan tage of me bridger conducted the sheriff out and along the hard beach close to which the tiny houses of the village were distributed immediately back of the town rose sudden small thickly wooded hills up one of these by means of steps cut in the hard clay the consul led plunkett the very verge of an eminence was perched a two room wooden cottage with a thatched roof a carib woman was washing clothes outside the consul ushered the sheriff to the door of the room that over looked the harbour two men were in the room about to sit down in their shirt sleeves to a table spread for dinner they bore little resemblance one to the other in detail but the general description given by plunkett could have been justly applied to either in height colour of hair shape of nose build and manners each of them tallied with it they were fair types of jovial ready witted broad gauged americans who had gravitated together for com panionship in an alien land hello bridger they called in unison at sight of the consul come and have dinner with us and then they noticed plunkett at his heels and came forward with hospitable curiosity gentlemen said the consul his voice taking on unaccustomed formality this is mr plunkett mr plunkett mr reeves and mr morgan the cocoanut barons greeted the newcomer joyously reeves seemed about an inch taller than morgan but his laugh was not quite as loud morgan s eyes were deep brown reeves s were black reeves was the host and busied himself with fetching other chairs and calling to the carib woman for supplemental table ware it was explained that morgan lived in a bamboo shack to loo ard but that every day the two friends dined together plunkett stood still during the preparations looking about mildly with his pale blue eyes bridger looked apologetic and uneasy at length two other covers were laid and the company was assigned to places reeves and morgan stood side by side across the table from the visitors reeves nodded genially as a signal for all to seat themselves and then suddenly plunkett raised his hand with a gesture of authority he was looking straight between reeves and morgan wade williams he said quietly you are under arrest for murder reeves and morgan instantly exchanged a quick bright glance the quality of which was interrogation with a seasoning of surprise then simultaneously they turned to the speaker with a puzzled and frank depre cation in their gaze can t say that we understand you mr plunkett said morgan cheerfully did you say williams what s the joke bridgy asked reeves turning to the consul with a smile before bridger could answer plunkett spoke again i ll explain he said quietly one of you don t need any explanation but this is for the other one one of you is wade williams of chatham county kentucky you murdered your wife on may two years ago after ill treating and abusing her continually for five years i have the proper papers in my pocket for taking you back with me and you are going we will return on the fruit steamer that comes back by this island to morrow to leave its inspectors i acknowledge gentlemen that i m not quite sure which one of you is williams but wade williams goes back to chatham county to morrow i want you to understand that a great sound of merry laughter from morgan and reeves went out over the still harbour two or three fishermen in the fleet of sloops anchored there looked up at the house of the diablos americanos on the hill and wondered my dear mr plunkett cried morgan conquering his mirth the dinner is getting cold let us sit down and eat i am anxious to get my spoon into that shark fin soup business afterward sit down gentlemen if you please added reeves pleasantly i am sure mr plunkett will not object perhaps a little time may be of advantage to him in identi fying the gentlemen he wishes to arrest no objections i m sure said plunkett dropping into his chair heavily i m hungry myself i didn t want to accept the hospitality of you folks without giving you notice that s all reeves set bottles and glasses on the table there s cognac he said and anisada and scotch smoke and rye take your choice bridger chose rye reeves poured three fingers of scotch for himself morgan took the same the sheriff against much protestation filled his glass from the water bottle here s to the appetite said reeves raising his glass of mr williams morgan s laugh and his drink encountering sent him into a choking splutter all began to pay attention to the dinner which was well cooked and palatable williams called plunkett suddenly and sharply all looked up wonderingly reeves found the sheriff s mild eye resting upon him he flushed a little see here he said with some asperity my name s reeves and i don t want you too but the comedy of the thing came to his rescue and he ended with a laugh i suppose mr plunkett said morgan carefully seasoning an alligator pear that you are aware of the fact that you will import a good deal of trouble for your self into kentucky if you take back the wrong man that is of course if you take anybody back thank you for the salt said the sheriff oh i ll take somebody back it ll be one of you two gentlemen yes i know i d get stuck for damages if i make a mis take but i m going to try to get the right man i ll tell you what you do said morgan leaning for ward with a jolly twinkle in his eyes you take me i ll go without any trouble the cocoanut business hasn t panned out well this year and i d like to make some extra money out of your bondsmen that s not fair chimed in reeves i got only a thousand for my last shipment take me mr plunkett i ll take wade williams said the sheriff patiently or i ll come pretty close to it it s like dining with a ghost remarked morgan with a pretended shiver the ghost of a murderer too will somebody pass the toothpicks to the shade of the naughty mr williams plunkett seemed as unconcerned as if he were dining at his own table in chatham county he was a gallant trencherman and the strange tropic viands tickled his palate heavy commonplace almost slothful in his movements he appeared to be devoid of all the cunning and watchfulness of the sleuth he even ceased to observe with any sharpness or attempted discrimination the two men one of whom he had undertaken with sur prising self confidence to drag away upon the serious charge of wife murder here indeed was a problem set before him that if wrongly solved would have amounted to his serious discomfiture yet there he sat puzzling his soul to all appearances over the novel flavour of a broiled iguana cutlet the consul felt a decided discomfort reeves and morgan were his friends and pals yet the sheriff from kentucky had a certain right to his official aid and moral support so bridger sat the silentest around the board and tried to estimate the peculiar situation his con clusion was that both reeves and morgan quickwitted as he knew them to be had conceived at the moment of plunkett s disclosure of his mission and in the brief space of a lightning flash the idea that the other might be the guilty williams and that each of them had decided in that moment loyally to protect his comrade against the doom that threatened him this was the consul s theory and if he had been a bookmaker at a race of wits for life and liberty he would have offered heavy odds against the plodding sheriff from chatham county kentucky when the meal was concluded the carib woman came and removed the dishes and cloth reeves strewed them table with excellent cigars and plunkett with the others lighted one of these with evident gratification i may be dull said morgan with a grin and a wink at bridger but i want to know if i am now i say this is all a joke of mr plunkett s concocted to frighten two babes in the woods is this williamson to be taken seriously or not williams corrected plunkett gravely i never got off any jokes in my life i know i wouldn t travel miles to get off a poor one as this would be if i didn t take wade williams back with me gentlemen continued the sheriff now letting his mild eyes travel impartially from one of the company to another see if you can find any joke in this case wade williams is listening to the words i utter now but out of politeness i will speak of him as a third person for five years he made his wife lead the life of a dog no i ll take that back no dog in kentucky was ever treated as she was he spent the money that she brought him spent it at races at the card table and on horses and hunting he was a good fellow to his friends but a cold sullen demon at home he wound up the five years of neglect by strik ing her with his closed hand a hand as hard as a stone when she was ill and weak from suffering she died the next day and he skipped that s all there is to it it s enough i never saw williams but i knew his wife i m not a man to tell half she and i were keep ing company when she met him she went to louisville on a visit and saw him there i ll admit that he spoilt my chances in no time i lived then on the edge of the cumberland mountains i was elected sheriff of chatham county a year after wade williams killed his wife my official duty sends me out here after him but i ll admit that there s personal feeling too and he s going back with me mr er reeves will you pass me a match awfully imprudent of williams said morgan putting his feet up against the wall to strike a kentucky lady seems to me i ve heard they were scrappers bad bad williams said reeves pouring out more scotch the two men spoke lightly but the consul saw and felt the tension and the carefulness in their actions and words good old fellows he said to himself they re both all right each of em is standing by the other like a little brick church and then a dog walked into the room where they sat a black and tan hound long eared lazy confident of welcome plunkett turned his head and looked at the animal which halted confidently within a few feet of his chair suddenly the sheriff with a deep mouthed oath left his seat and bestowed upon the dog a vicious and heavy kick with his ponderous shoe the hound heartbroken astonished with flapping ears and incurved tail uttered a piercing yelp of pain and surprise reeves and the consul remained in their chairs say ing nothing but astonished at the unexpected show of intolerance from the easy going man from chatham county but morgan with a suddenly purpling face leaped to his feet and raised a threatening arm above the guest you brute he shouted passionately why did you do that quickly the amenities returned plunkett muttered some indistinct apology and regained his seat morgan with a decided effort controlled his indignation and also returned to his chair and then plunkett with the spring of a tiger leaped around the corner of the table and snapped handcuffs on the paralyzed morgan s wrists hound lover and woman killer he cried get ready to meet your god when bridger had finished i asked him did he get the right man he did said the consul and how did he know i inquired being in a kind of bewilderment when he put morgan in the dory answered bridger the next day to take him aboard the pajaro this man plunkett stopped to shake hands with me and i asked him the same question mr bridger said he i m a kentuckian and i ve seen a great deal of both men and animals and i never yet saw a man that was overfond of horses and dogs but what was cruel to women the hypotheses of failure lawyer gooch bestowed his undivided attention upon the engrossing arts of his profession but one flight of fancy did he allow his mind to entertain he was fond of likening his suite of office rooms to the bot tom of a ship the rooms were three in number with a door opening from one to another these doors could also be closed ships lawyer gooch would say are constructed for safety with separate water tight compartments in their bottoms if one compartment springs a leak it fills with water but the good ship goes on unhurt were it not for the separating bulkheads one leak would sink the vessel now it often happens that while i am occu pied with clients other clients with conflicting interests call with the assistance of archibald an office boy with a future i cause the dangerous influx to be diverted into separate compartments while i sound with my legal plummet the depth of each if neces sary they may be haled into the hallway and permitted to escape by way of the stairs which we may term the lee scuppers thus the good ship of business is kept afloat whereas if the element that supports her were allowed to mingle freely in her hold we might be swamped ha ha ha the law is dry good jokes are few surely it might be permitted lawyer gooch to mitigate the bore of briefs the tedium of torts and the prosiness of processes with even so light a levy upon the good property of humour lawyer gooch s practice leaned largely to the settle ment of marital infelicities did matrimony languish through complications he mediated soothed and arbi trated did it suffer from implications he readjusted defended and championed did it arrive at the extremity of duplications he always got light sentences for his clients but not always was lawyer gooch the keen armed wily belligerent ready with his two edged sword to lop off the shackles of hymen he had been known to build up instead of demolishing to reunite instead of severing to lead erring and foolish ones back into the fold instead of scattering the flock often had he by his eloquent and moving appeals sent husband and wife weeping back into each other s arms frequently he had coached childhood so successfully that at the psychological moment and at a given signal the plaintive pipe of papa won t you turn home adain to me and muvver had won the day and upheld the pillars of a tottering home unprejudiced persons admitted that lawyer gooch received as big fees from these revoked clients as would have been paid him had the cases been contested in court prejudiced ones intimated that his fees were doubled because the penitent couples always came back later for the divorce anyhow there came a season in june when the legal ship of lawyer gooch to borrow his own figure was nearly becalmed the divorce mill grinds slowly in june it is the month of cupid and hymen lawyer gooch then sat idle in the middle room of his clientless suite a small anteroom connected or rather separated this apartment from the hallway here was stationed archibald who wrested from visitors their cards or oral nomenclature which he bore to his master while they waited suddenly on this day there came a great knocking at the outermost door archibald opening it was thrust aside as superfluous by the visitor who without due reverence at once pene trated to the office of lawyer gooch and threw himself with good natured insolence into a comfortable chair facing that gentlemen you are phineas c gooch attorney at law said the visitor his tone of voice and inflection making his words at once a question an assertion and an accusation before committing himself by a reply the lawyer esti mated his possible client in one of his brief but shrewd and calculating glances the man was of the emphatic type large sized active bold and debonair in demeanour vain beyond a doubt slightly swaggering ready and at ease he was well clothed but with a shade too much ornateness he was seeking a lawyer but if that fact would seem to saddle him with troubles they were not patent in his beaming eye and courageous air my name is gooch at length the lawyer admitted upon pressure he would also have confessed to the phineas c but he did not consider it good practice to volunteer information i did not receive your card he continued by way of rebuke so i i know you didn t remarked the visitor coolly and you won t just yet light up he threw a leg over an arm of his chair and tossed a handful of rich hued cigars upon the table lawyer gooch knew the brand he thawed just enough to accept the invitation to smoke you are a divorce lawyer said the cardless visitor this time there was no interrogation in his voice nor did his words constitute a simple assertion they formed a charge a denunciation as one would say to a dog you are a dog lawyer gooch was silent under the imputation you handle continued the visitor all the various ramifications of busted up connubiality you are a surgeon we might saw who extracts cupid s darts when he shoots em into the wrong parties you furnish patent incandescent lights for premises where the torch of hymen has burned so low you can t light a cigar at it am i right mr gooch i have undertaken cases said the lawyer guardedly in the line to which your figurative speech seems to refer do you wish to consult me professionally mr the lawyer paused with significance not yet said the other with an arch wave of his cigar not just yet let us approach the subject with the caution that should have been used in the original act that makes this pow wow necessary there exists a matrimonial jumble to be straightened out but before i give you names i want your honest well anyhow your professional opinion on the merits of the mix up i want you to size up the catastrophe abstractly you understand i m mr nobody and i ve got a story to tell you then you say what s what do you get my wireless you want to state a hypothetical case suggested lawyer gooch that s the word i was after apothecary was the best shot i could make at it in my mind the hypo thetical goes i ll state the case suppose there s a woman a deuced fine looking woman who has run away from her husband and home she s badly mashed on another man who went to her town to work up some real estate business now we may as well call this woman s husband thomas r billings for that s his name i m giving you straight tips on the cognomens the lothario chap is henry k jessup the billingses lived in a little town called susanville a good many miles from here now jessup leaves susanville two weeks ago the next day mrs billings follows him she s dead gone on this man jessup you can bet your law library on that lawyer gooch s client said this with such unctuous satisfaction that even the callous lawyer experienced a slight ripple of repulsion he now saw clearly in his fatuous visitor the conceit of the lady killer the egoistic complacency of the successful trifler now continued the visitor suppose this mrs billings wasn t happy at home we ll say she and her husband didn t gee worth a cent they ve got incom patibility to burn the things she likes billings wouldn t have as a gift with trading stamps it s tabby and rover with them all the time she s an educated woman in science and culture and she reads things out loud at meetings billings is not on he don t appreciate pro gress and obelisks and ethics and things of that sort old billings is simply a blink when it comes to such things the lady is out and out above his class now lawyer don t it look like a fair equalization of rights and wrongs that a woman like that should be allowed to throw down billings and take the man that can appreciate her incompatibility said lawyer gooch is undoubt edly the source of much marital discord and unhappiness where it is positively proved divorce would seem to be the equitable remedy are you excuse me is this man jessup one to whom the lady may safely trust her future oh you can bet on jessup said the client with a confident wag of his head jessup s all right he ll do the square thing why he left susanville just to keep pwple from talking about mrs billings but she fol lowed him up and now of course he ll stick to her when she gets a divorce all legal and proper jessup the proper thing and now said lawyer gooch continuing the hypo if you prefer and supposing that my services should ired in the case what the client rose impulsively to his feet oh dang the hypothetical business he exclaimed impatiently let s let her drop and get down to straight talk you ought to know who i am by this time i want that woman to have her divorce i ll pay for it the day you set mrs billings free i ll pay you five hundred dollars lawyer gooch s client banged his fist upon the table to punctuate his generosity if that is the case began the lawyer lady to see you sir bawled archibald bouncing in from his anteroom he had orders to always announce immediately any client that might come there was no sense in turning business away lawyer gooch took client number one by the arm and led him suavely into one of the adjoining rooms favour me by remaining here a few minutes sir said he i will return and resume our consultation with the least possible delay i am rather expecting a visit from a very wealthy old lady in connection with a will i will not keep you waiting long the breezy gentleman seated himself with obliging acquiescence aud took up a magazine the lawyer returned to the middle office carefully closing behind him the connecting door show the lady in archibald he said to the office boy who was awaiting the order a tall lady of commanding presence and sternly hand some entered the room she wore robes robes not clothes ample and fluent in her eye could be per ceived the lambent flame of genius and soul in her hand was a green bag of the capacity of a bushel and an umbrella that also seemed to wear a robe ample and fluent she accepted a chair are you mr phineas c gooch the lawyer she asked in formal and unconciliatory tones i am answered lawyer gooch without circum locution he never circumlocuted when dealing with a woman women circumlocute time is wasted when both sides in debate employ the same tactics as a lawyer sir began the lady you may have acquired some knowledge of the human heart do you believe that the pusillanimous and petty conventions of our artificial social life should stand as an obstacle in the way of a noble and affectionate heart when it finds its true mate among the miserable and worthless wretches in the world that are called men madam said lawyer gooch in the tone that he used in curbing his female clients this is an office for conducting the practice of law i am a lawyer not a philosopher nor the editor of an answers to the lovelorn column of a newspaper i have other clients waiting i will ask you kindly to come to the point well you needn t get so stiff around the gills about it said the lady with a snap of her luminous eves and a startling gyration of her umbrella business is what i ve come for i want your opinion in the matter of a suit for divorce as the vulgar would call it but which is really only the readjustment of the false and ignoble con ditions that the short sihhted laws of man have interposed between a loving i beg your pardon madam interrupted lawyer gooch with some impatience for reminding you again that this is a law office perhaps mrs wilcox mrs wilcox is all right cut in the lady with a hint of asperity and so are tolstoi and mrs gertrude atherton and omar khayyam and mr edward bok i ve read em all i would like to discuss with you the divine right of the soul as opposed to the freedom destroy ing restrictions of a bigoted and narrow minded society but i will proceed to business i would prefer to lay the matter before you in an impersonal way until vou pass upon its merits that is to describe it as a sup posable instance without you wish to state a hypothetical case said lawyer gooch i was going to say that said the lady sharply now suppose there is a woman who is all soul and heart and aspirations for a complete existence this woman has a husband who is far below her in intellect in taste in everything bah he is a brute he despises literature he sneers at the lofty thoughts of the world s great thinkers he thinks only of real estate and such sordid things he is no mate for a woman with soul we will say that this unfortunate wife one day meets with her ideal a man with brain and heart and force she loves him although this man feels the thrill of a new found affinity he is too noble too honourable to declare himself he flies from the presence of his beloved she flies after him trampling with superb indifference upon the fetters with which an unenlightened social system would bind her now what will a divorce cost eliza ann timmins the poetess of sycamore gap got one for three hundred and forty dollars can i i mean can this lady i speak of get one that cheap madam said lawyer gooch your last two or three sentences delight me with their intelligence and clearness can we not now abandon the hypothetical and come down to names and business i should say so exclaimed the lady adopting the practical with admirable readiness thomas r bil lings is the name of the low brute who stands between the happiness of his legal his legal but not his spiri tual wife and henry k jessup the noble man whom nature intended for her mate i concluded the client with an air of dramatic revelation am mrs billings gentlemen to see you sir shouted archibald invad ing the room almost at a handspring lawyer gooch arose from his chair mrs billings he said courteously allow me to conduct you into the adjoining office apartment for a few minutes i am expecting a very wealthy old gentleman on busines connected with a will in a very short while i will join you and continue our consultation with his accustomed chivalrous manner lawyer gooch ushered his soulful client into the remaining unoccupied room and came out closing the door with circumspection the next visitor introduced by archibald was a thin nervous irritable looking man of middle age with a worried and apprehensive expression of countenance he carried in one hand a small satchel which he set down upon the floor beside the chair which the lawyer placed for him his clothing was of good quality but it was worn without regard to neatness or style and appeared to be covered with the dust of travel you make a specialty of divorce cases he said in an agitated but business like tone i may say began lawyer gooch that my prac tice has not altogether avoided i know you do interrupted client number three you needn t tell me i ve heard all about you i have a case to lay before you without necessarily disclosing any connection that i might have with it that is you wish said lawyer gooch to state a hvpo thetical case you may call it that i am a plain man of business i will be as brief as possible we will first take up hypothetical woman we will say she is married uncon genially in many ways she is a superior woman phys ically she is considered to be handsome she is devoted to what she calls literature poetry and prose and such stuff her husband is a plain man in the business walks of life their home has not been happy although the husband has tried to make it so some time ago a man a stranger came to the peaceful town in which they lived and engaged in some real estate operations this woman met him and became unaccountably infatu ated with him her attentions became so open that the man felt the community to be no safe place for him so he left it she abandoned husband and home and followed him she forsook her home where she was provided with every comfort to follow this man who had inspired her with such a strange affection is there any thing more to be deplored concluded the client in a trembling voice than the wrecking of a home by a woman s uncalculating folly lawyer gooch delivered the cautious opinion that there was not this man she has gone to join resumed the visitor is not the man to make her happy it is a wild and foolish self deception that makes her think he will her husband in spite of their many disagreements is the only one capable of dealing with her sensitive and peculiar nature but this she does not realize now would you consider a divorce the logical cure in the case you present asked lawyer gooch who felt that the conversation was wandering too far from the field of business a divorce exclaimed the client feelingly almost tearfully no no not that i have read mr gooch of many instances where your sympathy and kindly inter est led you to act as a mediator between estranged hus band and wife and brought them together again let us drop the hypothetical case i need conceal no longer that it is i who am the sufferer in this sad affair the names you shall have thomas r billings and wife and henry k jessup the man with whom she is infatuated client number three laid his hand upon mr gooch s arm deep emotion was written upon his careworn face for heaven s sake he said fervently help me in this hour of trouble seek out mrs billings and persuade her to abandon this distressing pursuit of her lamentable folly tell her mr gooch that her husband is willing to receive her back to his heart and home promise her anything that will induce her to return i have heard of your success in these matters mrs bil lings cannot be very far away i am worn out with travel and weariness twice during the pursuit i saw her but various circumstances prevented our having an inter view will you undertake this mission for me mr gooch and earn my everlasting gratitude it is true said lawver gooch frowning slightly at the other s last words but immediately calling up an expression of virtuous benevolence that on a number of occasions i have been successful in persuading couples who sought the severing of their matrimonial bonds to think better of their rash intentions and return to their homes reconciled but i assure you that the work is often exceedingly difficult the amount of argument perseverance and if i may be allowed to say it eloquence that it requires would astonish you but this is a case in which my sympathies would be wholly enlisted i feel deeply for you sir and i would be most happy to see husband and wife reunited but my time concluded the lawyer looking at his watch as if suddenly reminded of the fact is valuable i am aware of that said the client and if you will take the case and persuade mrs billings to return home and leave the man alone that she is following on that day i will pay you the sum of one thousand dollars i have made a little money in real estate during the recent boom in susanville and i will not begrudge that amount retain your seat for a few moments please said lawyer gooch arising and again consulting his watch i have another client waiting in an adjoining room whom i had very nearly forgotten i will return in the briefest possible space the situation was now one that fully satisfied lawyer gooch s love of intricacy and complication he revelled in cases that presented such subtle problems and possi bilities it pleased him to think that he was master of the happiness and fate of the three individuals who sat uncon cious of one another s presence within his reach his old figure of the ship glided into his mind but now the figure failed for to have filled every compartment of an actual vessel would have been to endanger her safety with his compartments full his ship of affairs could but sail on to the advantageous port of a fine fat fee the thing for him to do of course was to wring the best bargain he could from some one of his anxious cargo first he called to the office boy lock the outer door archibald and admit no one then he moved with long silent strides into the room in which client number one waited that gentleman sat patiently scanning the pictures in the magazine with a cigar in his mouth and his feet upon a table well he remarked cheerfully as the lawyer entered have you made up your mind does five hundred dollars go for getting the fair lady a divorce you mean that as a retainer asked lawyer gooch softly interrogative hey no for the whole job it s enough ain t it my fee said lawyer gooch would be one thousand five hundred dollars five hundred dollars down and the remainder upon issuance of the divorce a loud whistle came from client number one his feet descended to the floor guess we can t close the deal he said arising i cleaned up five hunderd dollars in a little real estate dicker down in susanville i d do anything i could to free the lady but it out sizes my pile could you stand one thousand two hundred dollars asked the lawyer insinuatingly five hundred is my limit i tell you guess i ll have to hunt up a cheaper lawyer the client put on his hat out this way please said lawyer gooch opening the door that led into the hallway as the gentleman flowed out of the compartment and down the stairs lawyer gooch smiled to himself exit mr jessup he murmured as he fingered the henry clay tuft of hair at his ear and now for the forsaken husband he returned to the middle office and assumed a businesslike manner i understand he said to client number three that you agree to pay one thousand dollars if i bring about or am instrumental in bringing about the return of mrs billings to her home and her abandonment of her infatu ated pursuit of the man for whom she has conceived such a violent fancy also that the case is now unreservedly in my hands on that basis is that correct entirely said the other eagerly and i can produce the cash any time at two hours notice lawyer gooch stood up at his full height his thin figure seemed to expand his thumbs sought the arm holes of his vest upon his face was a look of sym pathetic benignity that he always wore during such undertakings then sir he said in kindly tones i think i can promise you an early relief from your troubles i have that much confidence in my powers of argument and persuasion in the natural impulses of the human heart toward good and in the strong influence of a husband s unfaltering love mrs billinos sir is here in that room the lawyer s long arm pointed to the door i will call her in at once and our united pleadings lawyer gooch paused for client number three had leaped from his chair as if propelled by steel springs and clutched his satchel what the devil he exclaimed harshly do vou mean that woman in there i thought i shook her off forty miles back he ran to the open window looked out below and threw one leg over the sill stop cried lawyer gooch in amazement what would you do come mr billings and face your erring but innocent wife our combined entreaties cannot fail to billings shouted the now thoroughly moved client i ll billings you you old idiot turning he hurled his satchel with fury at the lawyer s head it struck that astounded peacemaker between the eyes causing him to stagger backward a pace or two when lawyer gooch recovered his wits he saw that his client had disappeared rushing to the window he leaned out and saw the recreant gathering himself up from the top of a shed upon which he had dropped from the second story window without stopping to collect his hat he then plunged downward the remaining ten feet to the alley up which he flew with prodigious celerity until the surrounding building swallowed him up from view lawyer gooch passed his hand tremblingly across his brow it was a habitual act with him serving to clear his thoughts perhaps also it now seemed to soothe the spot where a very hard alligator hide satchel had struck the satchel lay upon the floor wide open with its con tents spilled about mechanically lawyer gooch stooped to gather up the articles the first was a collar and the omniscient eye of the man of law perceived wonder ingly the initials h k j marked upon it then came a comb a brush a folded map and a piece of soap lastly a handful of old business letters addressed every one of them to henry k jessup esq lawyer gooch closed the satchel and set it upon the table he hesitated for a moment and then put on his hat and walked into the office boy s anteroom archibald he said mildly as he opened the hall door i am going around to the supreme court rooms in five minutes you may step into the inner office and inform the lady who is waiting there that here lawyer gooch made use of the vernacular that there s nothing doing calloway s code the new york enterprise sent h b calloway as special correspondent to the russo japanese portsmouth war for two months calloway hung about yokohama and tokio shaking dice with the other correspondents for drinks of rickshaws oh no that s something to ride in anyhow he wasn t earning the salary that his paper was paying him but that was not calloway s fault the little brown men who held the strings of fate between their fingers were not ready for the readers of the enterprise to season their breakfast bacon and eggs with the battles of the descendants of the gods but soon the column of correspondents that were to go out with the first army tightened their field glass belts and went down to the yalu with kuroki calloway was one of these now this is no history of the battle of the yalu river that has been told in detail by the correspondents who gazed at the shrapnel smoke rings from a distance of three miles but for justice s sake let it be understood that the japanese commander prohibited a nearer view calloway s feat was accomplished before the battle what he did was to furnish the enterprise with the biggest beat of the war that paper published exclu sively and in detail the news of the attack on the lines of the russian general on the same day that it was made no other paper printed a word about it for two days afterward except a london paper whose account was absolutely incorrect and untrue calloway did this in face of the fact that general kuroki was making his moves and living his plans with the pro foundest secrecy as far as the world outside his camps was concerned the correspondents were forbidden to send out any news whatever of his plans and every message that was allowed on the wires was censored with rigid severity the correspondent for the london paper handed in a cablegram describing kuroki s plans but as it was wrong from beginning to end the censor grinned and let it go through so there they were kuroki on one side of the yalu with forty two thousand infantry five thousand cavalry and one hundred and twenty four guns on the other side zassulitch waited for him with only twenty three thousand men and with a long stretch of river to guard and calloway had got hold of some important inside information that he knew would bring the enterprise staff around a cablegram as thick as flies around a park row lemonade stand if he could only get that message past the censor the new censor who had arrived and taken his post that day calloway did the obviously proper thing he lit his pipe and sat down on a gun carriage to think it over and there we must leave him for the rest of the story belongs to vesey a sixteen dollar a week reporter on the enterprise calloway s cablegram was handed to the managing editor at four o clock in the afternoon he read it three times and then drew a pocket mirror from a pigeon hole in his desk and looked at his reflection carefully then he went over to the desk of boyd his assistant he usually called boyd when he wanted him and laid the cablegram before him it s from calloway he said see what you make of it the message was dated at wi ju and these were the words of it foregone preconcerted rash witching goes muffled rumour mine dark silent unfortunate richmond existing great hotly brute select mooted parlous beggars ye angel incontrovertible boyd read it twice it s either a cipher or a sunstroke said he ever hear of anything like a code in the office a secret code asked the m e who had held his desk for only two years managing editors come and go none except the vernacular that the lady specials write in said boyd couldn t be an acrostic could it i thought of that said the m e but the beginning letters contain only four vowels it must be a code of some sort try em in groups suggested boyd let s see rash witching goes not with me it doesn t muf fled rumour mine must have an underground wire dark silent unfortunate richmond no reason why he should knock that town so hard existing great hotly no it doesn t pan out i ll call scott the city editor came in a hurry and tried his luck a city editor must know something about everything so scott knew a little about cipher writing it may be what is called an inverted alphabet cipher said he i ll try that r seems to be the oftenest used initial letter with the exception of m assuming r to mean e the most frequently used vowel we transpose the letters so scott worked rapidly with his pencil for two minutes and then showed the first word according to his reading the word scejtzez great cried boyd it s a charade my first is a russian general go on scott no that won t work said the city editor it s undoubtedly a code it s impossible to read it without the key has the office ever used a cipher code just what i was asking said the m e hustle everybody up that ought to know we must get at it some way calloway has evidently got hold of some thing big and the censor has put the screws on or he wouldn t have cabled in a lot of chop suey like this throughout the office of the enterprise a dragnet was sent hauling in such members of the staff as would be likely to know of a code past or present by reason of their wisdom information natural intelligence or length of servitude they got together in a group in the city room with the m e in the centre no one had heard of a code all began to explain to the head investi gator that newspapers never use a code anyhow that is a cipher code of course the associated press stuff is a sort of code an abbreviation rather but the m e knew all that and said so he asked each man how long he had worked on the paper not one of them had drawn pay from an enterprise envelope for longer than six years calloway had been on the paper twelve years try old heffelbauer said the m e he was here when park row was a potato patch heffelbauer was an institution he was half janitor half handy man about the office and half watchman thus becoming the peer of thirteen and one half tailors sent for he came radiating his nationality heffelbauer said the m e did you ever hear of a code belonging to the office a long time ago a private code you know what a code is don t you yah said heffelbauer sure i know vat a code is yah apout dwelf or fifteen year ago der office had a code der reborters in der city room haf it here ah said the m e we re getting on the trail now where was it kept heffelbauer what do you know about it somedimes said the retainer dey keep it in der little room behind der library room can you find it asked the m e eagerly do you know where it is mein gott said heffelbauer how long you dink a code live der reborters call him a maskeet but von day he butt mit his head der editor und oh he s talking about a goat said boyd get out heffelbauer again discomfited the concerted wit and resource of the enterprise huddled around calloway s puzzle con sidering its mysterious words in vain then vesey came in vesey was the youngest reporter he had a thirty two inch chest and wore a number fourteen collar but his bright scotch plaid suit gave him presence and con ferred no obscurity upon his whereabouts he wore his hat in such a position that people followed him about to see him take it off convinced that it must be hung upon a peg driven into the back of his head he was never without an immense knotted hard wood cane with a german silver tip on its crooked handle vesey was the best photograph hustler in the office scott said it was because no living human being could resist the per sonal triumph it was to hand his picture over to vesey vesey always wrote his own news stories except the big ones which were sent to the rewrite men add to this fact that among all the inhabitants temples and groves of the earth nothing existed that could abash vesey and his dim sketch is concluded vesey butted into the circle of cipher readers very much as heffelbauer s code would have done and asked what was up some one explained with the touch of half familiar condescension that they always used toward him vesey reached out and took the cablegram from the m e s hand under the protection of some special providence he was always doing appalling things like that and coming off unscathed it s a code said vesey anybody got the key the office has no code said boyd reaching for the message vesey held to it then old callowav expects us to read it anyhow said he he s up a tree or something and he s made this up so as to get it by the censor it s up to us gee i wish they had sell me too say we can t afford to fall down on our end of it foregone preconcerted rash witching h m vesey sat down on a table corner and began to whistle softly frowning at the cablegram let s have it please said the m e we ve got to get to work on it i believe i ve got a line on it said vesey give me ten minutes he walked to his desk threw his hat into a waste basket spread out flat on his chest like a gorgeous lizard and started his pencil going the wit and wisdom of the enterprise remained in a loose group and smiled at one another nodding their heads toward vesey then they began to exchange their theories about the cipher it took vesey exactly fifteen minutes he brought to the m e a pad with the code key written on it i felt the swing of it as soon as i saw it said vesey hurrah for old calloway he s done the japs and every paper in town that prints literature instead of news take a look at that thus had vesey set forth the reading of the code foregone conclusion preconcerted arrangement rash act witching hour of midnight goes without saying muffled report rumour hath it mine host dark horse silent majority unfortunate pedestrians richmond in the field existing conditions great white way hotly contested brute force select few mooted question parlous times beggars description ye correspondent angel unawares incontrovertible fact mr vesey afterward explained that the logical journalistic complement of the word unfortunate was once the word victim but since the automobile became so popular the correct following word is now pedestrians of course in calloway s code it meant infantry it s simply newspaper english explained vesey i ve been reporting on the enterprise long enough to know it by heart old calloway gives us the cue word and we use the word that naturally follows it just as we em in the paper read it over and you ll see how pat they drop into their places now here s the message he intended us to get vesey handed out another sheet of paper concluded arrangement to act at hour of midnight without saying report hath it that a large body of cavalry and an overwhelming force of infantry will be thrown into the field conditions white way con tested by only a small force question the times description its correspondent is unaware of the facts great stuff cried boyd excitedly kuroki crosses the yalu to night and attacks oh we won t do a thing to the sheets that make up with addison s essays real estate transfers and bowling scores mr vesey said the m e with his jollying which you should regard as a favour manner you have cast a serious reflection upon the literary standards of the paper that employs you you have also assisted materially in giving us the biggest beat of the year i will let you know in a day or two whether you are to be discharged or retained at a larger salary somebody send ames to me ames was the king pin the snowy petalled marguerite the star bright looloo of the rewrite men he saw attempted murder in the pains of green apple colic cyclones in the summer zephyr lost children in every top spinning urchin an uprising of the down trodden masses in every hurling of a derelict potato at a passing automobile when not rewriting ames sat on the porch of his brooklyn villa playing checkers with his ten year old son ames and the war editor shut themselves in a room there was a map in there stuck full of little pins that represented armies and divisions their fingers had been itching for days to move those pins along the crooked line of the yalu they did so now and in words of fire ames translated calloway s brief message into a front page masterpiece that set the world talking he told of the secret councils of the japanese officers gave kuroki s flaming speeches in full counted the cavalry and infantry to a man and a horse described the quick and silent building of the bridge at stuikauchen across which the mikado s legions were hurled upon the surprised zassulitch whose troops were widely scattered along the river and the battle well you know what ames can do with a battle if you give him just one smell of smoke for a foundation and in the same story with seemingly supernatural knowledge he gleefully scored the most profound and ponderous paper in england for the false and misleading account of the intended movements of the japanese first army printed in its issue of the same date only one error was made and that was the fault of the cable operator at wi ju calloway pointed it out after he came back the word great in his code should have been gage and its complemental words of battle but it went to ames conditions white and of course he took that to mean snow his description of the japanese army strum struggling through the snowstorm blinded by the whirling flakes was thrillingly vivid the artists turned out some effective illustrations that made a hit as pictures of the artillery dragging their guns through the drifts but as the attack was made on the first day of may conditions white excited some amusement but it in made no difference to the enterprise anyway it was wonderful and calloway was wonderful in having made the new censor believe that his jargon of words meant no more than a complaint of the dearth of news and a petition for more expense money and vesey was wonderful and most wonderful of all are words and how they make friends one with another being oft associated until not even obituary notices them do part on the second day following the city editor halted at vesey s desk where the reporter was writing the story of a man who had broken his leg by falling into a coal hole ames having failed to find a murder motive in it the old man says your salary is to be raised to twenty a week said scott all right said vesey every little helps say mr scott which would you say we can state without fear of successful contradiction or on the whole it can be safely asserted a matter of mean elevation one winter the alcazar opera company of new orleans made a speculative trip along the mexican central american and south american coasts the venture proved a most successful one the music loving impressionable spanish americans deluged the company with dollars and vivas the manager waxed plump and amiable but for the prohibitive climate he would have put forth the distinctive flower of his prosperity the overcoat of fur braided frogged and opulent almost was he persuaded to raise the salaries of his company but with a mighty effort he conquered the impulse toward such an unprofitable effervescence of joy at macuto on the coast of venezuela the company scored its greatest success imagine coney island translated into spanish and you will comprehend macuto the fashionable season is from november to march down from la guayra and caracas and valencia and other interior towns flock the people for their holiday sea son there are bathing and fiestas and bull fights and scandal and then the people have a passion for music that the bands in the plaza and on the sea beach stir but do not satisfy the coming of the alcazar opera com pany aroused the utmost ardour and zeal among the pleasure seekers the illustrious guzman blanco president and dic tator of venezuela sojourned in macuto with his court for the season that potent ruler who himself paid a subsidy of pesos each year to grand opera in caracas ordered one of the government warehouses to be cleared for a temporary theatre a stage was quickly constructed and rough wooden benches made for the audience private boxes were added for the use of the president and the notables of the army and government the company remained in macuto for two weeks each performance filled the house as closely as it could be packed then the music mad people fought for room in the open doors and windows and crowded about hundreds deep on the outside those audiences formed a brilliantly diversified patch of colour the hue of their faces ranged from the clear olive of the pure blood span iards down through the yellow and brown shades of the mestizos to the coal black carib and the jamaica negro scattered among them were little groups of indians with faces like stone idols wrapped in gaudy fibre woven blankets indians down from the mountain states of zamora and los andes and miranda to trade their gold dust in the coast towns the spell cast upon these denizens of the interior fastnesses was remarkable they sat in petrified ecstasy conspicuous among the excitable macutians who wildly strove with tongue and hand to give evidence of their delight only once did the sombre rapture of these aboriginals find expression during the rendition of faust guzman blanco extravagantly pleased by the jewel song cast upon the stage a purse of gold pieces other distinguished citizens followed his lead to the extent of whatever loose coin they had convenient while some of the fair and fashionable se oras were moved in imita tion to fling a jewel or a ring or two at the feet of the marguerite who was according to the bills mlle nina giraud then from different parts of the house rose sundry of the stolid hillmen and cast upon the stage little brown and dun bags that fell with soft thumps and did not rebound it was no doubt pleasure at the tribute to her art that caused mlle giraud s eyes to shine so brightly when she opened these little deerskin bags in her dressing room and found them to contain pure gold dust if so the pleasure was rightly hers for her voice in song pure strong and thrilling with the feeling of the emotional artist deserved the tribute that it earned but the triumph of the alcazar opera company is not the theme it but leans upon and colours it there happened in macuto a tragic thing an unsolvable mystery that sobered for a time the gaiety of the happy season one evening between the short twilight and the time when she should have whirled upon the stage in the red and black of the ardent carmen mlle nina giraud dis appeared from the sight and ken of pairs of eyes and as many minds in macuto there was the usual turmoil and hurrying to seek her messengers flew to the little french kept hotel where she stayed others of the company hastened here or there where she might be lingering in some tienda or unduly prolonging her bath upon the beach all search was fruitless mademoi selle had vanished half an hour passed and she did not appear the dictator unused to the caprices of prime donne became impatient he sent an aide from his box to say to the manager that if the curtain did not at once rise he would immediately hale the entire company to the calabosa though it would desolate his heart indeed to be com pelled to such an act birds in macuto could be made to sing the manager abandoned hope for the time of mlle giraud a member of the chorus who had dreamed hopelessly for years of the blessed opportunity quickly carmenized herself and the opera went on afterward when the lost cantatrice appeared not the aid of the authorities was invoked the president at once set the army the police and all citizens to the search not one clue to mlle giraud s disappearance was found the alcazar left to fill engagements farther down the coast on the way back the steamer stopped at macuto and the manager made anxious inquiry not a trace of the lady had been discovered the alcazar could do no more the personal belongings of the missing lady were stored in the hotel against her possible later reappearance and the opera company continued upon its homeward voyage to new orleans on the camino real along the beach the two saddle mules and the four pack mules of don se or johnny armstrong stood patiently awaiting the crack of the whip of the arriero luis that would be the signal for the start on another long journey into the mountains the pack mules were loaded with a varied assortment of hard ware and cutlery these articles don johnny traded to the interior indians for the gold dust that they washed from the andean streams and stored in quills and bags against his coming it was a profitable business and se or armstrong expected soon to be able to purchase the coffee plantation that he coveted armstrong stood on the narrow sidewalk exchanging garbled spanish with old peralto the rich native merchant who had just charged him four prices for half a gross of pot metal hatchets and abridged english with rucker the little german who was consul for the united states take with you se or said peralto the blessings of the saints upon your journey better try quinine growled rucker through his pipe take two grains every night and don t make your trip too long johnny because we haf needs of you it is ein villainous game dot melville play of whist and dere is no oder substitute auf wiedersehen und keep your eyes dot mule s ears between when you on der edge of der brecipices ride the bells of luis s mule jingled and the pack train filed after the warning note armstrong waved a good bye and took his place at the tail of the procession up the narrow street they turned and passed the two story wooden hotel ingles where ives and dawson and rich ards and the rest of the chaps were dawdling on the broad piazza reading week old newspapers they crowded to the railing and shouted many friendly and wise and foolish farewells after him across the plaza they trotted slowly past the bronze statue of guzman blanco within its fence of bayoneted rifles captured from revolutionists and out of the town between the rows of thatched huts swarming with the unclothed youth of macuto they plunged into the damp coolness of banana groves at length to emerge upon a bright stream where brown women in scant raiment laundered clothes destructively upon the rocks then the pack train fording the stream attacked the sudden ascent and bade adieu to such civilization as the coast afforded for weeks armstrong guided by luis followed his regular route among the mountains after he had col lected an arroba of the precious metal winning a profit of nearly the heads of the lightened mules were turned down trail again where the head of the guarico river springs from a great gash in the mountain side luis halted the train half a day s journey from here se or said he is the village of tacuzama which we have never visited i think many ounces of gold may be procured there it is worth the trial armstrong concurred and they turned again upward toward tacuzama the trail was abrupt and precipi tous mounting through a dense forest as night fell dark and gloomy luis once more halted before them was a black chasm bisecting the path as far as they could see luis dismounted there should be a bridge he called and ran along the cleft a distance it is here he cried and remounting led the way in a few moments armstrong heard a sound as though a thunderous drum were beating somewhere in the dark it was the falling of the mules hoofs upon the bridge made of strong hides lashed to poles and stretched across the chasm half a mile further was tacuzama the village was a congre gation of rock and mud huts set in the profundity of an obscure wood as they rode in a sound inconsistent with that brooding solitude met their ears from a long low mud hut that they were nearing rose the glorious voice of a woman in song the words were english the air familiar to armstrong s memory but not to his musical knowledge he slipped from his mule and stole to a narrow window in one end of the house peering cautiously inside he saw within three feet of him a woman of marvellous imposing beauty clothed in a splendid loose robe of leopard skins the hut was packed close to the small space in which she stood with the squatting figures of indians the woman finished her song and seated herself close to the little window as if grateful for the unpolluted air that entered it when she had ceased several of the audience rose and cast little softly falling bags at her feet a harsh murmur no doubt a barbarous kind of applause and comment went through the grim assembly armstrong was used to seizing opportunities promptly taking advantage of the noise he called to the woman in a low but distinct voice do not turn your head this way but listen i am an american if you need assistance tell me how i can render it answer as briefly as you can the woman was worthy of his boldness only by a sudden flush of her pale cheek did she acknowledge understanding of his words then she spoke scarcely moving her lips i am held a prisoner by these indians god knows i need help in two hours come to the little hut twenty yards toward the mountainside there will be a light and a red curtain in the window there is always a guard at the door whom you will have to overcome for the love of heaven do not fail to come the story seems to shrink from adventure and rescue and mystery the theme is one too gentle for those brave and quickening tones and yet it reaches as far back as time itself it has been named environment which is as weak a word as any to express the unnameable kinship of man to nature that queer fraternity that causes stones and trees and salt water and clouds to play upon our emotions why are we made serious and solemn and sublime by mountain heights grave and contempla tive by an abundance of overhanging trees reduced to inconstancy and monkey capers by the ripples on a sandy beach did the protoplasm but enough the chem ists are looking into the matter and before long they will have all life in the table of the symbols briefly then in order to confine the story within scientific bounds john armstrong went to the hut choked the indian guard and carried away mlle giraud with her was also conveyed a number of pounds of gold dust she had collected during her six months forced engage ment in tacuzama the carabobo indians are easily the most enthusiastic lovers of music between the equator and the french opera house in new orleans they are also strong believers that the advice of emerson was good when he said the thing thou wantest discon tented man take it and pay the price a number of them had attended the performance of the alcazar opera company in macuto and found mlle giraud s style and technique satisfactory they wanted her so they took her one evening suddenly and without any fuss they treated her with much consideration exacting only one song recital each day she was quite pleased at being rescued by mr armstrong so much for mystery and adventure now to resume the theory of the proto plasm john armstrong and mlle giraud rode among the andean peaks enveloped in their greatness and sublimity the mightiest cousins furthest removed in nature s great family become conscious of the tie among those huge piles of primordial upheaval amid those gigantic silences and elongated fields of distance the littlenesses of men are precipitated as one chemical throws down a sediment from another they moved reverently as in a temple their souls were uplifted in unison with the stately heights they travelled in a zone of majesty and peace to armstrong the woman seemed almost a holy thing yet bathed in the white still dignity of her martyrdom that purified her earthly beauty and gave out it seemed an aura of transcendent loveliness in those first hours of companionship she drew from him an adoration that was half human love half the worship of a descended goddess never yet since her rescue had she smiled over her dress she still wore the robe of leopard skins for mountain air was cold she looked to be some splendid princess belonging to those wild and awesome altitudes the spirit of the region chimed with hers her eyes were always turned upon the sombre cliffs the blue gorges and the snow clad turrets looking a sublime melancholy equal to their own at times on the journey she sang thrilling te deums and misereres that struck the true note of the hills and made their route seem like a solemn march down a cathedral aisle the rescued one spoke but seldom her mood partaking of the hush of nature that surrounded them armstrong looked upon her as an angel he could not bring himself to the sacrilege of attempting to woo her as other women may be wooed on the third day they had descended as far as the tierra templada the zona of the table lands and foot hills the mountains were receding in their rear but still towered exhibiting yet impressively their formidable heads here they met signs of man they saw the white houses of coffee plantations gleam across the clear ings they struck into a road where they met travellers and pack mules cattle were grazing on the slopes they passed a little village where the round eyed ni os shrieked and called at sight of them mlle giraud laid aside her leopard skin robe it seemed to be a trifle incongruous now in the moun tains it had appeared fitting and natural and if arm strong was not mistaken she laid aside with it something of the high dignity of her demeanour as the country became more populous and significant of comfortable life he saw with a feeling of joy that the exalted princess and priestess of the andean peaks was changing to a woman an earth woman but no less enticing a little colour crept to the surface of her marble cheek she arranged the conventional dress that the removal of the robe now disclosed with the solicitous touch of one who is conscious of the eyes of others she smoothed the careless sweep of her hair a mundane interest long latent in the chilling atmosphere of the ascetic peaks showed in her eyes this thaw in his divinity sent armstrong s heart going faster so might an arctic explorer thrill at his first ken of green fields and liquescent waters they were on a lower plane of earth and life and were succumbing to its peculiar subtle influence the austerity of the hills no longer thinned the air they breathed about them was the breath of fruit and corn and builded homes the comfortable smell of smoke and warm earth and the consolations man has placed between himself and the dust of his brother earth from which he sprung while traversing those awful mountains mile giraud had seemed to be wrapped in their spirit of reverent reserve was this that same woman now palpitating warm eager throbbing with conscious life and charm feminine to her finger tips pondering over this armstrong felt certain misgivings intrude upon his thoughts he wished he could stop there with this changing creature descending no farther here was the elevation and environment to which her nature seemed to respond with its best he feared to go down upon the man dominated levels would her spirit not yield still further in that artificial zone to which they were descending now from a little plateau they saw the sea flash at the edge of the green lowlands mile giraud gave a little catching sigh oh look mr armstrong there is the sea isn t it lovely i m so tired of mountains she heaved a pretty shoulder in a gesture of repugnance those horrid indians just think of what i suffered although i suppose i attained my ambition of becoming a stellar attraction i wouldn t care to repeat the engagement it was very nice of you to bring me away tell me mr armstrong honestly now do i look such an awful awful fright i haven t looked into a mirror you know for months armstrong made answer according to his changed moods also he laid his hand upon hers as it rested upon the horn of her saddle luis was at the head of the pack train and could not see she allowed it to remain there and her eyes smiled frankly into his then at sundown they dropped upon the coast level under the palms and lemons among the vivid greens and searlets and ochres of the tierra caliente they rode into macuto and saw the line of volatile bathers frolick ing in the surf the mountains were very far away mlle giraud s eyes were shining with a joy that could not have existed under the chaperonage of the mountain tops there were other spirits calling to her nymphs of the orange groves pixies from the chattering surf imps born of the music the perfumes colours and the insinuating presence of humanity she laughed aloud musically at a sudden thought won t there be a sensation she called to armstrong don t i wish i had an engagement just now though what a picnic the press agent would have held a prisoner by a band of savage indians subdued by the spell of her wonderful voice wouldn t that make great stuff but i guess i quit the game winner anyhow there ought to be a couple of thousand dollars in that sack of gold dust i collected as encores don t you think he left her at the door of the little hotel de buen descansar where she had stopped before two hours later he returned to the hotel he glanced in at the open door of the little combined reception room and cafe half a dozen of macuto s representative social and official caballeros were distributed about the room sefior villablanca the wealthy rubber concessionist reposed his fat figure on two chairs with an emollient smile beaming upon his chocolate coloured face guil bert the french mining engineer leered through his polished nose glasses colonel mendez of the regular army in gold laced uniform and fatuous grin was busily extracting corks from champagne bottles other pat terns of macutian gallantry and fashion pranced and posed the air was hazy with cigarette smoke wine dripped upon the floor perched upon a table in the centre of the room in an attitude of easy preeminence was mlle giraud a chic costume of white lawn and cherry ribbons supplanted her travelling garb there was a suggestion of lace and a frill or two with a discreet small implication of hand embroidered pink hosiery upon her lap rested a guitar in her face was the light of resurrection the peace of elysium attained through fire and suffering she was singing to a lively accompaniment a little song when you see de big round moon comin up like a balloon dis nigger skips fur to kiss de lips ob his stylish black faced coon the singer caught sight of armstrong hi there johnny she called i ve been expecting you for an hour what kept you gee but these smoked guys are the slowest you ever saw they ain t on at all come along in and i ll make this coffee coloured old sport with the gold epaulettes open one for you right off the ice thank you said armstrong not just now i believe i ve several things to attend to he walked out and down the street and met rucker coming up from the consulate play you a game of billiards said armstrong i want something to take the taste of the sea level out of my mouth girl in gilt letters on the ground glass of the door of room no were the words robbins hartley brokers the clerks had gone it was past five and with the solid tramp of a drove of prize percherons scrub women were invading the cloud capped twenty story office building a puff of red hot air flavoured with lemon peelings soft coal smoke and train oil came in through the half open windows robbins fifty something of an overweight beau and addicted to first nights and hotel palm rooms pretended to be envious of his partner s commuter s joys going to be something doing in the humidity line to night he said you out of town chaps will be the people with your katydids and moonlight and long drinks and things out on the front porch hartley twenty nine serious thin good looking ner vous sighed and frowned a little yes said he we always have cool nights in floral hurst especially in the winter a man with an air of mystery came in the door and went up to hartley i ve found where she lives he announced in the portentous half whisper that makes the detective at work a marked being to his fellow men hartley scowled him into a state of dramatic silence and quietude but by that time robbins had got his cane and set his tie pin to his liking and with a debonair nod went out to his metropolitan amusements here is the address said the detective in a natural tone being deprived of an audience to foil hartley took the leaf torn out of the sleuth s dingy memorandum book on it were pencilled the words vivienne arlington no east th street care of mrs mccomus moved there a week ago said the detective now if you want any shadowing done mr hartley i can do you as fine a job in that line as anybody in the city it will be only a day and expenses can send in a daily typewritten report covering you needn t go on interrupted the broker it isn t a case of that kind i merely wanted the address how much shall i pay you one day s work said the sleuth a tenner will cover it hartley paid the man and dismissed him then he left the office and boarded a broadway car at the first large crosstown artery of travel he took an eastbound car that deposited him in a decaying avenue whose ancient structures once sheltered the pride and glory of the town walking a few squares he came to the building that he sought it was a new flathouse bearing carved upon its cheap stone portal its sonorous name the vallambrosa fire escapes zigzagged down its front these laden with household goods drying clothes and squalling children evicted by the midsummer heat here and there a pale rubber plant peeped from the miscellaneous mass as if wondering to what kingdom it belonged vegetable animal or artificial hartley pressed the mccomus button the door latch clicked spasmodically now hospitably now doubt fully as though in anxiety whether it might be admitting friends or duns hartley entered and began to climb the stairs after the manner of those who seek their friends in city flat houses which is the manner of a boy who climbs an apple tree stopping when he comes upon what he wants on the fourth floor he saw vivienne standing in an open door she invited him inside with a nod and a bright genuine smile she placed a chair for him near a window and poised herself gracefully upon the edge of one of those jekyll and hyde pieces of furniture that are masked and mysteriously hooded unguessable bulks by day and inquisitorial racks of torture by night hartley cast a quick critical appreciative glance at her before speaking and told himself that his taste in choosing had been flawless vivienne was about twenty one she was of the purest saxon type her hair was a ruddy golden each filament of the neatly gathered mass shining with its own lustre and delicate graduation of colour in perfect harmony were her ivory clear complexion and deep sea blue eyes that looked upon the world with the ingenuous calmness of a mermaid or the pixie of an undiscovered mountain stream her frame was strong and yet possessed the grace of absolute naturalness and yet with all her north ern clearness and frankness of line and colouring there seemed to be something of the tropics in her something of languor in the droop of her pose of love of ease in her ingenious complacency of satisfaction and comfort in the mere act of breathing something that seemed to claim for her a right as a perfect work of nature to exist and be admired equally with a rare flower or some beauti ful milk white dove among its sober hued companions she was dressed in a white waist and dark skirt that discreet masquerade of goose girl and duchess vivienne said hartley looking at her pleadingly you did not answer my last letter it was only by nearly a week s search that i found where you had moved to why have you kept me in suspense when you knew how anxiously i was waiting to see you and hear from you the girl looked out the window dreamily mr hartley she said hesitatingly i hardly know what to say to you i realize all the advantages of your offer and sometimes i feel sure that i could be contented with you but again i am doubtful i was born a city girl and i am afraid to bind myself to a quiet sub urban life my dear girl said hartley ardently have i not told you that you shall have everything that your heart can desire that is in my power to give you you shall come to the city for the theatres for shopping and to visit your friends as often as you care to you can trust me can you not to the fullest she said turning her frank eyes upon him with a smile i know you are the kindest of men and that the girl you get will be a lucky one i learned all about you when i was at the montgomerys ah exclaimed hartley with a tender reminiscent light in his eye i remember well the evening i first saw you at the montgomerys mrs montgomery was sound ing your praises to me all the evening and she hardly did you justice i shall never forget that supper come vivienne promise me i want you you ll never regret coming with me no one else will ever give you as pleasant a home the girl sighed and looked down at her folded hands a sudden jealous suspicion seized hartley tell me vivienne he asked regarding her keenly is there another is there some one else a rosy flush crept slowly over her fair cheeks and neck you shouldn t ask that mr hartley she said in some confusion but i will tell you there is one other but he has no right i have promised him nothing his name demanded hartley sternly townsend rafford townsend exclaimed hartley with a grim tightening of his jaw how did that man come to know you after all i ve done for him his auto has just stopped below said vivienne bending over the window sill he s coming for his answer oh i don t know what to do the bell in the flat kitchen whirred vivienne hurried to press the latch button stay here said hartley i will meet him in the hall townsend looking like a spanish grandee in his light tweeds panama hat and curling black mustache came up the stairs three at a time he stopped at sight of hartley and looked foolish go back said hartley firmly pointing downstairs with his forefinger hullo said townsend feigning surprise what s up what are you doing here old man go back repeated hartley inflexibly the law of the jungle do you want the pack to tear you in pieces the kill is mine i came here to see a plumber about the bathroom connections said townsend bravely all right said hartley you shall have that lying plaster to stick upon your traitorous soul but go back townsend went downstairs leaving a bitter word to be wafted up the draught of the staircase hartley went back to his wooing vivienne said he masterfully i have got to have you i will take no more refusals or dilly dallying when do you want me she asked now as soon as you can get ready she stood calmly before him and looked him in the eye do you think for one moment she said that i would enter your home while h loise is there hartley cringed as if from an unexpected blow he folded his arms and paced the carpet once or twice she shall go he declared grimly drops stood upon his brow why should i let that woman make my life miserable never have i seen one day of freedom from trouble since i have known her you are right vivienne h loise must be sent away before i can take you home but she shall go i have decided i will turn her from my doors when will you do this asked the girl hartley clinched his teeth and bent his brows together to night he said resolutely i will send her away to night then said vivienne my answer is yes come for me when you will she looked into his eyes with a sweet sincere light in her own hartley could scarcely believe that her sur render was true it was so swift and complete promise me he said feelingly on your word and honour on my word and honour repeated vivienne softly at the door he turned and gazed at her happily but yet as one who scarcely trusts the foundations of his joy to morrow he said with a forefinger of reminder uplifted to morrow she repeated with a smile of truth and candour in an hour and forty minutes hartley stepped off the train at floralhurst a brisk walk of ten minutes brought him to the gate of a handsome two story cottage set upon a wide and well tended lawn halfway to the house he was met by a woman with jet black braided hair and flowing white summer gown who half strangled him without apparent cause when they stepped into the hall she said mamma s here the auto is coming for her in half an hour she came to dinner but there s no dinner i ve something to tell you said hartley i thought to break it to you gently but since your mother is here we may as well out with it he stooped and whispered something at her ear his wife screamed her mother came running into the hall the dark haired woman screamed again the joyful scream of a well beloved and petted woman oh mamma she cried ecstatically what do you think vivienne is coming to cook for us she is the one that stayed with the montgomerys a whole year and now billy dear she concluded you must go right down into the kitchen and discharge h loise she has been drunk again the whole day long sociology in serge and straw the season of irresponsibility is at hand come let us twine round our brows wreaths of poison ivy that is for idiocy and wander hand in hand with sociology in the summer fields likely as not the world is flat the wise men have tried to prove that it is round with indifferent success they pointed out to us a ship going to sea and bade us observe that at length the convexity of the earth hid from our view all but the vessel s topmast but we picked up a telescope and looked and saw the decks and hull again then the wise men said oh pshaw anyhow the variation of the intersection of the equator and the ecliptic proves it we could not see this through our telescope so we remained silent but it stands to reason that if the world were round the queues of china men would stand straight up from their heads instead of hanging down their backs as travellers assure us they do another hot weather corroboration of the flat theory is the fact that all of life as we know it moves in little unavailing circles more justly than to anything else it can be likened to the game of baseball crack we hit the ball and away we go if we earn a run in life we call it success we get back to the home plate and sit upon a bench if we are thrown out we walk back to the home plate and sit upon a bench the circumnavigators of the alleged globe may have sailed the rim of a watery circle back to the same port again the truly great return at the high tide of their attainments to the simplicity of a child the billionaire sits down at his mahogany to his bowl of bread and milk when you reach the end of your career just take down the sign goal and look at the other side of it you will find beginning point there it has been reversed while you were going around the track but this is humour and must be stopped let us get back to the serious questions that arise whenever sociology turns summer boarder you are invited to consider the scene of the story wild atlantic waves thundering against a wooded and rock bound shore in the greater city of new york the town of fishampton on the south shore of long island is noted for its clam fritters and the summer residence of the van plushvelts the van plushvelts have a hundred million dollars and their name is a household word with tradesmen and photographers on the fifteenth of june the van plushvelts boarded up the front door of their city house carefully deposited their cat on the sidewalk instructed the caretaker not to allow it to eat any of the ivy on the walls and whizzed away in a horse power to fishampton to stray alone the shade amaryllis not being in their class if a subscriber to the toadies magazine you have often you say you are not well you buy it at a news stand thinking that the newsdealer is not wise to you but he knows about it all he knows he knows i say that you have often seen in the toadies magazine pictures of the van plushvelts summer home so it will not be described here our business is with young haywood van plushvelt sixteen years old heir to the century of millions darling of the financial gods and great grandson of peter van plushvelt former owner of a particularly fine cabbage patch that has been ruined by an intrusive lot of downtown skyscrapers one afternoon young haywood van plushvelt strolled out between the granite gate posts of dolce far niente that s what they called the place and it was an improve ment on dolce far rockaway i can tell you haywood walked down into the village he was human after all and his prospective millions weighed upon him wealth had wreaked upon him its direfullest he was the product of private tutors even under his first hobby horse had tan bark been strewn he had been born with a gold spoon lobster fork and fish set in his mouth for which i hope later to submit justification i must ask your consideration of his haberdashery and tailoring young fortunatus was dressed in a neat suit of dark blue serge a neat white straw hat neat low cut tan shoes of the well known immaculate trade mark a neat narrow four in hand tie and carried a slender neat bamboo cane down persimmon street there s never tree north of hagerstown md came from the village smoky dodson fifteen and a half worst boy in fishampton smoky was dressed in a ragged red sweater wrecked and weather worn golf cap run over shoes and trousers of the serviceable brand dust clinging to the mois ture induced by free exercise darkened wide areas of his face smoky carried a baseball bat and a league ball that advertised itself in the rotundity of his trousers pocket haywood stopped and passed the time of day going to play ball he asked smoky s eyes and countenance confronted him with a frank blue and freckled scrutiny me he said with deadly mildness sure not can t you see i ve got a divin suit on i m goin up in a submarine balloon to catch butterflies with a two inch auger excuse me said haywood with the insulting polite ness of his caste for mistaking you for a gentleman i might have known better how might you have known better if you thought i was one said smoky unconsciously a logician by your appearances said haywood no gentle man is dirty ragged and a liar smoky hooted once like a ferry boat spat on his hand got a firm grip on his baseball bat and then dropped it against the fence say said he i knows you you re the pup that belongs in that swell private summer sanitarium for city guys over there i seen you come out of the gate you can t bluff nobody because you re rich and because you got on swell clothes arabella yah ragamuffin said hay wood smoky picked up a fence rail splinter and laid it on his shoulder dare you to knock it off he challenged i wouldn t soil my hands with you said the aristocrat fraid said smoky concisely youse city ducks ain t got the i sand i kin lick you with one hand i don t wish to have any trouble with you said haywood i asked you a civil question and you replied like a like a a cad wot s a cad asked smoky a cad is a disagreeable person answered haywood who lacks manners and doesn t know his place they sometimes play baseball i can tell you what a mollycoddle is said smoky it s a monkey dressed up by its mother and sent out too pick daisies on the lawn when you have the honour to refer to the members of my family said haywood with some dim ideas of a code in his mind you d better leave the ladies out of your remarks ho ladies mocked the rude one i say ladies i know what them rich women in the city does they drink cocktails and swear and give parties to gorillas the papers says so then haywood knew that it must be he took off his coat folded it neatly and laid it on the roadside grass placed his hat upon it and began to unknot his blue silk tie hadn t yer better ring fer yer maid arabella taunted smoky wot yer going to do go to bed i m going to give you a good trouncing said the hero he did not hesitate although the enemy was far beneath him socially he remembered that his father once thrashed a cabman and the papers gave it two col umns first page and the toadies magazine had a special article on upper cuts by the upper classes and ran new pictures of the van plushvelt country seat at fishampton wot s trouncing asked smoky suspiciously i don t want your old clothes i m no oh you mean to scrap my my i won t do a thing to mamma s pet criminy i d hate to be a hand laundered thing like you smoky waited with some awkwardness for his adversary to prepare for battle his own decks were always clear for action when he should spit upon the palm of his terrible right it was equivalent to you may fire now gridley the hated patrician advanced with his shirt sleeves neatly rolled up smoky waited in an attitude of ease expecting the affair to be conducted according to fishampton s rules of war these allowed combat to be prefaced by stigma recrimination epithet abuse and insult gradually increasing in emphasis and degree after a round of these you re anothers would come the chip knocked from the shoulder or the advance across the dare line drawn with a toe on the ground next light taps given and taken these also increasing in force until finally the blood was up and fists going at their best but haywood did not know fishampton s rules noblesse oblige kept a faint smile on his face as he walked slowly up to smoky and said going to play ball smoky quickly understood this to be a putting of the previous question giving him the chance to make practical apology by answering it with civility and relevance listen this time said he i m goin skatin on the river don t you see me automobile with chinese lanterns on it standin and waitin for me haywood knocked him down smoky felt wronged to thus deprive him of preliminary wrangle and objurgation was to send an armoured knight full tilt against a crashing lance without permitting him first to caracole around the list to the flourish of trumpets but he scrambled up and fell upon his foe head feet and fists the fight lasted one round of an hour and ten minutes it was lengthened until it was more like a war or a family feud than a fight haywood had learned some of the science of boxing and wrestling from his tutors but these he discarded for the more instinctive methods of battle handed down by the cave dwelling van plushvelts so when he found himself during the m l e seated upon the kicking and roaring smoky s chest he improved the opportunity by vigorously kneading hand fuls of sand and soil into his adversary s ears eyes and mouth and when smoky got the proper leg hold and turned him he fastened both hands in the plushvelt hair and pounded the plushvelt head against the lap of mother earth of course the strife was not incessantly active there were seasons when one sat upon the other holding him down while each blew like a grampus spat out the more inconveniently large sections of gravel and and strove to subdue the spirit of his opponent with a frightful and soul paralyzing glare at last it seemed that in the language of the ring their efforts lacked steam they broke away and each disappeared in a cloud as he brushed away the dust of the conflict as soon as his breath permitted haywood walked close to smoky and said going to play ball smoky looked pensively at the sky at his bat lying on the ground and at the leaguer rounding his pocket sure he said offhandedly the yellowjackets plays the long islands i m cap n of the long islands i guess i didn t mean to say you were ragged said haywood but you are dirty you know sure said smoky yer get that way knockin around say i don t believe them new york papers about ladies drinkin and havin monkeys dinin at the table with em i guess they re lies like they print about people eatin out of silver plates and ownin dogs that cost certainly said haywood what do you play on your team ketcher ever play any never in my life said haywood i ve never known any fellows except one or two of my cousins jer like to learn we re goin to have a practice game before the match wanter come along i ll put yer in left field and yer won t be long ketchin on i d like it bully said haywood i ve alway wanted to play baseball the ladies maids of new york and the families of western mine owners with social ambitions will remember well the sensation that was created by the report that the young multi millionaire haywood van plushvelt was playing ball with the village youths of fishampton it was conceded that the millennium of democracy had come reporters and photographers swarmed to the island the papers printed half page pictures of him as short stop stopping a hot grounder the toadies magazine got out a bat and ball number that covered the subject historically beginning with the vampire bat and ending with the patriarchs ball illustrated with interior views of the van plushvelt country seat ministers educators and sociologists everywhere hailed the event as the tocsin call that proclaimed the universal brotherhood of man one afternoon i was reclining under the trees near the shore at fishampton in the esteemed company of an eminent bald headed young sociologist by way of note it may be inserted that all sociologists are more or less bald and exactly thirty two look em over the sociologist was citing the van plushvelt case as the most important uplift symptom of a generation and as an excuse for his own existence immediately before us were the village baseball grounds and now came the sportive youth of fishampton and distributed themselves shouting about the diamond there said the sociologist pointing there is young van plushvelt i raised myself so far a cosycophant with mary ann and gazed young van plushvelt sat upon the ground he was dressed in a ragged red sweater wrecked and weather worn golf cap run over shoes and trousers of the ser viceable brand dust clinging to the moisture induced by free exercise darkened wide areas of his face that is he repeated the sociologist if he had said him i could have been less vindictive on a bench with an air sat the young millionaire s chum he was dressed in a neat suit of dark blue serge a neat white straw hat neat low cut tan shoes linen of the well known immaculate trade mark a neat narrow four in hand tie and carried a slender neat bamboo cane i laughed loudly and vulgarly what you want to do said i to the sociologist is to establish a reformatory for the logical vicious circle or else i ve got wheels it looks to me as if things are running round and round in circles instead of getting anywhere what do you mean asked the man of progress why look what he has done to smoky i replied you will always be a fool said my friend the sociologist getting up and walking away the ransom of red chief it looked like a good thing but wait till i tell you we were down south in alabama bill driscoll and myself when this kidnapping idea struck us it was as bill afterward expressed it during a moment of temporary mental apparition but we didn t find that out till later there was a town down there as flat as a flannel cake and called summit of course it contained inhabitants of as undeleterious and self satisfied a class of peasantry as ever clustered around a maypole bill and me had a joint capital of about six hundred dollars and we needed just two thousand dollars more to pull off a fraudulent town lot scheme in western illinois with we talked it over on the front steps of the hotel philoprogenitiveness says we is strong in semi rural communities therefore and for other reasons a kidnapping project ought to do better there than in the radius of newspapers that send reporters out in plain clothes to stir up talk about such things we knew that summit couldn t get after us with anything stronger than constables and maybe some lackadaisical blood hounds and a diatribe or two in the weekly farmers budget so it looked good we selected for our victim the only child of a prominent citizen named ebenezer dorset the father was respect able and tight a mortgage fancier and a stern upright collection plate passer and forecloser the kid was a boy of ten with bas relief freckles and hair the colour of the cover of the magazine you buy at the news stand when you want to catch a train bill and me figured that ebenezer would melt down for a ransom of two thousand dollars to a cent but wait till i tell you about two miles from summit was a little mountain covered with a dense cedar brake on the rear elevation of this mountain was a cave there we stored provisions one evening after sundown we drove in a buggy past old dorset s house the kid was in the street throw ing rocks at a kitten on the opposite fence hey little boy says bill would you like to have a bag of candy and a nice ride the boy catches bill neatly in the eye with a piece of brick that will cost the old man an extra five hundred dollars says bill climbing over the wheel that boy put up a fight like a welter weight cinnamon bear but at last we got him down in the bottom of the buggy and drove away we took him up to the cave and i hitched the horse in the cedar brake after dark i drove the buggy to the little village three miles away where we had hired it and walked back to the moun tain bill was pasting court plaster over the scratches and bruises on his features there was a burning behind the big rock at the entrance of the cave and the boy was watching a pot of boiling coffee with two buzzard tail feathers stuck in his red hair he points a stick at me when i come up and says ha cursed paleface do you dare to enter the camp of red chief the terror of the plains he s all right now says bill rolling up his trousers and examining some bruises on his shins we re playing indian we re making buffalo bill s show look like magic lantern views of palestine in the town hall i m old hank the trapper red chief s captive and i m to be scalped at daybreak by geronimo that kid can kick hard yes sir that boy seemed to be having the time of his life the fun of camping out in a cave had made him forget that he was a captive himself he immediately christened me snake eye the spy and announced that when his braves returned from the warpath i was to be broiled at the stake at the rising of the sun then we had supper and he filled his mouth full of bacon and bread and gravy and began to talk he made a during dinner speech something like this i like this fine i never camped out before but i had a pet possum once and i was nine last birthday i hate to go to school rats ate up sixteen of jimmy talbot s aunt s speckled hen s eggs are there any real indians in these woods i want some more gravy does the trees moving make the wind blow we had five puppies what makes your nose so red hank my father has lots of money are the stars hot i whipped ed walker twice saturday i don t like girls you dassent catch toads unless with a string do oxen make any noise why are oranges round have you got beds to sleep on in this cave amos murray has got six toes a parrot can talk but a monkey or a fish can t how many does it take to make twelve every few minutes he would remember that he was a pesky redskin and pick up his stick rifle and tiptoe to the mouth of the cave to rubber for the scouts of the hated paleface now and then he would let out a war whoop that made old hank the trapper shiver that boy had bill terrorized from the start red chief says i to the kid would you like to go home aw what for says he i don t have any fun at home i hate to go to school i like to camp out you won t take me back home again snake eye will you not right away says i we ll stay here in the cave a while all right says he that ll be fine i never had such fun in all my life we went to bed about eleven o clock we spread down some wide blankets and quilts and put red chief between us we weren t afraid he d run away he kept us awake for three hours jumping up and reaching for his rifle and screeching hist pard in mine and bill s ears as the fancied crackle of a twig or the rustle of a leaf revealed to his young imagination the stealthy approach of the outlaw band at last i fell into a troubled sleep and dreamed that i had been kidnapped and chained to a tree by a ferocious pirate with red hair just at daybreak i was awakened by a series of awful screams from bill they weren t yells or howls or shouts or whoops or yalps such as you d expect from a manly set of vocal organs they were simply indecent terrifying humiliating screams such as women emit when they see ghosts or caterpillars it s an awful thing to hear a strong desperate fat man scream incontinently in a cave at daybreak i jumped up to see what the matter was red chief was sitting on bill s chest with one hand twined in bill s hair in the other he had the sharp case knife we used for slicing bacon and he was industriously and realistically trying to take bill s scalp according to the sentence that had been pronounced upon him the evening before i got the knife away from the kid and made him lie down again but from that moment bill s spirit was broken he laid down on his side of the bed but he never closed an eye again in sleep as long as that boy was with us i dozed off for a while but along toward sun up i remem bered that red chief had said i was to be burned at the stake at the rising of the sun i wasn t nervous or afraid but i sat up and lit my pipe and leaned against a rock what you getting up so soon for sam asked bill me says i oh i got a kind of a pain in my shoulder i thought sitting up would rest it you re a liar says bill you re afraid you was to be burned at sunrise and you was afraid he d do it and he would too if he could find a match ain t it awful sam do you think anybody will pay out money to get a little imp like that back home sure said i a rowdy kid like that is just the kind that parents dote on now you and the chief get up and cook breakfast while i go up on the top of this mountain and reconnoitre i went up on the peak of the little mountain and ran my eye over the contiguous vicinity over toward summit i expected to see the sturdy yeomanry of the village armed with scythes and pitchforks beating the countryside for the dastardly kidnappers but what i saw was a peaceful landscape dotted with one man ploughing with a dun mule nobody was dragging the creek no couriers dashed hither and yon bringing tidings of no news to the distracted parents there was a sylvan attitude of somnolent sleepiness pervading that section of the external outward surface of alabama that lay exposed to my view perhaps says i to myself it has not yet been discov ered that the wolves have home away the tender lambkin from the fold heaven help the wolves says i and i went down the mountain to breakfast when i got to the cave i found bill backed up against the side of it breathing hard and the boy threatening to smash him with a rock half as big as a cocoanut he put a red hot boiled potato down my back explained bill and the mashed it with his foot and i boxed his ears have you got a gun about you sam i took the rock away from the boy and kind of patched up the argument i ll fix you says the kid to bill no man ever yet struck the red chief but what he got paid for it you better beware after breakfast the kid takes a piece of leather with strings wrapped around it out of his pocket and goes out side the cave unwinding it what s he up to now says bill anxiously you don t think he ll run away do you sam no fear of it says i he don t seem to be much of a home body but we ve got to fix up some plan about the ransom there don t seem to be much excitement around summit on account of his disappearance but maybe they haven t realized yet that he s gone his folks may think he s spending the night with aunt jane or one of the neighbours anyhow he ll be missed to day to night we must get a message to his father demanding the two thousand dollars for his return just then we heard a kind of war whoop such as david might have emitted when he knocked out the champion goliath it was a sling that red chief had pulled out of his pocket and he was whirling it around his head i dodged and heard a heavy thud and a kind of a sigh from bill like a horse gives out when you take his saddle off a niggerhead rock the size of an egg had caught bill just behind his left ear he loosened himself all over and fell in the fire across the frying pan of hot water for washing the dishes i dragged him out and poured cold water on his head for half an hour by and by bill sits up and feels behind his ear and says sam do you know who my favourite biblical character is take it easy says i you ll come to your senses presently king herod says he you won t go away and leave me here alone will you sam i went out and caught that boy and shook him until his freckles rattled if you don t behave says i i ll take you straight home now are you going to be good or not i was only funning says he sullenly i didn t mean to hurt old hank but what did he hit me for i ll behave snake eye if you won t send me home and if you ll let me play the black scout to day i don t know the game says i that s for you and mr bill to decide he s your playmate for the day i m going away for a while on business now you come in and make friends with him and say you are sorry for hurting him or home you go at once i made him and bill shake hands and then i took bill aside and told him i was going to poplar cove a little village three miles from the cave and find out what i could about how the kidnapping had been regarded in summit also i thought it best to send a peremptory letter to old man dorset that day demanding the ransom and dictating how it should be paid you know sam says bill i ve stood by you with out batting an eye in earthquakes fire and flood in poker games dynamite outrages police raids train robberies and cyclones i never lost my nerve yet till we kidnapped that two legged skyrocket of a kid he s got me going you won t leave me long with him will you sam i ll be back some time this afternoon says i you must keep the boy amused and quiet till i return and now we ll write the letter to old dorset bill and i got paper and pencil and worked on the letter while red chief with a blanket wrapped around him strutted up and down guarding the mouth of the cave bill begged me tearfully to make the ransom fifteen hundred dollars instead of two thousand i ain t attempting says he to decry the celebrated moral aspect of parental affection but we re dealing with humans and it ain t human for anybody to give up two thousand dollars for that forty pound chunk of freckled wildcat i m willing to take a chance at fifteen hundred dollars you can charge the difference up to me so to relieve bill i acceded and we collaborated a letter that ran this way ebenezer dorset esq we have your boy concealed in a place far from summit it is useless for you or the most skilful detectives to attempt to find him absolutely the only terms on which you can have him restored to you are these we demand fifteen hundred dollars in large bills for his return the money to be left at midnight to night at the same spot and in the same box as your reply as hereinafter described if you agree to these terms send your answer in writing by a solitary messenger to night at half past eight o clock after crossing owl creek on the road to poplar cove there are three large trees about a hundred yards apart close to the fence of the wheat field on the right hand side at the bottom of the fence post opposite the third tree will be found a small pasteboard box the messenger will place the answer in this box and return immediately to summit if you attempt any treachery or fail to comply with our demand as stated you will never see your boy again if you pay the money as demanded he will be returned to you safe and well within three hours these terms are final and if you do not accede to them no further coin munication will be attempted two desperate men i addressed this letter to dorset and put it in my pocket as i was about to start the kid comes up to me and says aw snake eye you said i could play the black scout while you was gone play it of course says i mr bill will play with you what kind of a game is it i m the black scout says red chief and i have to ride to the stockade to warn the settlers that the indians are coming i m tired of playing indian myself i want to be the black scout all right says i it sounds harmless to me i guess mr bill will help you foil the pesky savages what am i to do asks bill looking at the kid suspiciously you are the hoss says black scout get down on your hands and knees how can i ride to the stockade without a hoss you d better keep him interested said i till we get the scheme going loosen up bill gets down on his all fours and a look comes in his eye like a rabbit s when you catch it in a trap how far is it to the stockade kid he asks in a husky manner of voice ninety miles says the black scout and you have to hump yourself to get there on time whoa now the black scout jumps on bill s back and digs his heels in his side for heaven s sake says bill hurry back sam as soon as you can i wish we hadn t made the ransom more than a thousand say you quit kicking me or i ll get up and warm you good i walked over to poplar cove and sat around the post office and store talking with the chawbacons that came in to trade one whiskerando says that he hears summit is all upset on account of elder ebenezer dorset s boy having been lost or stolen that was all i wanted to know i bought some smoking tobacco referred casually to the price of black eyed peas posted my letter surreptitiously and came away the postmaster said the mail carrier would come by in an hour to take the mail on to summit when i got back to the cave bill and the boy were not to be found i explored the vicinity of the cave and risked a yodel or two but there was no response so i lighted my pipe and sat down on a mossy bank to await developments in about half an hour i heard the bushes rustle and bill wabbled out into the little glade in front of the cave behind him was the kid stepping softly like a scout with a broad grin on his face bill stopped took off his hat and wiped his face with a red handkerchief the kid stopped about eight feet behind him sam says bill i suppose you ll think i m a rene gade but i couldn t help it i m a grown person with masculine proclivities and habits of self defense but there is a time when all systems of egotism and predominance fail the boy is gone i have sent him home all is off there was martyrs in old times goes on bill that suffered death rather than give up the particular graft they enjoyed none of em ever was subjugated to such supernatural tortures as i have been i tried to be faithful to our articles of depredation but there came a limit what s the trouble bill i asks him i was rode says bill the ninety miles to the stockade not barring an inch then when the settlers was rescued i was given oats sand ain t a palatable substitute and then for an hour i had to try to explain to him why there was nothin in holes how a road can run both ways and what makes the grass green i tell you sam a human can only stand so much i takes him by the neck of his clothes and drags him down the mountain on the way he kicks my legs black and blue from the knees down and i ve got to have two or three bites on my thumb and hand cauterized but he s gone continues bill gone home i showed him the road to summit and kicked him about eight feet nearer there at one kick i m sorry we lose the ransom but it was either that or bill driscoll to the madhouse bill is puffing and blowing but there is a look of ineffable peace and growing content on his rose pink features bill says i there isn t any heart disease in your family is there no says bill nothing chronic except malaria and accidents why then you might turn around says i and have a took behind you bill turns and sees the boy and loses his complexion and sits down plump on the round and begins to pluck aimlessly at grass and little sticks for an hour i was afraid for his mind and then i told him that my scheme was to put the whole job through immediately and that we would get the ransom and be off with it by midnight if old dorset fell in with our proposition so bill braced up enough to give the kid a weak sort of a smile and a promise to play the russian in a japanese war with him is soon as he felt a little better i had a scheme for collecting that ransom without danger of being caught by counterplots that ought to commend itself to professional kidnappers the tree under which the answer was to be left and the money later on was close to the road fence with big bare fields on all sides if a gang of constables should be watching for any one to come for the note they could see him a long way off crossing the fields or in the road but no sirree at half past eight i was up in that tree as well hidden as a tree toad waiting for the messenger to arrive exactly on time a half grown boy rides up the road on a bicycle locates the pasteboard box at the foot of the fence post slips a folded piece of paper into it and pedals away again back toward summit i waited an hour and then concluded the thing was square i slid down the tree got the note slipped along the fence till i struck the woods and was back at the cave in another half an hour i opened the note got near the lantern and read it to bill it was written with a pen in a crabbed hand and the sum and substance of it was this two desperate men gentlemen i received your letter to day by post in regard to the ransom you ask for the return of my son i think you are a little high in your demands and i hereby make you a counter proposition which i am inclined to believe you will accept you bring johnny home and pay me two hundred and fifty dollars in cash and i agree to take him off your hands you had better come at night for the neighbours believe he is lost and i couldn t be responsible for what they would do to anybody they saw bringing him back very respectfully ebenezer dorset great pirates of penzance says i of all the impudent but i glanced at bill and hesitated he had the most appealing look in his eyes i ever saw on the face of a dumb or a talking brute sam says he what s two hundred and fifty dollars after all we ve got the money one more night of this kid will send me to a bed in bedlam besides being a thorough gentleman i think mr dorset is a spend thrift for making us such a liberal offer you ain t going to let the chance go are you tell you the truth bill says i this little he ewe lamb has somewhat got on my nerves too we ll take him home pay the ransom and make our get away we took him home that night we got him to go by telling him that his father had bought a silver mounted rifle and a pair of moccasins for him and we were going to hunt bears the next day it was just twelve o clock when we knocked at ebene zer s front door just at the moment when i should have been abstracting the fifteen hundred dollars from the box under the tree according to the original proposition bill was counting out two hundred and fifty dollars into dorset s hand when the kid found out we were going to leave him at home he started up a howl like a calliope and fastened himself as tight as a leech to bill s leg his father peeled him away gradually like a porous plaster how long can you hold him asks bill i m not as strong as i used to be says old dorset but i think i can promise you ten minutes enough says bill in ten minutes i shall cross the central southern and middle western states and be legging it trippingly for the canadian border and as dark as it was and as fat as bill was and as good a runner as i am he was a good mile and a half out of summit before i could

how goes it old girl this may who is no goddess but circe masquerading at the dance given in honour of the fair d butante sum mer puts the kibosh on us all old mr coulson groaned a little and then sat up straight in his invalid s chair he had the gout very bad in one foot a house near gramercy park half a million dollars and a daughter and he had a house keeper mrs widdup the fact and the name deserve a sentence each they have it when may poked mr coulson he became elder brother to the turtle dove in the window near which he sat were boxes of jonquils of hyacinths geraniums and pansies the breeze brought their odour into the room immediately there was a well contested round between the breath of the flowers and the able and active effluvium from gout liniment the liniment won easily but not before the flowers got an uppercut to old mr coulson s nose the deadly work of the implacable false enchant ress may was done across the park to the olfactories of mr coulson came other unmistakable characteristic copyrighted smells of spring that belong to the big city above the subway alone the smells of hot asphalt underground caverns gasoline patchouli orange peel sewer gas albany grabs egyptian cigarettes mortar and the undried ink on news papers the inblowing air was sweet and mild sparrows wrangled happily everywhere outdoors never trust may mr coulson twisted the ends of his white mustache cursed his foot and pounded a bell on the table by his side in came mrs widdup she was comely to the eye fair flustered forty and foxy higgins is out sir she said with a smile suggestive of vibratory massage he went to post a letter can i do anything for you sir it s time for my aconite said old mr coulson drop it for me the bottle s there three drops in water d that is confound higgins there s nobody in this house cares if i die here in this chair for want of attention mrs widdup sighed deeply don t be saying that sir she said there s them that would care more than any one knows thirteen drops you said sir three said old man coulson he took his dose and then mrs widdup s hand she blushed oh yes it can be done just hold your breath and compress the diaphragm mrs widdup said mr coulson the springtime s full upon us ain t that right said mrs widdup the air s real warm and there s bock beer signs on every corner and the park s all yaller and pink and blue with flowers and i have such shooting pains up my legs and body in the spring quoted mr coulson curling his mustache a y that is a man s fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love lawsy now exclaimed mrs widdup ain t that right seems like it s in the air in the spring continued old mr coulson a livelier iris shines upon the burnished dove they do be lively the irish sighed mrs widdup pensively mrs widdup said mr coulson making a face at a twinge of his gouty foot this would be a lonesome house without you i m an that is i m an elderly man but i m worth a comfortable lot of money if half a million dollars worth of government bonds and the true affection of a heart that though no longer beating with the first ardour of youth can still throb with genuine the loud noise of an overturned chair near the porti res of the adjoining room interrupted the venerable and scarcely suspecting victim of may in stalked miss van meeker constantia coulson bony durable tall high nosed frigid well bred thirty five in the neighbourhood of gramercy parkish she put up a lorgnette mrs widdup hastily stooped and arranged the bandages on mr coulson s gouty foot i thought higgins was with you said miss van meeker constantia higgins went out explained her father and mrs widdup answered the bell that is better now mrs widdup thank you no there is nothing else i require the housekeeper retired pink under the cool inquiring stare of miss coulson this spring weather is lovely isn t it daughter said the old man consciously conscious that s just it replied miss van meeker constantia coulson somewhat obscurely when does mrs wid dup start on her vacation papa i believe she said a week from to day said mr coulson miss van meeker constantia stood for a minute at the window gazing toward the little park flooded with the mellow afternoon sunlight with the eye of a botanist she viewed the flowers most potent weapons of insid ious may with the cool pulses of a virgin of cologne she withstood the attack of the ethereal mildness the arrows of the pleasant sunshine fell back frostbitten from the cold panoply of her unthrilled bosom the odour of the flowers waked no soft sentiments in the unexplored recesses of her dormant heart the chirp of the sparrows gave her a pain she mocked at may but although miss coulson was proof against the season she was keen enough to estimate its power she knew that elderly men and thick waisted women jumped as educated fleas in the ridiculous train of may the merry mocker of the months she had heard of foolish old gentlemen marrying their housekeepers before what a humiliating thing after all was this feeling called love the next morning at o clock when the iceman called the cook told him that miss coulson wanted to see him in the basement well ain t i the olcott and depew not mentioning the first name at all said the iceman admiringly of himself as a concession he rolled his sleeves down dropped his icehooks on a syringe and went back when miss van meeker constantia coulson addressed him he took off his bat there is a rear entrance to this basement said miss coulson which can be reached by driving into the vacant lot next door where they are excavating for a building i want you to bring in that way within two hours pounds of ice you may have to bring another man or two to help you i will show you where i want it placed i also want pounds a day delivered the same way for the next four days your company may charge the ice on our regular bill this is for your extra trouble miss coulson tendered a ten dollar bill the iceman bowed and held his hat in his two hands behind him not if you ll excuse me lady it ll be a pleasure to fix things up for you any way you please alas for may about noon mr coulson knocked two glasses off his table broke the spring of his bell and yelled for higgins at the same time bring an axe commanded mr coulson sardoni cally or send out for a quart of prussic acid or have a policeman come in and shoot me i d rather that than be frozen to death it does seem to be getting cool sir said higgins i hadn t noticed it before i ll close the window sir do said mr coulson they call this spring do they if it keeps up long i ll go back to palm beach house feels like a morgue later miss coulson dutifully came in to inquire how the gout was progressing stantia said the old man how is the weather out doors bright answered miss coulson but chilly feels like the dead of winter to me said mr coulson an instance said constantia gazing abstractedly out the window of winter lingering in the lap of spring though the metaphor is not in the most refined taste a little later she walked down by the side of the little park and on westward to broadway to accomplish a little shopping a little later than that mrs widdup entered the invalid s room did you ring sir she asked dimpling in many places i asked higgins to go to the drug store and i thought i heard your bell i did not said mr coulson i m afraid said mrs widdup i interrupted you sir yesterday when you were about to say something how comes it mrs widdup said old man coulson sternly that i find it so cold in this house cold sir said the housekeeper why now since you speak of it it do seem cold in this room but out doors it s as warm and fine as june sir and how this weather do seem to make one s heart jump out of one s shirt waist sir and the ivy all leaved out on the side of the house and the hand organs playing and the children dancing on the sidewalk tis a great time for speaking out what s in the heart you were saying yesterday sir woman roared mr coulson you are a fool i pay you to take care of this house i am freezing to death in my own room and you come in and drivel to me about ivy and hand organs get me an overcoat at once see that all doors and windows are closed below an old fat irresponsible one sided object like you prat ing about springtime and flowers in the middle of winter when higgins comes back tell him to bring me a hot rum punch and now get out but who shall shame the bright face of may rogue though she be and disturber of sane men s peace no wise virgins cunning nor cold storage shall make her bow her head in the bright galaxy of months oh yes the story was not quite finished a night passed and higgins helped old man coulson in the morning to his chair by the window the cold of the room was gone heavenly odours and fragrant mild ness entered in hurried mrs widdup and stood by his chair mr coulson reached his bony hand and grasped her plump one mrs widdup he said this house would be no home without you i have half a million dollars if that and the true affection of a heart no lonoer in its youthful prime but still not cold could i found out what made it cold said mrs widdup leanin against his chair twas ice tons of it in the basement and in the furnace room everywhere i shut off the registers that it was coming through into your room mr coulson poor soul and now it s maytime again a true heart went on old man coulson a little wanderingly that the springtime has brought to life again and but what will my daughter say mrs widdup never fear sir said mrs widdup cheerfully miss coulson she ran away with the iceman last night sir a technical error i never cared especially for feuds believing them to be even more overrated products of our country than grapefruit scrapple or honeymoons nevertheless if i may be allowed i will tell you of an indian territory feud of which i was press agent camp follower and inaccessory during the fact i was on a visit to sam durkee s ranch where i had a great time falling off unmanicured ponies and waving my bare hand at the lower jaws of wolves about two miles away sam was a hardened person of about twenty five with a reputation for going home in the dark with perfect equanimity though often with reluctance over in the creek nation was a family bearing the name of tatum i was told that the durkees and tatums had been feuding for years several of each family had bitten the grass and it was expected that more nebuchad nezzars would follow a younger generation of each family was growing up and the grass was keeping pace with them but i gathered that they had fought fairly that they had not lain in cornfields and aimed at the division of their enemies suspenders in the back partly perhaps because there were no cornfields and nobody wore more than one suspender nor had any woman or child of either house ever been harmed in those days and you will find it so yet their women were safe sam durkee had a girl if it were an all fiction magazine that i expect to sell this story to i should say mr durkee rejoiced in a fianc e her name was ella baynes they appeared to be devoted to each other and to have perfect confidence in each other as all couples do who are and have or aren t and haven t she was tolerably pretty with a heavy mass of brown hair that helped her along he introduced me to her which seemed not to lessen her preference for him so i reasoned that they were surely soul mates miss baynes lived in kingfisher twenty miles from the ranch sam lived on a gallop between the two places one day there came to kingfisher a courageous young man rather small with smooth face and regular features he made many inquiries about the business of the town and especially of the inhabitants cognominally he said he was from muscogee and he looked it with his yellow shoes and crocheted four in hand i met him once when i rode in for the mail he said his name was beverly travers which seemed rather improbable there were active times on the ranch just then and sam was too busy to go to town often as an incom petent and generally worthless guest it devolved upon me to ride in for little things such as post cards barrels of flour baking powder smoking tobacco and letters from ella one day when i was messenger for half a gross of cigarette papers and a couple of wagon tires i saw the alleged beverly travers in a yellow wheeled buggy with ella baynes driving about town as ostentatiously as the black waxy mud would permit i knew that this infor mation would bring no balm of gilead to sam s soul so i refrained from including it in the news of the city that i retailed on my return but on the next afternoon an elongated ex cowboy of the name of simmons an old time pal of sam s who kept a feed store in kingfisher rode out to the ranch and rolled and burned many cigar ettes before he would talk when he did make oration his words were these say sam there s been a description of a galoot miscallin himself bevel edged travels impairing the atmospheric air of kingfisher for the past two weeks you know who he was he was not otherwise than ben tatum from the creek nation son of old gopher tatum that your uncle newt shot last february you know what he done this morning he killed your brother lester shot him in the co t house yard i wondered if sam had heard he pulled a twig from a mesquite bush chewed it gravely and said he did did he he killed lester the same said simmons and he did more he run away with your girl the same as to say miss ella baynes i thought you might like to know so i rode out to impart the information i am much obliged jim said sam taking the chewed twig from his mouth yes i m glad you rode out yes i m right glad well i ll be ridin back i reckon that boy i left in the feed store don t know hay from oats he shot lester in the back shot him in the back yes while he was hitchin his hoss i m much obliged jim i kind of thought you d like to know as soon as you could come in and have some coffee before you ride back jim why no i reckon not i must get back to the store and you say yes sam everybody seen em drive away together in a buckboard with a big bundle like clothes tied up in the back of it he was drivin the team he brought over with him from muscogee they ll be hard to over take right away and which i was goin on to tell you they left on the guthrie road but there s no tellin which forks they ll take you know that all right jim much obliged you re welcome sam simmons rolled a cigarette and stabbed his pony with both heels twenty yards away he reined up and called back you don t want no assistance as you might say not any thanks i didn t think you would well so long sam took out and opened a bone handled pocket knife and scraped a dried piece of mud from his left boot i thought at first he was going to swear a vendetta on the blade of it or recite the gipsy s curse the few feuds i had ever seen or read about usually opened that way this one seemed to be presented with a new treat ment thus offered on the stage it would have been hissed off and one of belasco s thrilling melodramas demanded instead i wonder said sam with a profoundly thoughtful expression if the cook has any cold beans left over he called wash the negro cook and finding that he had some ordered him to heat up the pot and make some strong coffee then we went into sam s private room where he slept and kept his armoury dogs and the sad dles of his favourite mounts he took three or four six shooters out of a bookcase and began to look them over whistling the cowboy s lament abstractedly after ward he ordered the two best horses on the ranch saddled and tied to the hitching post now in the feud business in all sections of the country i have observed that in one particular there is a delicate but strict etiquette belonging you must not mention the word or refer to the subject in the presence of a feudist it would be more reprehensible than commenting upon the mole on the chin of your rich aunt i found later on that there is another unwritten rule but i think that belongs solely to the west it yet lacked two hours to supper time but in twenty minutes sam and i were plunging deep into the reheated beans hot coffee and cold beef nothing like a good meal before a long ride said sam eat hearty i had a sudden suspicion why did you have two horses saddled i asked one two one two said sam you can count can t you his mathematics carried with it a momentary qualm and a lesson the thought had not occurred to him that the thought could possibly occur to me not to ride at his side on that red road to revenge and justice it was the higher calculus i was booked for the trail i began to eat more beans in an hour we set forth at a steady gallop eastward our horses were kentucky bred strengthened by the mesquite grass of the west ben tatum s steeds may have been swifter and he had a good lead but if he had heard the punctual thuds of the hoofs of those trailers of ours born in the heart of feudland he might have felt that retribution was creeping up on the hoof prints of his dapper nags i knew that ben tatum s card to play was flight flight until he came within the safer territory of his own henchmen and supporters he knew that the man pur suing him would follow the trail to any end where it might lead during the ride sam talked of the prospect for rain of the price of beef and of the musical glasses you would have thought he had never had a brother or a sweetheart or an enemy on earth there are some sub jects too big even for the words in the unabridged knowing this phase of the feud code but not having practised it sufficiently i overdid the thing by telling some slightly funny anecdotes sam laughed at exactly the right place laughed with his mouth when i caught sight of his mouth i wished i had been blessed with enough sense of humour to have suppressed those anecdotes our first sight of them we had in guthrie tired and hungry we stumbled unwashed into a little yellow pine hotel and sat at a table in the opposite corner we saw the fugitives they were bent upon their meal but looked around at times uneasily the girl was dressed in brown one of these smooth half shiny silky looking affairs with lace collar and cuffs and what i believe they call an accordion plaited skirt she wore a thick brown veil down to her nose and a broad brimmed straw hat with some kind of feathers adorning it the man wore plain dark clothes and his hair was trimmed very short he was such a man as you might see anywhere there they were the murderer and the woman he had stolen there we were the rightful avenger according to the code and the supernumerary who writes these words for one time at least in the heart of the supernumerary there rose the killing instinct for one moment he joined the force of combatants orally what are you waiting for sam i said in a whisper let him have it now sam gave a melancholy sigh you don t understand but he does he said he knows mr tenderfoot there s a rule out here among white men in the nation that you can t shoot a man when he s with a woman i never knew it to be broke yet you can t do it you ve got to get him in a gang of men or by himself that s why he knows it too we all know so that s mr ben tatum one of the pretty men i ll cut him out of the herd before they leave the hotel and regulate his account after supper the flying pair disappeared quickly although sam haunted lobby and stairway and halls half the night in some mysterious way the fugitives eluded him and in the morning the veiled lady in the brown dress with the accordion plaited skirt and the dapper young man with the close clipped hair and the buckboard with the prancing nags were gone it is a monotonous story that of the ride so it shall be curtailed once again we overtook them on a road we were about fifty yards behind they turned in the buckboard and looked at us then drove on without whipping up their horses their safety no longer lay in speed ben tatum knew he knew that the only rock of safety left to him was the code there is no doubt that had he been alone the matter would have been settled quickly with sam durkee in the usual way but he had something at his side that kept still the trigger finger of both it seemed likely that he was no coward so you may perceive that woman on occasions may postpone instead of precipitating conflict between man and man but not willingly or consciously she is oblivious of codes five miles farther we came upon the future great western city of chandler the horses of pursuers and pursued were starved and weary there was one hotel that offered danger to man and entertainment to beast so the four of us met again in the dining room at the ringing of a bell so resonant and large that it had cracked the welkin long ago the dining room was not as large as the one at guthrie just as we were eating apple pie how ben davises and tragedy impinge upon each other i noticed sam looking with keen intentness at our quarry where they were seated at a table across the room the girl still wore the brown dress with lace collar and cuffs and the veil drawn down to her nose the man bent over his plate with his close cropped head held low there s a code i heard sam say either to me or to himself that won t let you shoot a man in the company of a woman but by thunder there ain t one to keep you from killing a woman in the company of a man and quicker than my mind could follow his argument he whipped a colt s automatic from under his left arm and pumped six bullets into the body that the brown dress covered the brown dress with the lace collar and cuffs and the accordion plaited skirt the young person in the dark sack suit from whose head and from whose life a woman s glory had been clipped laid her head on her arms stretched upon the table while people came running to raise ben tatum from the floor in his feminine masquerade that had given sam the opportunity to set aside technically the obliga tions of the code suite homes and their romance few young couples in the big city of bluff began their married existence with greater promise of happiness than did mr and mrs claude turpin they felt no especial animosity toward each other they were comfort ably established in a handsome apartment house that had a name and accommodations like those of a sleeping car they were living as expensively as the couple on the next floor above who had twice their income and their marriage had occurred on a wager a ferry boat and first acquaintance thus securing a sensational newspaper notice with their names attached to pictures of the queen of roumania and m santos dumont turpin s income was per month on pay day after calculating the amounts due for rent instalments on furniture and piano gas and bills owed to the florist confectioner milliner tailor wine merchant and cab company the turpins would find that they still had left to spend how to do this is one of the secrets of metropolitan life the domestic life of the turpins was a beautiful picture to see but you couldn t gaze upon it as you could at an oleograph of don t wake grandma or brook lyn by moonlight you had to blink when looked at it and you heard a fizzing sound just like the machine with a scope at the end of it yes there wasn t much repose about the picture of the turpins domestic life it was something like spearing salmon in the columbia river or jap anese artillery in action every day was just like another as the days are in new york in the morning turpin would take bromo seltzer his pocket change from under the clock his hat no breakfast and his departure for the office at noon mrs turpin would get out of bed and humour put on a kimono airs and the water to boil for coffee turpin lunched downtown he came home at to dress for dinner they always dined out they strayed from the chop house to chop sueydom from terrace to table d h te from rathskeller to roadhouse from caf to casino from maria s to the martha wash ington such is domestic life in the great city your vine is the mistletoe your fig tree bears dates your household gods are mercury and john howard payne for the wedding march you now hear only come with the gypsy bride you rarely dine at the same place twice in succession you tire of the food and besides you want to give them time for the question of that souve nir silver sugar bowl to blow over the turpins were therefore happy they made many warm and delightful friends some of whom they remem bered the next day their home life was an ideal one according to the rules and regulations of the book of bluff there came a time when it dawned upon turpin that his wife was getting away with too much money if you belong to the near swell class in the big city and your income is per month and you find at the end of the month after looking over the bills for current expenses that you yourself have spent you very naturally wonder what has become of the other so you suspect your wife and perhaps you give her a hint that something needs explanation i say vivien said turpin one afternoon when they were enjoying in rapt silence the peace and quiet of their cozy apartment you ve been creating a hiatus big enough for a dog to crawl through in this month s hon orarium you haven t been paying your dressmaker anything on account have you there was a moment s silence no sounds could be heard except the breathing of the fox terrier and the subdued monotonous sizzling of vivien s fulvous locks against the insensate curling irons claude turpin sitting upon a pillow that he had thoughtfully placed upon the convolutions of the apartment sofa narrowly watched the riante lovely face of his wife claudie dear said she touching her finger to her ruby tongue and testing the unresponsive curling irons you do me an injustice mme toinette has not seen a cent of mine since the day you paid your tailor ten dollars on account turpin s suspicions were allayed for the time but one day soon there came an anonymous letter to him that read watch your wife she is blowing in your money secretly i was a sufferer just as you are the place is no blank street a word to the wise etc a man who knows turpin took this letter to the captain of police of the precinct that he lived in my precinct is as clean as a hound s tooth said the captain the lid s shut down as close there as it is over the eye of a williamsburg girl when she s kissed at a party but if you think there s anything queer at the address i ll go there with ye on the next afternoon at turpin and the captain crept softly up the stairs of no blank street a dozen plain clothes men dressed in full police uniforms so as to allay suspicion waited in the hall below at the top of the stairs was a door which was found to be locked the captain took a key from his pocket and unlocked it the two men entered they found themselves in a large room occupied by twenty or twenty five elegantly clothed ladies racing charts hung against the walls a ticker clicked in one corner with a telephone receiver to his ear a man was calling out the various positions of the horses in a very exciting race the occupants of the room looked up at the intruders but as if reassured by the sight of the captain s uniform they reverted their attention to the man at the telephone you see said the captain to turpin the value of an anonymous letter no high minded and self respect ing gentleman should consider one worthy of notice is your wife among this assembly mr turpin she is not said turpin and if she was continued the captain would she be within the reach of the tongue of slander these ladies constitute a browning society they meet to discuss the meaning of the great poet the telephone is connected with boston whence the parent society transmits frequently its interpretations of the poems be ashamed of yer suspicions mr turpin go soak your shield said turpin vivien knows how to take care of herself in a pool room she s not dropping anything on the ponies there must be some thing queer going on here nothing but browning said the captain hear that thanatopsis by a nose drawled the man at the telephone that s not browning that s longfellow said turpin who sometimes read books back to the pasture exclaimed the captain long fellow made the pacing to wagon record of way back in i believe there s something queer about this joint repeated turpin i don t see it said the captain i know it looks like a pool room all right persisted turpin but that s all a blind vivien has been dropping a lot of coin somewhere i believe there s some under handed work going on here a number of racing sheets were tacked close together covering a large space on one of the walls turpin suspicious tore several of them down a door pre viously hidden was revealed turpin placed an ear to the crack and listened intently he heard the soft hum of many voices low and guarded laughter and a sharp metallic clicking and scraping as if from a multitude of tiny but busy objects my god it is as i feared whispered turpin to himself summon your men at once he called to the captain she is in there i know at the blowing of the captain s whistle the uniformed plain clothes men rushed up the stairs into the pool room when they saw the betting paraphernalia distrib uted around they halted surprised and puzzled to know why they had been summoned but the captain pointed to the lock ed door and bade them break it down in a few moments they demolished it with the axes they carried into the other room sprang claude turpin with the captain at his heels the scene was one that lingered long in turpin s mind nearly a score of women women expensively and fashionably clothed many beautiful and of refined appearance had been seated at little marble topped tables when the police burst open the door they shrieked and ran here and there like gayly plumed birds that had been disturbed in a tropical grove some became hysterical one or two fainted several knelt at the feet of the officers and besought them for mercy on account of their families and social position a man who had been seated behind a desk had seized a roll of currency as large as the ankle of a paradise roof gardens chorus girl and jumped out of the window half a dozen attendants huddled at one end of the room breathless from fear upon the tables remained the damning and incon trovertible evidences of the guilt of the habitu es of that sinister room dish after dish heaped high with ice cream and surrounded by stacks of empty ones scraped to the last spoonful ladies said the captain to his weeping circle of prisoner i ll not hold any of yez some of yez i recog nize as having fine houses and good standing in the community with hard working husbands and childer at home but i ll read ye a bit of a lecture before ye go in the next room there s a to shot just dropped in under the wire three lengths ahead of the field is this the way ye waste your husbands money instead of help ing earn it home wid yez the lid s on the ice cream freezer in this precinct claude turpin s wife was among the patrons of the raided room he led her to their apartment in stem silence there she wept so remorsefully and besought his forgiveness so pleadingly that he forgot his just anger and soon he gathered his penitent golden haired vivien in his arms and forgave her darling she murmured half sobbingly as the moon light drifted through the open window glorifying her sweet upturned face i know i done wrong i will never touch ice cream again i forgot you were not a millionaire i used to go there every day but to day i felt some strange sad presentiment of evil and i was not myself i ate only eleven saucers say no more said claude gently as he fondly caressed her waving curls and you are sure that you fully forgive me asked vivien gazing at him entreatingly with dewy eyes of heavenly blue almost sure little one answered claude stooping and lightly touching her snowy forehead with his lips i ll let you know later on i ve got a month s salary down on vanilla to win the three year old steeplechase to morrow and if the ice cream hunch is to the good you are it again see the whirligig of life justice of the peace benaja widdup sat in the door of his office smoking his elder stem pipe half way to the zenith the cumberland range rose blue gray in the afternoon haze a speckled hen swaggered down the main street of the settlement cackling foolishly up the road came a sound of creaking axles and then a slow cloud of dust and then a bull cart bearing ransie bilbro and his wife the cart stopped at the justice s door and the two climbed down ransie was a narrow six feet of sallow brown skin and yellow hair the imperturbability of the mountains hung upon him like a suit of armour the woman was calicoed angled snuff brushed and weary with unknown desires through it all gleamed a faint protest of cheated youth unconscious of its loss the justice of the peace slipped his feet into his shoes for the sake of dignity and moved to let them enter we all said the woman in a voice like the wind blowing through pine boughs wants a divo ce she looked at ransie to see if he noted any flaw or ambiguity or evasion or partiality or self partisanship in her state ment of their business a divo ce repeated ransie with a solemn dod we all can t git along together nohow it s lonesome enough fur to live in the mount ins when a man and a

deliberately to his duties he placed his one chair and a wooden stool for his petitioners he opened his book of statutes on the table and scanned the index presently he wiped his spectacles and shifted his inkstand the law and the statutes said he air silent on the subjeck of divo ce as fur as the jurisdiction of this co t air concerned but accordin to equity and the con stitution and the golden rule it s a bad barg in that can t run both ways if a justice of the peace can marry a couple it s plain that he is bound to be able to divo ce em this here office will issue a decree of divo

and two foxes fur that he remarked it s all the money we got the regular price of a divo ce in this co t said the justice air five dollars he stuffed the bill into the pocket of his homespun vest with a deceptive air of indiffer ence with much bodily toil and mental travail he wrote the decree upon half a sheet of foolscap and then copied it upon the other ransie bilbro and his wife listened to his reading of the document that was to give them freedom know all men by these presents that ransie bilbro and his wife ariela bilbro this day personally appeared before me and promises that hereinafter

been no previous hint of alimony women were always bringing up startling and unlooked for issues justice benaja widdup felt that the point demanded judicial decision the authorities were also silent on the subject of alimony but the woman s feet were bare the trail to hogback mountain was steep and flinty ariela bilbro he asked in official tones how much did you low would be good and sufficient

climbed into the cart on one side and ariela climbed in on the other obeying the flap of his rope the little red bull slowly came around on a tack and the cart crawled away in the nimbus arising from its wheels justice of the peace benaja widdup smoked his elder stem pipe late in the afternoon he got his weekly paper and read it until the twilight dimmed its lines then he lit the tallow candle on his table and read until the moon rose marking the time for supper he lived in the double log cabin on the slope near the girdled poplar going home to supper he crossed a little branch darkened by a laurel thicket the dark figure of a man stepped from the laurels and pointed a rifle at his breast his hat was pulled down low and something covered most of his face i want yo money said the figure thout any talk i m gettin nervous and my finger s a wabblin on this here trigger i ve only got f f five dollars said the justice pro ducing it from his vest pocket roll it up came the order and stick

the muzzle of the rifle now i reckon you kin be goin along said the robber the justice lingered not on his way the next day came the little red bull drawing the cart to the office door justice benaja widdup had his shoes on for he was expecting the visit in his presence ransie bilbro handed to his wife a five dollar bill the official s eye sharply viewed it it seemed to curl up as though it had been rolled and inserted into the end of a gun barrel but the justice refrained from comment it is true that other bills might be inclined to curl he handed each one a decree of divorce each stood awkwardly silent slowly folding the guarantee of freedom the woman cast a shy glance full of constraint at ransie i reckon you ll be goin back up to the cabin she said along ith the bull cart there s

the money disappear with mournful eyes behind his spectacles and then with his next words he achieved rank as his thoughts ran with either the great crowd of the world s sympathizers or the little crowd of its great financiers be kind o lonesome in the old cabin to night ranse he said ransie bilbro stared out at the cumberlands clear blue now in the sunlight he did not look at ariela i low it might be lonesome he said but when folks gits mad and wants a divo ce you can t make folks stay there s others wanted a divo ce said ariela speaking to the wooden stool besides nobody don t want no body to stay nobody never said they didn t nobody never said they did i reckon i better start on now to brother ed s nobody can t wind that old clock want me to go back along ith you in the cart and

the gleam of promise in his words swiftly her hand went to her bosom freely as an alighting dove the bill fluttered to the justice s table her sallow cheek coloured as she stood hand in hand with ransie and listened to the reuniting words ransie helped her into the cart and climbed in beside her the little red bull turned once more and they set out hand clasped for the mountains justice of the peace benaja widdup sat in his door and took off his shoes once again he fingered the bill tucked down in his vest pocket once again he smoked his elder stem pipe once again the speck led hen swag gered down the main street of the settlement cackling foolishly a sacrifice hit the editor of the hearthstone magazine his own ideas about the selection of manuscript for his publication his theory is no secret in fact he will expound it to you willingly sitting at his mahogany desk smiling benignantly and tapping his knee gently with his gold rimmed eye glasses the hearthstone he will say does not employ a staff of readers we obtain opinions of the manuscripts submitted to us directly from types of the various classes of our readers that is the editor s theory and this is the way he carries it out when a batch of mss is received the editor stuffs every one of his pockets full of them and distributes them as he goes about during the day the office employees the hall porter the janitor the elevator man messenger boys the waiters at the caf where the editor has luncheon the man at the news stand where he buys his evening paper the grocer and milkman the guard on the uptown elevated train the ticket chopper at sixty th street the cook and maid at his home these are the readers who pass upon mss sent in to the hearthstone magazine if his pockets are not entirely emptied by the time he reaches the bosom of his family the remaining ones are handed over to his wife to read after the baby goes to sleep a few days later the editor gathers in the mss during his regular rounds and con siders the verdict of his assorted readers this system of making up a magazine has been very successful and the circulation paced by the advertising rates is making a wonderful record of speed the hearthstone company also publishes books and its imprint is to be found on several successful works all recommended says the editor by the hearthstone army of volunteer readers now and then according to talkative members of the editorial staff the hearthstone has allowed manuscripts to slip through its fingers on the advice of its heterogeneous readers that afterward proved to be famous sellers when brought out by other houses for instance the gossips say the rise and fall of silas latham was unfavourably passed upon by the elevator man the office boy unanimously rejected the boss in the bishop s carriage was contemptuously looked upon by the street car conductor the deliver ance was turned down by a clerk in the subscription department whose wife s mother had just begun a two months visit at his home the queen s quair came back from the janitor with the comment so is the book but nevertheless the hearthstone adheres to its theory and system and it will never lack volunteer readers for each one of the widely scattered staff from the young lady stenographer in the editorial office to the man who shovels in coal whose adverse decision lost to the hearth stone company the manuscript of the under world has expectations of becoming editor of the magazine some day this method of the hearthstone was well known to allen slayton when he wrote his novelette entitled love is all slayton had hung about the editorial offices of all the magazines so persistently that he was acquainted with the inner workings of every one in gotham he knew not only that the editor of the hearthstone handed his mss around among different types of people for reading but that the stories of sentimental love interest went to miss puffkin the editor s stenographer another of the editor s peculiar customs was to conceal invariably the name of the writer from his readers of mss so that a glittering name might not influence the sincerity of their reports slayton made love is all the effort of his life he gave it six months of the best work of his heart and brain it was a pure love story fine elevated romantic passionate a prose poem that set the divine blessing of love i am transposing from the manuscript high above all earthly gifts and honours and listed it in the catalogue of heaven s choicest rewards slayton s literary ambition was intense he would have sacrificed all other worldly possessions to have gained fame in his chosen art he would almost have cut off his right hand or have offered himself to the knife of the appendi citis fancier to have realized his dream of seeing one of his efforts published in the hearthstone slayton finished love is all and took it to thy hearthstone in person the office of the magazine was in a large conglomerate building presided under by a janitor as the writer stepped inside the door on his way to the elevator a potato masher flew through the hall wreck ing slayton s hat and smashing the glass of the door closely following in the wake of the utensil flew the janitor a bulky unwholesome man suspenderless and sordid panic stricken and breathless a frowsy tall woman with flying hair followed the missile the janitor s foot slipped on the tiled floor he fell in a heap with an exclamation of despair the woman pounced upon him and seized his hair the man bellowed lustily her vengeance wreaked the virago rose and stalked triumphant as minerva back to some cryptic domestic retreat at the rear the janitor got to his feet blown and humiliated this is married life he said to slayton with a certain bruised humour that s the girl i used to lay awake of nights thinking about sorry about your hat mister say don t snitch to the tenants about this will yer i don t want to lose me job slayton took the elevator at the end of the hall and went up to the offices of the hearthstone he left the ms of love is all with the editor who agreed to give him an answer as to its availability at the end of a week slayton formulated his great winning scheme on his way down it struck him with one brilliant flash and he could not refrain from admiring his own genius in conceiving the idea that very night he set about carry ing it into execution miss puffkin the hearthstone stenographer boarded in the same house with the author she was an oldish thin exclusive languishing sentimental maid and slayton had been introduced to her some time before the writer s daring and self sacrificing project was this he knew that the editor of the hearthstone relied strongly upon miss puffkin s judgment in the manuscript of romantic and sentimental fiction her taste represented the immense average of mediocre women who devour novels and stories of that type the central idea and keynote of love is all was love at first sight the enrapturing irresistible soul thrilling feeling that com pels a man or a woman to recognize his or her spirit mate as soon as heart speaks to heart suppose he should impress this divine truth upon miss puffkin personally would she not surely indorse her new and rapturous sensations by recommending highly to the editor of the hearthstone the novelette love is all slayton thought so and that night he took miss puffkin to the theatre the next night he made vehement love to her in the dim parlour of the boarding house he quoted freely from love is all and he wound up with miss puffkin s head on his shoulder and visions of literary fame dancing in his head but slayton did not stop at love making this he said to himself was the turning point of his life and like a true sportsman he went the limit on thursday night he and miss puffkin walked over to the big church in the middle of the block and were married brave slayton chateaubriand died in a garret byron courted a widow keats starved to death poe mixed his drinks de quincey hit the pipe ade lived in chica o james kept on doing it dic kens wore white socks de maupassant wore a strait jacket tom watson became a populist jeremiah wept all these authors did these things for the sake of literature but thou didst cap them all thou marriedst a wife for to carve for thyself a niche in the temple of fame on friday morning mrs slayton said she would go over to the hearthstone office hand in one or two manu ripts that the editor had given to her to read and resign her position as stenographer was there anything er that er you particu larly fancied in the stories you are going to turn in asked slayton with a thumping heart there was one a novelette that i liked so much said his wife i haven t read anything in years that i thought was half as nice and true to life that afternoon slayton hurried down to the hearth stone office he felt that his reward was close at hand with a novelette in the hearthstone literary reputation would soon be his the office boy met him at the railing in the outer office it was not for unsuccessful authors to hold personal colloquy with the editor except at rare intervals slayton hugging himself internally was nursing in his heart the exquisite hope of being able to crush the office boy with his forthcoming success he inquired concerning his novelette the office boy went into the sacred precincts and brought forth a large envelope thick with more than the bulk of a thousand diecks the boss told me to tell you he s sorry said the boy but your manuscript ain t available for the magazine slayton stood dazed can you tell me he stammered whether or no miss puff that is my i mean miss ruffkin handed in a novelette this morning that she had been asked to read sure she did answered the office boy wisely i heard the old man say that miss puffkin said it was a daisy the name of it was married for the mazuma or a working girl s triumph say you said the office boy confidentially your name s slayton ain t it i guess i mixed cases on vou without meanin to do it the boss give me some manu script to hand around the other day and i got the ones for miss puffkin and the janitor mixed i guess it s all right though and then slayton looked closer and saw on the cover of his manuscript under the title love is all the janitor s comment scribbled with a piece of charcoal the you say the roads we take twienty miles west of tucson the sunset express stopped at a tank to take on water besides the aqueous addition the engine of that famous flyer acquired some other things that were not good for it while the fireman was lowering the feeding hose bob tidball shark dodson and a quarter bred creek indian called john big dog climbed on the engine and showed the engineer three round orifices in pieces of ordnance that the carried these orifices so impressed the engineer with their possibilities that he raised both hands in a gesture such as accompanies the ejaculation do tell at the crisp command of shark dodson who was leader of the attacking force the engineer descended to the ground and uncoupled the engine and tender then john big dog perched upon the coal sportively held two guns upon the engine driver and the fireman and suggested that they run the engine fifty yards away and there await further orders shark dodson and bob tidball scorning to put such low grade ore as the passengers through the mill struck out for the rich pocket of the express car they found the messenger serene in the belief that the sunset express was taking on nothing more stimulating and dangerous than aqua pura while bob was knocking this idea out of his head with the butt end of his six shooter shark dodson was already dosing the express car safe with dynamite the safe exploded to the tune of all gold and currency the passengers thrust their heads casually out of the windows to look for the thunder cloud the conductor jerked at the bell rope which sagged down loose and unresisting at his tug shark dodson and bob tidball with their booty in a stout canvas bag tumbled out of the express car and ran awkwardly in their high heeled boots to the engine the engineer sullenly angry but wise ran the engine according to orders rapidly away from the inert train but before this was accomplished the express messenger recovered from bob tidball s persuader to neutrality jumped out of his car with a winchester rifle and took a trick in the game mr john big dog sitting on the coal tender unwittingly made a wrong lead by giving an imitation of a target and the messenger trumped him with a ball exactly between his shoulder blades the creek chevalier of industry rolled off to the ground thus increasing the share of his comrades in the loot by one sixth each two miles from the tank the engineer was ordered to stop the robbers waved a defiant adieu and plunged down the steep slope into the thick woods that lined the track five minutes of crashing through a thicket of chapparal brought them to open woods where three horses were tied to low hanging branches one was waiting for john big dog who would never ride by night or day again this animal the robbers divested of saddle and bridle and set free they mounted the other two with the bag across one pommel and rode fast and with discre tion through the forest and up a primeval lonely gorge here the animal that bore bob tidball slipped on a mossy boulder and broke a foreleg they shot him through the head at once and sat down to hold a council of flight made secure for the present by the tortuous trail they had travelled the question of time was no longer so big many miles and hours lay between them and the spryest posse that could follow shark dodson s horse with trailing rope and dropped bridle panted and cropped thankfully of the grass along the stream in the gorge bob tidball opened the sack drew out double handfuls of the neat packages of currency and the one sack of gold and chuckled with the glee of a child say you old double decked pirate he called joyfully to dodson you said we could do it you got a head for financing that knocks the horns off of anything in arizona what are we going to do about a hoss for you bob we ain t got long to wait here they ll be on our trail before daylight in the mornin oh i guess that cayuse of yourn ll carry double for a while answered the sanguine bob we ll annex the first animal we come across by jingoes we made a haul didn t we accordin to the marks on this money there s apiece it s short of what i expected said shark dodson kicking softly at the packages with the toe of his boot and then he looked pensively at the wet sides of his tired horse old bolivar s mighty nigh played out he said slowly i wish that sorrel of yours hadn t got hurt so do i said bob heartily but it can t be helped bolivar s got plenty of bottom he ll get us both far enough to get fresh mounts dang it shark i can t belp thinkin how funny it is that an easterner like you can come out here and give us western fellows cards and spades in the desperado business what part of the east was you from anyway new york state said shark dodson sitting down on a boulder and chewing a twig i was born on a farm in ulster county i ran away from home when i was seventeen it was an accident my coming west i was walkin along the road with my clothes in a bundle makin for new york city i had an idea of goin there and makin lots of money i always felt like i could do it i came to a place one evenin where the road forked and i didn t know which fork to take i studied about it for half an hour and then i took the left hand that night i run into the camp of a wild west show that was travellin among the little towns and i went west with it i ve often wondered if i wouldn t have turned out different if i d took the other road oh i reckon you d have ended up about the same said bob tidball cheerfully philosophical it ain t the roads we take it s what s inside of us that makes us turn out the way we do shark dodson got up and leaned against a tree i d a good deal rather that sorrel of yourn hadn t hurt himself bob he said again

blackjack bargainer the most disreputable thing in yancey goree s law office was goree himself sprawled in his creakv old arm chair the rickety little office built of red brick was set flush with the street the main street of the town of bethel bethel rested upon the foot hills of the blue ridge above it the mountains were piled to the sky far below it the turbid catawba gleamed yellow along its disconsolate valley the june day was at its sultriest hour bethel dozed in the tepid shade trade was not it was so still that goree reclining in his chair distinctly heard the clicking of the chips in the grand jury room where the court house gang was playing poker from the open back door of the office a well worn path meandered across the grassy lot to the court house the treading out of that path had cost goree all he ever had first inheritance of a few thousand dollars next the old family home and latterly the last shreds of his self respect and manhood the gang had cleaned him out the broken gambler had turned drunkard and parasite he had lived to see this day come when the men who had stripped him denied him a seat at the game his word was no longer to be taken the daily bouts at cards had arranged itself accordingly and to him was assigned the ignoble part of the onlooker the sheriff the county clerk a sportive deputy a gay attorney and a chalk faced man hailing from the valley sat at table and the sheared one was thus tacitly advised to go and grow more wool soon wearying of his ostracism goree had departed for his office muttering to himself as he unsteadily traversed the unlucky pathway after a drink of corn whiskey from a demijohn under the table he had flung himself into the chair staring in a sort of maudlin apathy out at the mountains immersed in the summer haze the little white patch he saw away up on the side of blackjack was laurel the village near which he had been born and bred there also was the birthplace of the feud between the gorees and the coltranes now no direct heir of the gorees survived except this plucked and singed bird of misfortune to the coltranes also but one male supporter was left colonel abner col trane a man of substance and standing a member of the state legislature and a contemporary with goree s father the feud had been a typical one of the region it had left a red record of hate wrong and slaughter but yancey goree was not thinking of feuds his befuddled brain was hopelessly attacking the problem of the future maintenance of himself and his favourite follies of late old friends of the family had seen to it that he had whereof to eat and a place to sleep but whiskey they would not buy for him and he must have whiskey his law business was extinct no case had been intrusted to him in two years he had been a borrower and a sponge and it seemed that if he fell no lower it would be from lack of opportunity one more chance he was saying to himself if he had one more stake at the game he thought he could win but he had nothing left to sell and his credit was more than exhausted he could not help smiling even in his misery as he thought of the man to whom six months before he had sold the old goree homestead there had come from back yan in the mountains two of the strangest creatures a man named pike garvey and his wife back yan with a wave of the hand toward the hills was understood among the mountaineers to designate the remotest fastnesses the unplumbed gorges the haunts of lawbreakers the wolf s den and the boudoir of the bear in the cabin far up on blackjack s shoulder in the wildest part of these retreats this odd couple had lived for twenty years they had neither dog nor children to mitigate the heavy silence of the hills pike garvey was little known in the settlements but all who had dealt with him pronounced him crazy as a loon he acknowledged no occupation save that of a squirrel hunter but he moonshined occasionally by way of diversion once the revenues had dragged him from his lair fighting silently and desperately like a terrier and he had been sent to state s prison for two years released he popped back into his hole like an angry weasel fortune passing over many anxious wooers made a freakish flight into blackjack s bosky pockets to smile upon pike and his faithful partner one day a party of spectacled knickerbockered and altogether absurd prospectors invaded the vicinity of the garvey s cabin pike lifted his squirrel rifle off the hooks and took a shot at them at long range on the chance of their being revenues happily he missed and the unconscious agents of good luck drew nearer disclosing their innocence of anything resembling law or justice later on they offered the garveys an enormous quantity of ready green crisp money for their thirty acre patch of cleared land mentioning as an excuse for such a mad action some irrelevant and inadequate nonsense about a bed of mica underlying the said property when the garveys became possessed of so many dol lars that they faltered in computing them the deficiencies of life on blackjack began to grow prominent pike began to talk of new shoes a hogshead of tobacco to set in the corner a new lock to his rifle and leading martella to a certain spot on the mountain side he pointed out to her how a small cannon doubtless a thing not beyond the scope of their fortune in price might be planted so as to command and defend the sole accessible trail to the cabin to the confusion of revenues and meddling strangers forever but adam reckoned without his eve these things represented to him the applied power of wealth but there slumbered in his dingy cabin an ambition that soared far above his primitive wants somewhere in mrs garvey s bosom still survived a spot of femininity unstarved by twenty years of blackjack for so long a time the sounds in her ears had been the scaly barks dropping in the woods at noon and the wolves singing among the rocks at night and it was enough to have purged her of vanities she had grown fat and sad and yellow and dull but when the means came she felt a rekindled desire to assume the perquisites of her sex to sit at tea tables to buy futile things to whitewash the hideous veracity of life with a little form and ceremony so she coldly vetoed pike s proposed system of fortifica tions and announced that thev would descend upon the world and gyrate socially and thus at length it was decided and the thing done the village of laurel was their compromise between mrs garvey s preference for one of the large valley towns and pike s hankering for primeval solitudes laurel yielded a halting round of feeble social distractions omportable with martella s ambitions and was not entirely without recommendation to pike its contiguity to the mountains presenting advantages for sudden retreat in case fashionable society should make it advisable their descent upon laurel had been coincident with yancey goree s feverish desire to convert property into cash and they bought the old goree homestead paying four thousand dollars ready money into the spendthrift s shaking hands thus it happened that while the disreputable last of the gorees sprawled in his disreputable office at the end of his row spurned by the cronies whom he had gorged strangers dwelt in the halls of his fathers a cloud of dust was rolling slowly up the parched street with something travelling in the midst of it a little breeze wafted the cloud to one side and a new brightly painted carryall drawn by a slothful gray horse became visible the vehicle deflected from the middle of the street as it neared goree s office and stopped in the gutter directly in front of his door on the front seat sat a gaunt tall man dressed in black broadcloth his rigid hands incarcerated in yellow kid gloves on the back seat was a lady who triumphed over the june heat her stout form was armoured in a skintight silk dress of the description known as change able being a gorgeous combination of shifting hues she sat erect waving a much omamented fan with her eyes fixed stonily far down the street however martella garvey s heart might be rejoicing at the pleasures of her new life blackjack had done his work with her exterior he had carved her countenance to the image of emptiness and inanity had imbued her with the stolidity of his crags and the reserve of his hushed interiors she always seemed to hear whatever her surroundings were the scaly barks falling and pattering down the mountain side she could always hear the awful silence of black jack sounding through the stillest of nights goree watched this solemn equipage as it drove to his door with only faint interest but when the lank driver wrapped the reins about his whip awkwardly descended and stepped into the office he rose unsteadily to receive him recognizing pike garvey the new the transformed the recently civilized the mountaineer took the chair goree offered him they who cast doubts upon garvey s soundness of mind had a strong witness in the man s countenance his face was too long a dull saffron in hue and immobile as a statue s pale blue unwinking round eyes without lashes added to the singularity of his gruesome visage goree was at a loss to account for the visit everything all right at laurel mr garvey he inquired everything all right sir and mighty pleased is missis garvey and me with the property missis garvey likes yo old place and she likes the neighbourhood society is what she lows she wants and she is gettin of it the rogerses the hapgoods the pratts and the troys hev been to see missis garvey and she hev et meals to most of thar houses the best folks hev axed her to differ nt kinds of doin s i cyan t say mr goree that sech things suits me fur me give me them thar garvey s huge yellow gloved hand flourished in the direction of the mountains that s whar i b long mongst the wild honey bees and the b ars but that ain t what i come fur to say mr goree thar s somethin you got what me and missis garvey wants to buy buy echoed goree from me then he laughed harshly i reckon you are mistaken about that i reckon you are mistaken about that i sold out to you as you yourself expressed it lock stock and barrel there isn t even a ramrod left to sell you ve got it and we uns want it take the money says missis garvey and buy it fa r and squared goree shook his head the cupboard s bare he said we ve riz pursued the mountaineer undetected from his object a heap we was pore as possums and now we could hev folks to dinner every day we been recognized missis garvey says by the best society but there s somethin we need we ain t got she says it ought to been put in the ventory ov the sale but it tain t thar take the money then says she and buy it fa r and squar out with it said goree his racked nerves growing impatient garvey threw his slouch bat upon the table and leaned forward fixing his unblinking eves upon goree s there s a old feud he said distinctly and slowly tween you uns and the coltranes goree frowned ominously to speak of his feud to a feudist is a serious breach of the mountain etiquette the man from back yan knew it as well as the lawyer did na offense he went on but purely in the way of business missis garvey hev studied all about feuds most of the quality folks in the mountains hev em the settles and the goforths the rankins and the boyds the silers and the galloways hev all been cyarin on feuds f om twenty to a hundred year the last man to drap was when yo uncle jedge paisley goree journed co t and shot len coltrane f om the bench missis garvey and me we come f om the po white trash nobody wouldn t pick a feud with we uns no mo n with a fam ly of tree toads quality people everywhar says missis garvey has feuds we uns ain t quality but we re uyin into it as fur as we can take the money then says missis garvey and buy mr goree s feud fa r and squar the squirrel hunter straightened a leg half across the room drew a roll of bills from his pocket and threw them on the table thar s two hundred dollars mr goree what you would call a fa r price for a feud that s been lowed to run down like yourn hev thar s only you left to cyar on yo side of it and you d make mighty po killin i ll take it off yo hands and it ll set me and missis garvey up among the quality thar s the money the little roll of currency on the table slowly untwisted itself writhing and jumping as its folds relaxed in the silence that followed garvey s last speech the rattling of the poker chips in the court house could be plainly heard goree knew that the sheriff had just won a pot for the subdued whoop with which he always greeted a victory floated across the sqquare upon the crinkly heat waves beads of moisture stood on goree s brow stooping he drew the wicker covered demijohn from under the table and filled a tumbler from it a little corn liquor mr garvey of course you are joking about what you spoke of opens quite a new market doesn t it feuds prime two fifty to three feuds slightly damaged two hundred i believe you said mr garvey goree laughed self consciously the mountaineer took the glass goree handed him and drank the whisky without a tremor of the lids of his staring eyes the lawyer applauded the feat by a look of envious admiration he poured his own drink and took it like a drunkard by gulps and with shudders at the smell and taste two hundred repeated garvey thar s the money a sudden passion flared up in goree s brain he struck the table with his fist one of the bills flipped over and touched his hand he flinched as if something had stung him do you come to me he shouted seriously with such a ridiculous insulting darned fool proposition it s fa r and squar said the squirrel hunter but he reached out his hand as if to take back the money and then goree knew that his own flurry of rage had not been from pride or resentment but from anger at himself knowing that he would set foot in the deeper depths that were being opened to him he turned in an instant from an outraged gentleman to an anxious chafferer recom mending his goods don t be in a hurry garvey he said his face crimson and his speech thick i accept your p p proposition though it s dirt cheap at two hundred a t trade s all right when both p purchaser and b buyer are s satisfied shall i w wrap it up for you mr garvey garvey rose and shook out his broadcloth missis garvev will be pleased you air out of it and it stands coltrane and garvey just a scrap ov writin mr goree you bein a lawyer to show we traded goree seized a sheet of paper and a pen the money was clutched in his moist hand everything else sud denly seemed to grow trivial and light bill of sale by all means right title and interest in and to forever warrant and no garvey we ll have to leave out that defend said goree with a loud laugh you ll have to defend this title yourself the mountaineer received the amazing screed that the lawyer handed him folded it with immense labour and laced it carefully in his pocket goree was standing near the window step here said raising his finger and i ll show you your recently purchased enemy there he goes down the other side of the street the mountaineer crooked his long frame to look through the window in the direction indicated by the other colonel abner coltrane an erect portly gentleman of about fifty wearing the inevitable long double breasted frock coat of the southern lawmaker and an old high silk hat was passing on the opposite sidewalk as garvey looked goree glanced at his face if there be such a thing as a yellow wolf here was its counterpart garvey snarled as his unhuman eyes followed the moving figure disclosing long amber coloured fangs is that him why that s the man who sent me to the penitentiary once he used to be district attorney said goree care lessly and by the way he s a first class shot i kin hit a squirrel s eye at a hundred yard said garvey so that thar s coltrane i made a better trade than i was thinkin i ll take keer ov this feud mr goree better n you ever did he moved toward the door but lingered there betray ing a slight perplexity anything else to day inquired goree with frothy sarcasm any family traditions ancestral ghosts or skeletons in the closet prices as low as the lowest thar was another thing replied the unmoved squirrel hunter that missis garvey was thinkin of tain t so much in my line as t other but she wanted partic lar that i should inquire and ef you was willin pay fur it she says fa r and squar thar s a buryin groun as you know mr goree in the yard of yo old place under the cedars them that lies thar is yo folks what was killed by the coltranes the monyments has the names on em missis garvev says a fam ly buryin groun is a sho sign of quality she says ef we git the feud thar s somethin else ought to go with it the names on them moiivments is goree but they can be changed to ourn by go go screamed goree his face turning purple he stretched out both hands toward the mountaineer his fingers hooked and shaking go you ghoul even a ch chinaman protects the g graves of his ancestors go the squirrel hunter slouched out of the door to his carryall while he was climbing over the wheel goree was collecting with feverish celerity the money that had fallen from his hand to the floor as the vehicle slowly turned about the sheep with a coat of newly grown wool was hurrying in indecent haste along the path to the court house at three o clock in the morning they brought him back to his office shorn and unconscious the sheriff the sportive deputy the county clerk and the gay attorney carried him the chalk faced man from the valley acting as escort on the table said one of them and they deposited him there among the litter of his unprofitable books and papers yance thinks a lot of a pair of deuces when he s liquored up sighed the sheriff reflectively too much said the gay attorney a man has no business to play poker who drinks as much as he does i wonder how much he dropped to night close to two hundred what i wonder is whar he got it yance ain t had a cent fur over a month i know struck a client maybe well let s get home before daylight he ll be all right when he wakes up except for a sort of beehive about the cranium the gang slipped away through the early morning twilight the next eye to gaze upon the miserable goree was the orb of day he peered through the uncurtained window first deluging the sleeper in a flood of faint gold but soon pouring upon the mottled red of his flesh a searching white summer heat goree stirred half unconsciously among the table s d bris and turned his face from the window his movement dislodged a heavy law book which crashed upon the floor opening his eyes he saw bending over him a man in a black frock coat looking higher he discovered a well worn silk hat and beneath it the kindly smooth face of colonel abner coltrane a little uncertain of the outcome the colonel waited for the other to make some sign of recognition not in twenty years had male members of these two families faced each other in peace goree s eyelids puckered as he strained his blurred sight toward this visitor and then he smiled serenely have you brought stella and lucy over to play he said calmly do you know me yancey asked coltrane of course i do you brought me a whip with a whistle in the end so he had twenty four years ago when yancey s father was his best friend goree s eyes wandered about the room the colonel understood lie still and i ll bring you some said he there was a pump in the yard at the rear and goree closed his eyes listening with rapture to the click of its handle and the bubbling of the falling stream col trane brought a pitcher of the cool water and held it for him to drink presently goree sat up a most forlorn object his summer suit of flax soiled and crumpled his discreditable head tousled and unsteady he tried to wave one of his hands toward the colonel ex excuse everything will you he said i must have drunk too much whiskey last night and gone to bed on the table his brows knitted into a puzzled frown out with the boys awhile asked coltrane kindly no i went nowhere i haven t had a dollar to spend in the last two months struck the demijohn too often i reckon as usual colonel coltrane touched him on the shoulder a little while ago yancey he began you asked me if i had brought stella and lucy over to play you weren t quite awake then and must have been dreaming you were a boy again you are awake now and i want you to listen to me i have come from stella and lucy to their old playmate and to my old friend s son they know that i am going to bring you home with me and you will find them as ready with a welcome as they were in the old days i want you to come to my house and stay until you are yourself aain and as much longer as you will we heard of your being down in the world and in the midst of temptation and we agreed that you should come over and play at our house once more will you come my boy will you drop our old family trouble and come with me trouble said goree opening his eyes wide there was never any trouble between us that i know of i m sure we ve always been the best friends but good lord colonel how could i go to your home as i am a drunken wretch a miserable degraded spendthrift and gambler he lurched from the table into his armchair and began to weep maudlin tears mingled with genuine drops of remorse and shame coltrane talked to him persist ently and reasonably reminding him of the simple moun tain pleasures of which he had once been so fond and insisting upon the genuineness of the invitation finally he landed goree by telling him he was counting upon his help in the engineering and transportation of a large amount of felled timber from a high mountain side to a waterway he knew that goree had once invented a device for this purpose a series of slides and chutes upon which he had justly prided himself in an instant the poor fellow delighted at the idea of his being of use to any one had paper spread upon the table and was drawing rapid but pitifully shaky lines in demonstration of what he could and would do the man was sickened of the husks his prodigal heart was turning again toward the mountains his mind was yet strangely clogged and his thoughts and memories were returning to his brain one by one like carrier pigeons over a stormy sea but coltrane was satisfied with the progress he had made bethel received the surprise of its existence that after noon when a coltrane and a goree rode amicably together through the town side by side they rode out from the dusty streets and gaping townspeople down across the creek bridge and up toward the mountain the prodigal had brushed and washed and combed himself to a more decent figure but he was unsteady in the saddle and he seemed to be deep in the contemplation of some vexing problem coltrane left him in his mood relying upon the influence of changed surroundings to restore his equilibrium once goree was seized with a shaking fit and almost came to a collapse he had to dismount and rest at the side of the road the colonel foreseeing such a con dition had provided a small flask of whisky for the journey but when it was offered to him goree refused it almost with violence declaring he would never touch it again by and by he was recovered and went quietly enough for a mile or two then he pulled up his horse suddenly and said i lost two hundred dollars last night playing poker now where did i get that money take it easy yancev the mountain air will soon clear it up we ll go fishing first thing at the pinnacle falls the trout are jumping there like bullfrogs we ll take stella and lucy along and have a picnic on eagle rock have you forgotten how a hickory cured ham sandwich tastes yancey to a hungry fisherman evidently the colonel did not believe the story of his lost wealth so goree retired again into brooding silence by late afternoon they had travelled ten of the twelve miles between bethel and laurel half a mile this side of laurel lay the old goree place a mile or two beyond the village lived the coltranes the road was now steep and laborious but the compensations were many the tilted aisles of the forest were opulent with leaf and bird and bloom the tonic air put to shame the pharma cop ia the glades were dark with mossy shade and bright with shy rivulets winking from the ferns and laurels on the lower side they viewed framed in the near foilage exquisite sketches of the far valley swooning in its opal haze coltrane was pleased to see that his companion was yielding to the spell of the hills and woods for now they had but to skirt the base of painter s cliff to cross elder branch and mount the hill beyond and goree would have to face the squandered home of his fathers every rock he passed every tree every foot of the rocky way was familiar to him though he hid forgotten the woods they thrilled him like the music of home sweet home they rounded the cliff decended into elder branch and paused there to let the horses drink and splash in the swift water on the right was a rail fence that cornered there and followed the road and stream inclosed by it was the old apple orchard of the home place the house was yet concealed by the brow of the steep hill inside and along the fence pokeberries elders sassafras and sumac grew high and dense at a rustle of their branches both goree and coltrane glanced up and saw a long yellow wolfish face above the fence staring at them with pale unwinking eyes the head quicky disappeared there was a violent swaying of the bushes and an ungainly figure ran up through the apple orchard in the direction of the house zigzagging among the trees that s garvey said coltrane the man you sold out to there s no doubt but he s considerably cracked i had to send him up for moonshining once several years ago in spite of the fact that i believed him irresponsible why what s the matter yancey goree was wiping his forehead and his face had lost its colour do i look queer too he asked trying to smile i m just remembering a few more things some of the alcohol had evaporated from his brain i recollect now where i got that two hundred dollars don t think of it said coltrane cheerfully later on we ll figure it all out together they rode out of the branch and when they reached the foot of the hill goree stopped again did you ever suspect i was a very vain kind of fellow colonel he asked sort of foolish proud about appearances the colonel s eyes refused to wander to the soiled sag ging suit of flax and the faded slouch hat it seems to me he replied mystified but humouring him i remember a young buck about twenty with the tightest coat the sleekest hair and the prancingest saddle horse in the blue ridge right you are said goree eagerly and it s in me yet though it don t show oh i m as vain as a turkey gobbler and as proud as lucifer i m going to ask you to indulge this weakness of mine in a little matter speak out yancey we ll create you duke of laurel and baron of blue ridge if you choose and you shall have a feather out of stella s peacock s tail to wear in your hat i m in earnest in a few minutes we ll pass the house up there on the hill where i was born and where my people have lived for nearly a century strangers live there now and look at me i am about to show myself to them ragged and poverty stricken a wastrel and a beggar colonel coltrane i m ashamed to do it i want you to let me wear your coat and hat until we are out of sight beyond i know you think it a foolish pride but i want to make as good a showing as i can when i pass the old place now what does this mean said coltrane to him self as he compared his companion s sane looks and quiet demeanour with his strange request but he was already unbuttoning the coat assenting readily as if the fancy were in no wise to be considered strange the coat and hat fitted goree well he buttoned the former about him with a look of satisfaction and dignity he and coltrane were nearly the same size rather tall portly and erect twenty five years were between them but in appearance they might have been brothers goree looked older than his age his face was puffy and lined the colonel had the smooth fresh complexion of a temperate liver he put on goree s disreputable old flax coat and faded slouch hat now said goree taking up the reins i m all right i want you to ride about ten feet in the rear as we go by colonel so that they can get a good look at me they ll see i m no back number yet by any means i guess i ll show up pretty well to them once more any how let s ride on he set out up the hill at a smart trot the colonel fol lowing as he had been requested goree sat straight in the saddle with head erect but his eyes were turned to the right sharply scanning every shrub and fence and hiding place in the old homestead yard once he muttered to himself will the crazy fool try it or did i dream half of it it was when he came opposite the little family burying ground that he saw what he had been looking for a puff of white smoke coming from the thick cedars in one comer he toppled so slowly to the left that coltrane had time to urge his horse to that side and catch him with one arm the squirrel hunter had not overpraised his aim he had sent the bullet where he intended and where goree had expected that it would pass through the breast of colonel abner coltrane s black frock coat goree leaned heavily against coltrane but he did not fall the horses kept pace side by side and the colonel s arm kept him steady the little white houses of laurel shone through the trees half a mile away goree reached out one hand and groped until it rested upon coltrane s fingers which held his bridle good friend he said and that was all thus did yancey goree as be rode past his old home make considering all things the best showing that was in his power the song and the sergeant half a dozen people supping at a table in one of the upper broadway all night restaurants were making too much noise three times the manager walked past them with a politely warning glance but their argument had waxed too warm to be quelled by a manager s gaze it was midnight and the restaurant was filled with patrons from the theatres of that district some among the dispersed audiences must have recognized among the quarrelsome sextet the faces of the players belonging to the carroll comedy company four of the six made up the company another was the author of the comedietta a gay coquette which the quartette of layers had been presenting with fair success at several vaudeville houses in the city the sixth at the table was a person inconsequent in the realm of art but one at whose bidding many lobsters had perished loudly the six maintained their clamorous debate no one of the party was silent except when answers were stormed from him by the excited ones that was the comedian of a gay coquette he was a young man with a face even too melancholy for his profession the oral warfare of four immoderate tongues was directed at miss clarice carroll the twinkling star of the small aggregation excepting the downcast comedian all members of the party united in casting upon her with vehemence the blame of some momentous misfortune fifty times they told her it is your fault clarice it is you alone who spoilt the scene it is only of late that you have acted this way at this rate the sketch will have to be taken off miss carroll was a match for any four gallic ancestry gave her a vivacity that could easily mount to fury her large eyes flashed a scorching denial at her accusers her slender eloquent arms constantly menaced the tableware her high clear soprano voice rose to what would have been a scream had it not possessed so pure a musical quality she hurled back at the attacking four their denunciations in tones sweet but of too great carrying power for a broadway restaurant finally they exhausted her patience both as a woman and an artist she sprang up like a panther managed to smash half a dozen plates and glasses with one royal sweep of her arm and defied her critics they rose and wrangled more loudly the comedian sighed and looked a trifle sadder and disinterested the manager came tripping and suggested peace he was told to go to the popular synonym for war so promptly that the affair might have happened at the hague thus was the manager angered he made a sign with his hand and a waiter slipped out of the door in twenty minutes the party of six was in a police station facing a grizzled and philosophical desk sergeant disorderly conduct in a restaurant said the police man who had brought the party in the author of a gay coquette stepped to the front he wore nose glasses and evening clothes even if his shoes had been tans before they met the patent leather polish bottle mr sergeant said he out of his throat like actor irving i would like to protest against this arrest the company of actors who are performing in a little play that i have written in company with a friend and myself were having a little supper we became deeply interested in the discussion as to which one of the cast is responsible for a scene in the sketch that lately has fallen so flat that the piece is about to become a failure we may have been rather noisy and intolerant of interruption by the restaurant people but the matter was of considerable importance to all of us you see that we are sober and are not the kind of people who desire to raise disturbances i hope that the case will not be pressed and that we may be allowed to go who makes the charge asked the sergeant me said a white aproned voice in the rear de restaurant sent me to de gang was raisin a rough house and breakin dishes the dishes were paid for said the playwright they were not broken purposely in her anger because we remonstrated with her for spoiling the scene miss it s not true sergeant cried the clear voice of miss clarice carroll in a long coat of tan silk and a red plumed hat she bounded before the desk it s not my fault she cried indignantly how dare they say such a thing i ve played the title r le ever since it was staged and if you want to know who made it a success ask the public that s all what miss carroll says is true in part said the author for five months the comedietta was a drawing card in the best houses but during the last two weeks it has lost favour there is one scene in it in which miss carroll made a big hit now she hardly gets a hand out of it she spoils it by acting it entirely different from her old way it is not my fault reiterated the actress there are only two of you on in the scene argued the playwright hotly you and delmars here then it s his fault declared miss carroll with a lightning glance of scorn from her dark eyes the comedian caught it and gazed with increased melancholy at the panels of the sergeant s desk the night was a dull one in that particular police station the sergeant s long blunted curiosity awoke a little i ve heard you he said to the author and then he addressed the thin faced and ascetic looking lady of the company who played aunt turnip top in the little comedy who do you think spoils the scene you are fussing about he asked i m no knocker said that lady and everybody knows it so when i say that clarice falls down every time in that scene i m judging her art and not herself she was great in it once she does it something fierce now it ll dope the show if she keeps it up the sergeant looked at the comedian you and the lady have this scene together i under stand i suppose there s no use asking you which one of you queers it the comedian avoided the direct rays from the two fixed stars of miss carroll s eyes i don t know he said looking down at his patent leather toes are you one of the actors asked the sergeant of a dwarfish youth with a middle aged face why say replied the last thespian witness you don t notice any tin spear in my hands do you you haven t heard me shout see the emperor comes since i ve been in here have you i guess i m on the stage long enough for em not to start a panic by mistaking me for a thin curl of smoke rising above the footlights in your opinion if you ve got one said the sergeant is the frost that gathers on the scene in question the work of the lady or the gentleman who takes part in it the middle aged youth looked pained i regret to say he answered that miss carroll seems to have lost her grip on that scene she s all right in the rest of the play but but i tell you sergeant she can do it she has done it equal to any of em and she can do it again miss carroll ran forward glowing and palpitating thank you jimmy for the first good word i ve had in many a day she cried and then she turned her eager face toward the desk i ll show you sergeant whether i am to blame i ll show them whether i can do that same come mr delmars let us begin you will let us won t you sergeant how long will it take asked the sergeant dubiously eight minutes said the playwright the entire play consumes but thirty you may go ahead said the sergeant most of you seem to side against the little lady maybe she had a right to crack up a saucer or two in that restaurant we ll see how she does the turn before we take that up the matron of the police station had been standing near listening to the singular argument she came nigher and stood near the sergeant s chair two or three of the reserves strolled in big and yawning before beginning the scene said the playwright and assuming that you have not seen a production of a gay coquette i will make a brief but necessary explanation it is a musical farce comedy burlesque comedietta as the title implies miss carroll s r le is that of a gay rollicking mischievous heartless coquette she sustains that character throughout the entire comedy part of the production and i have designed the extravaganza features so that she may preserve and present the same coquettish idea now the scene in which we take exception to miss carroll s acting is called the gorilla dance she is costumed to represent a wood nymph and there is a great song and dance scene with a gorilla played by mr delmars the comedian a tropical forest stage is set that used to get four and five recalls the main thing was the acting and the dance it was the funniest thing in new york for five months delmars s song i ll woo thee to my sylvan home while he and miss carroll were cutting hide and seek capers among the tropical plants was a winner what s the trouble with the scene now asked the sergeant miss carroll spoils it right in the middle of it said the playwright wrathfully with a wide gesture of her ever moving arms the actress waved back the little group of spectators leaving a space in front of the desk for the scene of her vindication or fall then she whipped off her long tan cloak and tossed it across the arm of the policeman who still stood officially among them miss carroll had gone to supper well cloaked but in the costume of the tropic wood nymph a skirt of fern leaves touched her knee she was like a humming bird green and golden and purple and then she danced a fluttering fantastic dance so agile and light and mazy in her steps that the other three members of the carroll comedy company broke into applause at the art of it and at the proper time delmars leaped out at her side mimicking the uncouth hideous bounds of the gorilla so funnily that the grizzled sergeant himself gave a short laugh like the closing of a padlock they danced together the gorilla dance and won a hand from all then began the most fantastic part of the scene the wooing of the nymph by the gorilla it was a kind of dance itself eccentric and prankish with the nymph coquettish and seductive retreat followed by the gorilla as he sang i ll woo thee to my sylvan home the song was a lyric of merit the words were non sense as befitted the play but the music was worthy of something better delmars struck into it in a rich tenor that owned a quality that shamed the flippant words during one verse of the song the wood nymph per formed the grotesque evolutions designed for the scene at the middle of the second verse she stood still with a strange look on her face seeming to gaze dreamily into the depths of the scenic forest the gorilla s last leap had brought him to her feet and there he knelt holding her hand until he had finished the haunting lyric that was set in the absurd comedy like a diamond in a piece of putty when delmars ceased miss carroll started and covered a sudden flow of tears with both hands there cried the playwright gesticulating with violence there you have it sergeant for two weeks she has spoiled that scene in just that manner at every performance i have begged her to consider that it is not ophelia or juliet that she is playing do you wonder now at our impatience tears for the gorilla song the play is lost out of her bewitchment whatever it was the wood nymph flared suddenly and pointed a desperate finger at delmars it is you you who have done this she cried wildly you never sang that song that way until lately it is your doing i give it up said the sergeant and then the gray haired matron of the police station came forward from behind the sergeant s chair must an old woman teach you all she said she went up to miss carroll and took her hand the man s wearing his heart out for you my dear couldn t you tell it the first note you heard him sing all of his monkey flip flops wouldn t have kept it from me must you be deaf as well as blind that s why you couldn t act your part child do you love him or must he be a gorilla for the rest of his days miss carroll whirled around and caught delmars with a lightning glance of her eye he came toward her melancholy did you hear mr delmars she asked with a catching breath i did said the comedian it is true i didn t think there was any use i tried to let you know with the song silly said the matron why didn t you speak no no cried the wood nymph his way was the best i didn t know but it was just what i wanted bobby she sprang like a green grasshopper and the comedian opened his arms and smiled get out of this roared the desk sergeant to the waiting waiter from the restaurant there s nothing doing here for you one dollar s worth the judge of the united states court of the district lying along the rio grande border found the following letter one morning in his mail judge when you sent me up for four years you made a talk among other hard things you called me a rattlesnake maybe i am one anyhow you hear me rattling now one year after i got to the pen my daughter died of well they said it was poverty and the disgrace together you ve got a daughter judge and i m going to make you know how it feels to lose one and i m going to bite that district attorney that spoke against me i m free now and i guess i ve turned to rattlesnake all right i feel like one i don t say much but this is my rattle look out when i strike yours respectfully rattlesnake judge derwent threw the letter carelessly aside it was nothing new to receive such epistles from desperate men whom he had been called upon to judge he felt no alarm later on he showed the letter to littlefield the young district attorney for littlefield s name was included in the threat and the judge was punctilious in matters between himself and his fellow men littlefield honoured the rattle of the writer as far as it concerned himself with a smile of contempt but he frowned a little over the reference to the judge s daughter for he and nancy derwent were to be married in the fall littlefield went to the clerk of the court and looked over the records with him they decided that the letter might have been sent by mexico sam a half breed border desperado who had been imprisoned for manslaughter four years before then official duties crowded the mat ter from his mind and the rattle of the revengeful serpent was forgotten court was in session at brownsville most of the cases to be tried were charges of smuggling counterfeiting post office robberies and violations of federal laws along the border one case was that of a young mexican rafael ortiz who had been rounded up by a clever deputy marshal in the act of passing a counterfeit silver dollar he had been suspected of many such deviations from rectitude but this was the first time that anything provable had been fixed upon him ortiz languished cozily in jail smoking brown cigarettes and waiting for trial kilpatrick the deputy brought the counterfeit dollar and handed it to the district attorney in his office in the court house the deputy and a reputable druggist were prepared to swear that ortiz paid for a bottle of medicine with it the coin was a poor counterfeit soft dull looking and made principally of lead it was the day before the morning on which the docket would reach the case of ortiz and the district attorney was preparing himself for trial not much need of having in high priced experts to prove the coin s queer is there kil smiled littlefield as he thumped the dollar down upon the table where it fell with no more ring than would have come from a lump of putty i guess the greaser s as good as behind the bars said the deputy easing up his holsters you ve got him dead if it had been just one time these mexicans can t tell good money from bad but this little yaller rascal belongs to a gang of counterfeiters i know this is the first time i ve been able to catch him doing the trick he s got a girl down there in them mexican jacals on the river bank i seen her one day when i was watching him she s as pretty as a red heifer in a flower bed littlefield shoved the counterfeit dollar into his pocket and slipped his memoranda of the case into an envelope just then a bright winsome face as frank and jolly as a boy s appeared in the doorway and in walked nancy derwent oh bob didn t court adjourn at twelve to day until to morrow she asked of littlefield it did said the district attorney and i m very glad of it i ve got a lot of rulings to look up and now that s just like you i wonder you and father don t turn to law books or rulings or something i want you to take me out plover shooting this afternoon long prairie is just alive with them don t say no please i want to try my new twelve bore hammerless i ve sent to the livery stable to engage fly and bess for the buckboard they stand fire so nicely i was sure you would go they were to be married in the fall the glamour was at its height the plovers won the day or rather the afternoon over the calf bound authorities littlefield began to put his papers away there was a knock at the door kilpatrick answered it a beautiful dark eyed girl with a skin tinged with the faintest lemon colour walked into the room a black shawl was thrown over her head and wound once around her neck she began to talk in spanish a voluble mournful stream of melancholy music littlefield did not under stand spanish the deputy did and he translated her talk by portions at intervals holding up his hand to check the flow of her words she came to see you mr littlefield her name s joya trevi as she wants to see you about well she s mixed up with that rafael ortiz she s his she s his girl she says he s innocent she says she made the money and got him to pass it don t you believe her mr little field that s the way with these mexi can girls they ll lie steal or kill for a fellow when they get stuck on him never trust a woman that s in love mr kilpatrick nancy derwent s indignant exclamation caused the deputy to flounder for a moment in attempting to explain that he had misquoted his own sentiments and then he event on with the translation she says she s willing to take his place in the jail if you ll let him out she says she was down sick with the fever and the doctor said she d die if she didn t have medicine that s why he passed the lead dollar on the drug store she says it saved her life this rafal seems to be her honey all right there s a lot of stuff in her talk about love and such things that you don t want to hear it was an old story to the district attorney tell her said he that i can do nothing the case comes up in the morning and he will have to make his fight before the court nancy derwent was not so hardened she was look ing with sympathetic interest at joya trevi as and at littlefield alternately the deputy repeated the dis trict attorney s words to the girl she spoke a sentence or two in a low voice pulled her shawl closely about her face and left the room what did she say then asked the district attorney nothing special said the deputy she said if the life of the one let s see how it went si la vida de ella a quien tu amas if the life of the girl you love is ever in danger remember rafael ortiz kilpatrick strolled out through the corridor in the direction of the marshal s office can t you do anything for them bob asked nancy it s such a little thing just one counterfeit dollar to ruin the happiness of two lives she was in danger of death and he did it to save her doesn t the law know the feeling of pity it hasn t a place in jurisprudence nan said little field especially in re the district attorney s duty i ll promise you that the prosecution will not be vindictive but the man is as good as convicted when the case is called witnesses will swear to his passing the bad dollar which i have in my pocket at this moment as exhibit a there are no mexicans on the jury and it will vote mr greaser guilty without leaving the box the plover shooting was fine that afternoon and in the excitement of the sport the case of rafael and the grief of joya trevi as was forgotten the district attor ney and nancy derwent drove out from the town three miles along a smooth grassy road and then struck across a rolling prairie toward a heavy line of timber on piedra creek beyond this creek lay long prairie the favourite haunt of the plover as they were nearing the creek they heard the galloping of a horse to their right and saw a man with black hair and a swarthy face riding toward the woods at a tangent as if he had come up behind them i ve seen that fellow somewhere said littlefield who had a memory for faces but i can t exactly place him some ranchman i suppose taking a short cut home they spent an hour on long prairie shooting from the buckboard nancy derwent an active outdoor western girl was pleased with her twelve bore she had bagged within two brace of her companion s score they started homeward at a gentle trot when within a hundred yards of piedra creek a man rode out of the timber directly toward them it looks like the man we saw coming over remarked miss derwent as the distance between them lessened the district attorney suddenly pulled up his team sharply with his eyes fixed upon the advancing horseman that individ ual had drawn a winchester from its scabbard on his saddle and thrown it over his arm now i know you mexico sam muttered littlefield to himself it was you who shook your rattles in that gentle epistle mexico sam did not leave things long in doubt he had a nice eye in all matters relating to firearms so when he was within good rifle range but outside of danger from no shot he threw up his winchester and opened fire upon the occupants of the buckboard the first shot cracked the back of the seat within the two inch space between the shoulders of littlefield and miss derwent the next went through the dashboard and littlefield s trouser leg the district attorney hustled nancy out of the buck board to the ground she was a little pale but asked no questions she had the frontier instinct that accepts conditions in an emergency without superfluous argument they kept their guns in hand and littlefield hastily gathered some handfuls of cartridges from the pasteboard box on the seat and crowded them into his pockets keep behind the horses nan he commanded that fellow is a ruffian i sent to prison once he s trying to get even he knows our shot won t hurt him at that distance all right bob said nancy steadily i m not afraid but you come close too whoa bess stand still now she stroked bess s mane littlefield stood with his gun ready praying that the desperado would come within range but mexico sam was playing his vendetta along safe lines he was a bird of different feather from the plover his accurate eye drew an imaginary line of circumference around the area of danger from bird shot and upon this line lie rode his horse wheeled to the right and as his victims rounded to the safe side of their equine breast work he sent a ball through the district attorney s hat once he miscalculated in making a d tour and over stepped ms margin littlefield s gun flashed and mexico sam ducked his head to the harmless patter of the shot a few of them stung his horse which pranced promptly back to the safety line the desperado fired again a little cry came from nancy derwent littlefield whirled with blazing eyes and saw the blood trickling down her cheek i m not hurt bob only a splinter struck me i think he hit one of the wheel spokes lord groaned littlefield if i only had a charge of buckshot the ruffian got his horse still and took careful aim fly gave a snort and fell in the harness struck in the neck bess now disabused of the idea that plover were being fired at broke her traces and galloped wildly away mexican sam sent a ball neatly through the fulness of nancy derwent s shooting jacket lie down lie down snapped littlefield close to the horse flat on the ground so he almost threw her upon the grass against the back of the recum bent fly oddly enough at that moment the words of the mexican girl returned to his mind if the life of the girl you love is ever in danger remem ber rafael ortiz littlefield uttered an exclamation open fire on him nan across the horse s back fire as fast as you can you can t hurt him but keep him dodging shot for one minute while i try to work a little scheme nancy gave a quick glance at littlefield and saw him take out his pocket knife and open it then she turned her face to obey orders keeping up a rapid fire at the enemy mexico sam waited patiently until this innocuous fusillade ceased he had plenty of time and he did not care to risk the chance of a bird shot in his eye when could be avoided by a little caution he pulled his heavy stetson low down over his face until the shots ceased then he drew a little nearer and fired with careful aim at what he could see of his victims above the fallen horse neither of them moved he urged his horse a few steps nearer he saw the district attorney rise to one knee and deliberately level his shotgun he pulled his hat down and awaited the harmless rattle of the tiny pellets the shotgun blazed with a heavy report mexico sam sighed turned limp all over and slowly fell from his horse a dead rattlesnake at ten o clock the next morning court opened and the case of the united states versus rafael ortiz was called the district attorney with his arm in a sling rose and addressed the court may it please your honour he said i desire to enter a nolle pros in this case even though the defend ant should be guilty there is not sufficient evidence in the hands of the government to secure a conviction the piece of counterfeit coin upon the identity of which the case was built is not now available as evidence i ask therefore that the case be stricken off at the noon recess kilpatrick strolled into the district attorney s office i ve just been down to take a squint at old mexico sam said the deputy they ve got him laid out old mexico was a tough outfit i reckon the boys was wonderin down there what you shot him with some said it must have been nails i never see a gun carry anything to make holes like he had i shot him said the district attorney with exhibit a of your counterfeiting case lucky thing for me and somebody else that it was as bad money as it was it sliced up into slugs very nicely say kil can t you go down to the jacals and find where that mexican girl lives miss derwent wants to know a newspaper story at a m it lay on giuseppi s news stand still damp from the presses giuseppi with the cunning of his ilk philandered on the opposite comer leaving his patrons to help themselves no doubt on a theory related to the hypothesis of the watched pot this particular newspaper was according to its custom and design an educator a guide a monitor a champion and a household counsellor and vade mecum from its many excellencies might be selected three editorials one was in simple and chaste but illuminat ing language directed to parents and teachers depreca ting corporal punishment for children another was an accusive and significant warning addressed to a notorious labour leader who was on the point of instigating his clients to a troublesome strike the third was an eloquent demand that the police force be sustained and aided in everything that tended to increase its efficiency as public guardians and servants besides these more important chidings and requisitions upon the store of good citizenship was a wise prescription or form of procedure laid out by the editor of the heart to heart column in the specific case of a young man who had complained of the obduracy of his lady love teaching him how he might win her again there was on the beauty page a complete answer to a young lady inquirer who desired admonition toward the securing of bright eyes rosy cheeks and a beautiful countenance one other item requiring special cognizance was a brief personal running thus dear jack forgive me you were right meet me comer madison and th at this morning we leave at noon penitent at o clock a young man with a haggard look and the feverish gleam of unrest in his eye dropped a penny and picked up the top paper as he passed giuseppi s stand a sleepless night had left him a late riser there was an office to be reached by nine and a shave and a hasty cup of coffee to be crowded into the interval he visited his barber shop and then hurried on his way he pocketed his paper meditating a belated perusal of it at the luncheon hour at the next corner it fell from his pocket carrying with it his pair of new gloves three blocks he walked missed the gloves and turned back fuming just on the half hour he reached the corner where lay the gloves and the paper but he strangely ignored that which he had come to seek he was holding two little hands as tightly as ever he could and looking into two penitent brown eyes while joy rioted in his heart dear jack she said i knew you would be here on time i wonder what she means by that he was saying to himself but it s all right it s all right a big wind puffed out of the west picked up the paper from the sidewalk opened it out and sent it flying and whirling down a side street up that street was driving a skittish bay to a spider wheel buggy the young man who had written to the heart to heart editor for a recipe that he might win her for whom he sighed the wind with a prankish flurry flapped the flying newspaper against the face of the skittish bay there was a lengthened streak of bay mingled with the red of running gear that stretched itself out for four blocks then a water hydrant played its part in the cosmogony the buggy became matchwood as foreordained and the driver rested very quietly where he had been flung on the asphalt in front of a certain brownstone mansion they came out and had him inside very promptly and there was one who made herself a pillow for his head and cared for no curious eyes bending over and saying oh it was you it was you all the time bobby couldn t you see it and if you die why so must i and but in all this wind we must hurry to keep in touch with our paper policeman o brine arrested it as a character dangerous to traffic straightening its dishevelled leaves with his big slow fingers he stood a few feet from the family entrance of the shandon bells caf one headline he spelled out ponderously the papers to the front in a move to help the police but whisht the voice of danny the head bartender through the crack of the door here s a nip for ye mike ould man behind the widespread amicable columns of the press policeman o brine receives swiftly his nip of the real stuff he moves away stalwart refreshed fortified to his duties might not the editor man view with pride the early the spiritual the literal fruit that had blessed his labours policeman o brine folded the paper and poked it playfully under the arm of a small boy that was passing that boy was named johnny and he took the paper home with him his sister was named gladys and she had written to the beauty editor of the paper asking for the practicable touchstone of beauty that was weeks ago and she had ceased to look for an answer gladys was a pale girl with dull eyes and a discontented expression she was dressing to go up to the avenue to get some braid beneath her skirt she pinned two leaves of the paper johnny had brought when she walked the rustling sound was an exact imitation of the real thing on the street she met the brown girl from the flat below and stopped to talk the brown girl turned green only silk at a yard could make the sound that she heard when gladys moved the brown girl consumed by jealousy said something spiteful and went her way with pinched lips gladys proceeded toward the avenue her eyes now sparkled like jagerfonteins a rosy bloom visited her cheeks a triumphant subtle vivifying smile transfigured her face she was beautiful could the beauty editor have seen her then there was something in her answer in the paper i believe about cultivating kind feelings toward others in order to make plain features attractive the labour leader against whom the paper s solemn and weighty editorial injunction was laid was the father of gladys and johnny he picked up the remains of the journal from which gladys had ravished a cosmetic of silken sounds the editorial did not come under his eye but instead it was greeted by one of those ingenious and specious puzzle problems that enthrall alike the simpleton and the sage the labour leader tore off half of the page provided himself with table pencil and paper and glued himself to his puzzle three hours later after waiting vainly for him at the appointed place other more conservative leaders declared and ruled in favour of arbitration and the strike with its attendant dangers was averted subsequent editions of the paper referred in coloured inks to the clarion tone of its successful denunciation of the labour leader s intended designs the remaining leaves of the active journal also went loyally to the proving of its potency when johnny returned from school he sought a secluded spot and removed the missing columns from the inside of his clothing where they had been artfully distributed so as to successfully defend such areas as are generally attacked during scholastic castigations johnny attended a private school and had had trouble with his teacher as has been said there was an excellent editorial against corporal punishment in that morning s issue and no doubt it had its effect after this can any one doubt the power of the press tommy s burglar at ten o clock p m felicia the maid left by the basement door with the policeman to get a raspberry phosphate around the corner she detested the police man and objected earnestly to the arrangement she pointed out not unreasonably that she might have been allowed to fall asleep over one of st george rathbone s novels on the third floor but she was overruled rasp berries and cops were not created for nothing the burglar got into the house without much difficulty because we must have action and not too much descrip tion in a word story in the dining room he opened the slide of his dark lantern with a brace and centrebit he began to bore into the lock of the silver closet suddenly a click was heard the room was flooded with electric light the dark velvet porti res parted to admit a fair haired boy of eight in pink pajamas bearing a bottle of olive oil in his hand are you a burglar he asked in a sweet childish voice listen to that exclaimed the man in a hoarse voice am i a burglar wot do you suppose i have a three days growth of bristly bread on my face for and a cap with flaps give me the oil quick and let me grease the bit so i won t wake up your mamma who is lying down with a headache and left you in charge of felicia who has been faithless to her trust oh dear said tommy with a sigh i thought you would be more up to date this oil is for the salad when i bring lunch from the pantry for you and mamma and papa have gone to the metropolitan to hear de reszke but that isn t my fault it only shows how long the story has been knocking around among the editors if the author had been wise he d have changed it to caruso in the proofs be quiet hissed the burglar under his breath if you raise an alarm i ll wring your neck like a rabbit s like a chicken s corrected tommy you had that wrong you don t wring rabbits necks aren t you afraid of me asked the burglar you know i m not answered tommy don t you suppose i know fact from fiction if this wasn t a story i d yell like an indian when i saw you and you d probably tumble downstairs and get pinched on the sidewalk i see said the burglar that you re on to your job go on with the performance tommy seated himself in an armchair and drew his toes up under him why do you go around robbing strangers mr burg lar have you no friends i see what you re driving at said the burglar with a dark frown it s the same old story your innocence and childish insouciance is going to lead me back into an honest life every time i crack a crib where there s a kid around it happens would you mind gazing with wolfish eyes at the plate of cold beef that the butler has left on the dining table said tommy i m afraid it s growing late the burglar accommodated poor man said tommy you must be hungry if you will please stand in a listless attitude i will get you something to eat the boy brought a roast chicken a jar of marmalade and a bottle of wine from the pantry the burglar seized a knife and fork sullenly it s only been an hour he grumbled since i had a lobster and a pint of musty ale up on broadway i wish these story writers would let a fellow have a pepsin tablet anyhow between feeds my papa writes books remarked tommy the burglar jumped to his feet quickly you said he had gone to the opera he hissed hoarsely and with immediate suspicion i ought to have explained said tommy he didn t buy the tickets the burglar sat again and toyed with the wishbone why do you burgle houses asked the boy wonderingly because replied the burglar with a sudden flow of tears god bless my little brown baired boy bessie at home ah said tommy wrinkling his nose you got that answer in the wrong place you want to tell your hard luck story before you pull out the child stop oh yes said the burglar i forgot well once i lived in milwaukee and take the silver said tommy rising from his chair hold on said the burglar but i moved away i could find no other employment for a while i man aged to support my wife and child by passing confederate money but alas i was forced to give that up because it did not belong to the union i became desperate and a burglar have you ever fallen into the hands of the police asked tommy i said burglar not beggar answered the cracksman after you finish your lunch said tommy and experience the usual change of heart how shall we wind up the story suppose said the burglar thoughtfully that tony pastor turns out earlier than usual to night and your father gets in from parsifal at i am thoroughly repentant because you have made me think of my own little boy bessie and say said tommy haven t you got that wrong not on your coloured crayon drawings by b cory kilvert said the burglar it s always a bessie that i have at home artlessly prattling to the pale checked burglar s bride as i was saying your father opens the front door just as i am departing with admonitions and sandwiches that you have wrapped up for me upon recognizing me as an old harvard classmate he starts back in not in surprise interrupted tommy with wide open eyes he starts back in the doorway continued the burglar and then he rose to his feet and began to shout rah rah rah rah rah rah rah rah rah well said tommy wonderingly that s the first time i ever knew a burglar to give a college yell when he was burglarizing a house even in a story that s one on you said the burglar with a laugh i was practising the dramatization if this is put on the stage that college touch is about the only thing that will make it go tommy looked his admiration you re on all right he said and there s another mistalze you ve made said the burglar you should have gone some time ago and brought me the gold piece your mother gave you on your birthday to take to bessie but she didn t give it to me to take to bessie said tommy pouting come come said the burglar sternly it s not nice of you to take advantage because the story contains an ambiguous sentence you know what i mean it s mighty little i get out of these fictional jobs anyhow i lose all the loot and i have to reform every time and all the swag i m allowed is the blamed little fol de rols and luck pieces that you kids hand over why in one story all i got was a kiss from a little girl who came in on me when i was opening a safe and it tasted of molasses candy too i ve a good notion to tie this table cover over your head and keep on into the silver closet oh no you haven t said tommy wrapping his arms around his knees because if you did no editor would buy the story you know you ve got to preserve the unities so ve you said the burglar rather glumly instead of sitting here talking impudence and taking the bread out of a poor man s mouth what you d like to be doing is hiding under the bed and screeching at the top of your voice you re right old man said tommy heartily i wonder what they make us do it for i think the s p c c ought to interfere i m sure it s neither agreeable nor usual for a kid of my age to butt in when a full grown burglar is at work and offer him a red sled and a pair of skates not to awaken his sick mother and look how they make the burglars act you d think editors would know but what s the use the burglar wiped his hands on the tablecloth and arose with a yawn well let s get through with it he said god bless you my little boy you have saved a man from committing a crime this night bessie shall pray for you as soon as i get home and give her her orders i shall never burglarize another house at least not until the june magazines are out it ll be your little sister s turn then to run in on me while i am abstracting the u s per cent from the tea urn and buy me off with her coral necklace and a falsetto kiss you haven t got all the kicks coming to you sighed tommy crawling out of his chair think of the sleep i m losing but it s tough on both of us old man i wish you could get out of the story and really rob somebody maybe you ll have the chance if they dramatize us never said the burglar gloomily between the box office and my better impulses that your leading juven iles are supposed to awaken and the magazines that pay on publication i guess i ll always be broke i m sorry said tommy sympathetically but i can t help myself any more than you can it s one of the canons of household fiction that no burglar shall be suc cessful the burglar must be foiled by a kid like me or by a young lady heroine or at the last moment by his old pal red mike who recognizes the house as one in which he used to be the coachman you have got the worst end of it in any kind of a story well i suppose i must be clearing out now said the burglar taking up his lantern and bracebit you have to take the rest of this chicken and the bottle of wine with you for bessie and her mother said tommy calmly but confound it exclaimed the burglar in an annoyed tone they don t want it i ve got five cases of chateau de beychsvelle at home that was bottled in that claret of yours is corked and you couldn t get either of them to look at a chicken unless it was stewed in champagne you know after i get out of the story i don t have so many limitations i make a turn now and then yes but you must take them said tommy loading his arms with the bundles bless you young master recited the burglar obedient second story saul will never forget you and now hurry and let me out kid our words must be nearly up tommy led the way through the hall toward the front door suddenly the burglar stopped and called to him softly ain t there a cop out there in front somewhere sparking the girl yes said tommy but what i m afraid he ll catch me said the burglar you mustn t forget that this is fiction great head said tommy turning come out by the back door a chaparral christmas gift the original cause of the trouble was about twenty years in growing at the end of that time it was worth it had you lived anywhere within fifty miles of sun down ranch you would have heard of it it possessed a quantity of jet black hair a pair of extremely frank deep brown eyes and a laugh that rippled across the prairie like the sound of a hidden brook the name of it was rosita mcmullen and she was the daughter of old man mcmullen of the sundown sheep ranch there came riding on red roan steeds or to be more explicit on a paint and a flea bitten sorrel two wooers one was madison lane and the other was the frio kid but at that time they did not call him the frio kid for he had not earned the honours of special nomenclature his name was simply johnny mcroy it must not be supposed that these two were the sum of the agreeable rosita s admirers the bronchos of a dozen others champed their bits at the long hitching rack of the sundown ranch many were the sheeps eves that were cast in those savannas that did not belong to the flocks of dan mcmullen but of all the cavaliers madison lane and johnny meroy galloped far ahead wherefore they are to be chronicled madison lane a young cattleman from the nueces country won the race he and rosita were married one christmas day armed hilarious vociferous mag nanimous the cowmen and the sheepmen laying aside their hereditary hatred joined forces to celebrate the occasion sundown ranch was sonorous with the cracking of jokes and sixshooters the shine of buckles and bright eyes the outspoken congratulations of the herders of kine but while the wedding feast was at its liveliest there descended upon it johnny meroy bitten by jealousy like one possessed i ll give you a christmas present he yelled shrilly at the door with his in his hand even then he had some reputation as an offhand shot his first bullet cut a neat underbit in madison lane s right ear the barrel of his gun moved an inch the next shot would have been the bride s had not carson a sheepman possessed a mind with triggers somewhat well oiled and in repair the guns of the wedding party had been hung in their belts upon nails in the wall when they sat at table as a concession to good taste but carson with great promptness hurled his plate of roast venison and frijoles at mcroy spoiling his aim the second bullet then only shattered the white petals of a spanish dagger flower suspended two feet above rosita s head the guests spurned their chairs and jumped for their weapons it was considered an improper act to shoot the bride and groom at a wedding in about six seconds there were twenty or so bullets due to be whizzing in the direction of mr mcroy i ll shoot better next time yelled johnny and there ll be a next time he backed rapidly out the door carson the sheepman spurred on to attempt further exploits by the success of his plate throwing was first to reach the door mcroy s bullet from the darkness laid him low the cattlemen then swept out upon him calling for vengeance for while the slaughter of a sheepman has not always lacked condonement it was a decided mis demeanour in this instance carson was innocent he was no accomplice at the matrimonial proceedings nor had any one heard him quote the line christmas comes but once a year to the guests but the sortie failed in its vengeance mcroy was on his horse and away shouting back curses and threats as he galloped into the concealing chaparral that night was the birthnight of the frio kid he became the bad man of that portion of the state the rejection of his suit by miss mcmullen turned him to a dangerous man when officers went after him for the shooting of carson he killed two of them and entered upon the life of an outlaw he became a marvellous shot with either hand he would turn up in towns and settlements raise a quarrel at the slightest opportunity pick off his man and laugh at the officers of the law he was so cool so deadly so rapid so inhumanly blood thirsty that none but faint attempts were ever made to capture him when he was at last shot and killed by a little one armed mexican who was nearly dead himself from fright the frio kid had the deaths of eighteen men on his head about half of these were killed in fair duels depending upon the quickness of the draw the other half were men whom be assassinated from absolute wantonness and cruelty many tales are told along the border of his impudent courage and daring but he was not one of the breed of desperadoes who have seasons of generosity and even of softness they say he never had mercy on the object of his anger yet at this and every christmastide it is well to give each one credit if it can be done for what ever speck of good he may have possessed if the frio kid ever did a kindly act or felt a throb of generosity in his heart it was once at such a time and season and this is the way it happened one who has been crossed in love should never breathe the odour from the blossoms of the ratama tree it stirs the memory to a dangerous degree one december in the frio country there was a ratama tree in full bloom for the winter had been as warm as springtime that way rode the frio kid and his satellite aw co murderer mexican frank the kid reined in his mustang and sat in his saddle thoughtful and grim with dangerously narrowing eyes the rich sweet scent touched him somewhere beneath his ice and iron i don t know what i ve been thinking about mex he remarked in his usual mild drawl to have forgot all about a christmas present i got to give i m going to ride over to morrow night and shoot madison lane in his own house he got my girl rosita would have had me if he hadn t cut into the game i wonder why i happened to overlook it up to now ah shucks kid said mexican don t talk foolish ness you know you can t get within a mile of mad lane s house to morrow night i see old man allen day before yesterday and he says mad is going to have christmas doings at his house you remember how you shot up the festivities when mad was married and about the threats you made don t you suppose mad lane ll kind of keep his eye open for a certain mr kid you plumb make me tired kid with such remarks i m going repeated the frio kid without heat to go to madison lane s christmas doings and kill him i ought to have done it a long time ago why mex just two weeks ago i dreamed me and rosita was married instead of her and him and we was living in a house and i could see her smiling at me and oh h l mex he got her and i ll get him yes sir on christmas eve he got her and then s when i ll get him there s other ways of committing suicide advised mexican why don t you go and surrender to the sheriff i ll get him said the kid christmas eve fell as balmy as april perhaps there was a hint of far away frostiness in the air but it tingles like seltzer perfumed faintly with late prairie blossoms and the mesquite grass when night came the five or six rooms of the ranch house were brightly lit in one room was a christmas tree for the lanes had a boy of three and a dozen or more guests were expected from the nearer ranches at nightfall madison lane called aside jim belcher and three other cowboys employed on his ranch now boys said lane keep your eyes open walk around the house and watch the road well all of you know the frio kid as they call him now and if you see him open fire on him without asking any questions i m not afraid of his coming around but rosita is she s been afraid he d come in on us every christmas since we were married the guests had arrived in buckboards and on horseback and were making themselves comfortable inside the evening went along pleasantly the guests enjoyed and praised rosita s excellent supper and after ward the men scattered in groups about the rooms or on the broad gallery smoking and chatting the christmas tree of course delighted the youngsters and above all were they pleased when santa claus himself in magnificent white beard and furs appeared and began to distribute the toys it s my papa announced billy sampson aged six i ve seen him wear em before berkly a sheepman an old friend of lane stopped rosita as she was passing by him on the gallery where he was sitting smoking well mrs lane said he i suppose by this christ mas you ve gotten over being afraid of that fellow mcroy haven t you madison and i have talked about it you know very nearly said rosita smiling but i am still nervous sometimes i shall never forget that awful time when he came so near to killing us he s the most cold hearted villain in the world said berkly the citizens all along the border ought to turn out and hunt him down like a wolf he has committed awful crimes said rosita but i don t know i think there is a spot of good somewhere in everybody he was not always bad that i know rosita turned into the hallway between the rooms santa claus in muffling whiskers and furs was just coming through i heard what you said through the window mrs lane he said i was just going down in my pocket for a christmas present for your husband but i ve left one for you instead it s in the room to your right oh thank you kind santa claus said rosita brightly rosita went into the room while santa claus stepped into the cooler air of the yard she found no one in the room but madison where is my present that santa said he left for me in here she asked haven t seen anything in the way of a present said her husband laughing unless he could have meant me the next day gabriel radd the foreman of the x ranch dropped into the post office at loma alta well the frio kid s got his dose of lead at last he remarked to the postmaster that so how d it happen one of old sanchez s mexican sheep herders did it think of it the frio kid killed bv a sheep herder the greaser saw him riding along past his camp about twelve o clock last night and was so skeered that he up with a winchester and let him have it funniest part of it was that the kid was dressed all up with white angora skin whiskers and a regular santy claus rig out from head to foot think of the frio kid playing santy a little local colour i mentioned to rivington that i was in search of characteristic new york scenes and incidents some thing typical i told him without necessarily having to spell the first syllable with an i oh for your writing business said rivington you couldn t have applied to a better shop what i don t know about little old new york wouldn t make a sonnet to a sunbonnet i ll put you right in the middle of so much local colour that you won t know whether you are a magazine cover or in the erysipelas ward when do you want to begin rivington is a young man about town and a new yorker by birth preference and incommutability i told him that i would be glad to accept his escort and guardianship so that i might take notes of manhattan s grand gloomy and peculiar idiosyncrasies and that the time of so doing would be at his own convenience we ll begin this very evening said rivington him self interested like a good fellow dine with me at seven and then i ll steer you up against metropolitan phases so thick you ll have to have a kinetoscope to record em so i dined with rivington pleasantly at his club in forty eleventh street and then we set forth in pursuit of the elusive tincture of affairs as we came out of the club there stood two men on the sidewalk near the steps in earnest conversation and by what process of ratiocination said one of them do you arrive at the conclusion that the division of society into producing and non possessing classes predicates failure when compared with competitive systems that are monopolizing in tendency and result inimically to industrial evolution oh come off your perch said the other man who wore glasses your premises won t come out in the wash you wind jammers who apply bandy legged theories to concrete categorical syllogisms send logical conclusions skallybootin into the infinitesimal ragbag you can t pull my leg with an old sophism with whiskers on it you quote marx and hyndman and kautsky what are they shines tolstoi his garret is full of rats i put it to you over the home plate that the idea of a cooperative commonwealth and an abolishment of competitive systems simply takes the rag off the bush and gives me hyperesthesia of the roopteetoop the skoo kum house for yours i stopped a few yards away and took out my little notebook oh come ahead said rivington somewhat ner vously you don t want to listen to that why man i whispered this is just what i do want to hear these slang types are among your city s most distinguishing features is this the bowery variety i really must hear more of it if i follow you said the man who had spoken flrst you do not believe it possible to reorganize society on the basis of common interest shinny on your own side said the man with glasses you never heard any such music from my foghorn what i said was that i did not believe it practicable just now the guys with wads are not in the frame of mind to slack up on the mazuma and the man with the portable tin banqueting canister isn t exactly ready to join the bible class you can bet your variegated socks that the situation is all spifflicated up from the battery to breakfast what the country needs is for some bully old bloke like cobden or some wise guy like old ben frank lin to sashay up to the front and biff the nigger s head with the baseball do you catch my smoke what rivington pulled me by the arm impatiently please come on he said let s go see something this isn t what you want indeed it is i said resisting this tough talk is the very stuff that counts there is a picturesqueness about the speech of the lower order of people that is quite unique did you say that this is the bowery variety of slang oh well said rivington giving it up i ll tell you straight that s one of our college professors talking he ran down for a day or two at the club it s a sort of fad with him lately to use slang in his conversation he thinks it improves language the man he is talking to is one of new york s famous social economists now will you come on you can t use that you know no i agreed i can t use that would you call that typical of new york of course not said rivington with a sigh of relief i m glad you see the difference but if you want to hear the real old tough bowery slang i ll take you down where you ll get your fill of it i would like it i said that is if it s the real thing i ve often read it in books but i never heard it do you think it will be dangerous to go unprotected among those characters oh no said rivington not at this time of night to tell the truth i haven t been along the bowery in a long time but i know it as well as i do broadway we ll look up some of the typical bowery boys and get them to talk it ll be worth your while they talk a peculiar dialect that you won t hear any where else on earth rivington and i went east in a forty second street car and then south on the third avenue line at houston street we got off and walked we are now on the famous bowery said rivington the bowery celebrated in song and story we passed block after block of gents furnishing stores the windows full of shirts with prices attached and cuffs inside in other windows were neckties and no shirts people walked up and down the sidewalks in some ways said i this reminds me of koko mono ind during the peach crating season rivington was nettled step into one of these saloons or vaudeville shows said he with a large roll of money and see how quickly the bowery will sustain its reputation you make impossible conditions said i coldly by and by rivington stopped and said we were in the heart of the bowery there was a policeman on the corner whom rivington knew hallo donahue said my guide how goes it my friend and i are down this way looking up a bit of local colour he s anxious to meet one of the bowery types can t you put us on to something genuine in that line something that s got the colour you know policeman donahue turned himself about ponder ously his florid face full of good nature he pointed with his club down the street sure he said huskily here comes a lad now that was born on the bowery and knows every inch of it if he s ever been above bleecker street he s kept it to himself a man about twenty eight or twenty nine with a smooth face was sauntering toward us with his hands in his coat pockets policeman donahue stopped him with a courteous wave of his club evening kerry he said here s a couple of gents friends of mine that want to hear you spiel something about the bowery can you reel em off a few yards certainly donahue said the young man pleas antly good evening gentlemen he said to us with a pleasant smile donahue walked off on his beat this is the goods whispered rivington nudging me with his elbow look at his jaw say cull said rivington pushing back his hat wot s doin me and my friend s taking a look down de old line see de copper tipped us off dat you was wise to de bowery is dat right i could not help admiring rivington s power of adapt ing himself to his surroundings donahue was right said the young man frankly i was brought up on the bowery i have been news boy teamster pugilist member of an organized band of toughs bartender and a sport in various mean ings of the word the experience certainly warrants the supposition that i have at least a passing acquaintance with a few phases of bowery life i will be pleased to place whatever knowledge and experience i have at the service of my friend donahue s friends rivington seemed ill at ease i say he said somewhat entreatingly i thought you re not stringing us are you it isn t just the kind of talk we expected you haven t even said hully gee once do you really belong on the bowery i am afraid said the bowery boy smilingly that at some time you have been enticed into one of the dives of literature and had the counterfeit coin of the bowery passed upon you the argot to which you doubtless refer was the invention of certain of your literary dis coverers who invaded the unknown wilds below third avenue and put strange sounds into the mouths of the inhabitants safe in their homes far to the north and west the credulous readers who were beguiled by this new dialect perused and believed like marco polo and mungo park pioneers indeed but ambitious souls who could not draw the line of demarcation between dis covery and invention the literary bones of these explorers are dotting the trackless wastes of the sub way while it is true that after the publication of the mythical language attributed to the dwellers along the bowery certain of its pat phrases and apt metaphors were adopted and to a limited extent used in this locality it was because our people are prompt in assimilating whatever is to their commercial advantage to the tourists who visited our newly discovered clime and who expected a realization of their literary guide books they supplied the demands of the market but perhaps i am wandering from the question in what way can i assist you gentlemen i beg you will believe that the hospitality of the street is extended to all there are i regret to say many catchpenny places of entertainment but i cannot conceive that they would entice you i felt rivington lean somewhat heavily against me say he remarked with uncertain utterance come and have a drink with us thank you but i never drink i find that alcohol even in the smallest quantities alters the perspective and i must preserve my perspective for i am studyinc the bowery i have lived in it nearly thirty years and i am just beginning to understand its heartbeats it is like a great river fed by a hundred alien streams each influx brings strange seeds on its flood strange silt and weeds and now and then a flower of rare promise to construe this river requires a man who can build dykes against the overflow who is a naturalist a geologist a humanitarian a diver and a strong swimmer i love my bowery it was my cradle and is my inspiration i have published one book the critics have been kind i put my heart in it i am writing another into which i hope to put both heart and brain consider me your guide gentlemen is there arything i can take you to see any place to which i can conduct you i was afraid to look at rivington except with one eye thanks said rivington we were looking up that is my friend confound it it s against all precedent you know awfully obliged just the same in case said our friend you would like to meet some of our bowery young men i would be pleased to have you visit the quarters of our east side kappa delta phi society only two blocks east of here awfully sorry said rivington but my friend s got me on the jump to nioht he s a terror when he s out after local colour now there s nothing i would like better than to drop in at the kappa delta phi but some other time we said our farewells and boarded a home bound car we had a rabbit on upper broadway and then i parted with rivington on a street corner well anyhow said he braced and recovered it couldn t have happened anywhere but in little old new york which to say the least was typical of rivington georgia s ruling if you should chance to visit the general land office step into the draughtsmen s room and ask to be shown the map of salado county a leisurely german pos sibly old kampfer himself will bring it to you it will be four feet square on heavy drawing cloth the lettering and the figures will be beautifully clear and distinct the title will be in splendid undecipherable german text ornamented with classic teutonic designs very likely ceres or pomona leaning against the initial letters with cornucopias venting grapes and wieners you must tell him that this is not the map you wish to see that he will kindly bring you its official predecessor he will then say ach so and bring out a map half the size of the first dim old tattered and faded by looking carefully near its northwest corner you will presently come upon the worn contours of chiquito river and maybe if your eyes are good discern the silent witness to this story the commissioner of the land office was of the old style his antique courtesy was too formal for his day he dressed in fine black and there was a suggestion of roman drapery in his long coat skirts his collars were undetached blame haberdashery for the word his tie was a narrow funereal strip tied in the same knot as were his shoe strings his gray hair was a trifle too long behind but he kept it smooth and orderly his face was clean shaven like the old statesmen s most people thought it a stern face but when its official expression was off a few had seen altogether a different countenance especially tender and gentle it had appeared to those who were about him during the last illness of his only child the commissioner had been a widower for years and his life outside his official duties had been so devoted to little georgia that people spoke of it as a touching and admirable thing he was a reserved man and dignified almost to austerity but the child had come below it all and rested upon his very heart so that she scarcely missed the mother s love that had been taken away there was a wonderful companionship between them for she had many of his own ways being thoughtful and serious beyond her years one day while she was lying with the fever burning brightly in her checks she said suddenly papa i wish i could do something good for a whole lot of children what would you like to do dear asked the com missioner give them a party oh i don t mean those kind i mean poor children who haven t homes and aren t loved and cared for as i am i tell you what papa what my own child if i shouldn t get well i ll leave them you not give you but just lend you for you must come to mamma and me when you die too if you can find time wouldn t you do something to help them if i ask you papa hush hush dear dear child said the commissioner holding her hot little hand against his cheek you ll get well real soon and you and i will see what we can do for them together but in whatsoever paths of benevolence thus vaguely premeditated the commissioner might tread he was not to have the company of his beloved that night the little frail body grew suddenly too tired to struggle further and georgia s exit was made from the great stage when she had scarcely begun to speak her little piece before the footlights but there must be a stage manager who understands she had given the cue to the one who was to speak after her a week after she was laid away the commissioner reappeared at the office a little more courteous a little paler and sterner with the black frock coat hanging a little more loosely from his tall figure his desk was piled with work that had accumulated during the four heartbreaking weeks of his absence his chief clerk had done what he could but there were ques tions of law of fine judicial decisions to be made concern ing the issue of patents the marketing and leasing of school lands the classification into grazing agricultural watered and timbered of new tracts to be opened to settlers the commissioner went to work silently and ob stinately putting back his grief as far as possible forcing his mind to attack the complicated and important busi ness of his office on the second day after his return he called the porter pointed to a leather covered chair that stood near his own and ordered it removed to a lumber room at the top of the building in that chair georgia would always sit when she came to the office for him of afternoons as time passed the commissioner seemed to grow more silent solitary and reserved a new phase of mind developed in him he could not endure the presence of a child often when a clattering youngster belonging to one of the clerks would come chattering into the big business room adjoining his little apartment the com missioner would steal softly and close the door he would always cross the street to avoid meeting the school children when they came dancing along in happy groups upon the sidewalk and his firm mouth would close into a mere line it was nearly three months after the rains had washed the last dead flower petals from the mound above little georgia when the land shark firm of hamlin and avery filed papers upon what they considered the fattest vacancy of the year it should not be supposed that all who were termed land sharks deserved the name many of them were reputable men of good business character some of them could walk into the most august councils of the state and say gentlemen we would like to have this and that and matters go thus but next to a three years drought and the boll worm the actual settler hated the land shark the land shark haunted the land office where all the land records were kept and hunted vacancies that is tracts of unappro priated public domain generally invisible upon the official maps but actually existing upon the ground the law entitled any one possessing certain state scrip to file by virtue of same upon any land not previously legally appropriated most of the scrip was now in the hands of the land sharks thus at the cost of a few hundred dollars they often secured lands worth as many thousands naturally the search for vacancies was lively but often very often the land they thus secured though legally unappropriated would be occupied by happy and contented settlers who had laboured for years to build up their homes only to discover that their titles were worthless and to receive peremptory notice to quit thus came about the bitter and not unjustifiable hatred felt by the toiling settlers toward the shrewd and seldom merciful speculators who so often turned them forth destitute and homeless from their fruitless labours the history of the state teems with their antagonism mr land shark seldom showed his face on locations from which he should have to eject the unfortunate victims of a monstrously tangled land system but let his emis saxies do the work there was lead in every cabin moulded into balls for him many of his brothers had enriched the grass with their blood the fault of it all lay far back when the state was young she felt the need of attract ing newcomers and of rewarding those pioneers already within her borders year after year she issued land scrip headrights bounties veteran donations confeder ates and to railroads irrigation companies colonies and tillers of the soil galore all required of the grantee was that he or it should have the scrip properly surveyed upon the public domain by the county or district surveyor and the land thus appropriated became the property of him or it or his or its heirs and assigns forever in those days and here is where the trouble began the state s domain was practically inexhaustible and the old surveyors with princely yea even western american liberality gave good measure and over flowing often the jovial man of metes and bounds would dispense altogether with the tripod and chain mounted on a pony that could cover something near a vara at a step with a pocket compass to direct his course he would trot out a survey by counting the beat of his pony s hoofs mark his corners and write out his field notes with the complacency produced by an act of duty well performed sometimes and who could blame the surveyor when the pony was feeling his oats he might step a little higher and farther and in that case the beneficiary of the scrip might get a thousand or two more acres in his survey than the scrip called for but look at the boundless leagues the state had to spare however no one ever had to complain of the pony under stepping nearly every old survey in the state con tained an excess of land in later years when the state became more populous and land values increased this careless work entailed incalculable trouble endless litigation a period of riotous land grabbing and no little bloodshed the land sharks voraciously attacked these excesses in the old surveys and filed upon such portions with new scrip as unappropriated public domain wherever the identi fications of the old tracts were vague and the corners were not to be clearly established the land office would recognize the newer locations as valid and issue title to the locators here was the greatest hardship to be found these old surveys taken from the pick of the land were already nearly all occupied by unsuspecting and peaceful settlers and thus their titles were demolished and the choice was placed before them either to buy their land over at a double price or to vacate it with their families and personal belongings immediately land locators sprang up by hundreds the country was held up and searched for vacancies at the point of a compass hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of splendid acres were wrested from their innocent purchasers and holders there began a vast hegira of evicted settlers in tattered wagons going nowhere cursing injustice stunned purposeless homeless hopeless their children began to look up to them for bread and cry it was in consequence of these conditions that hamil ton and avery had filed upon a strip of land about a mile wide and three miles long comprising about two thou sand acres it being the excess over complement of the elias denny three league survey on chiquito river in one of the middle western counties this two thousand acre body of land was asserted by them to be vacant land and improperly considered a part of the denny survey they based this assertion and their claim upon the land upon the demonstrated facts that the beginning corner of the denny survey was plainly identified that its field notes called to run west varas and then called for chiquito river thence it ran south with the meanders and so on and that the chiquito river was on the ground fully a mile farther west from the point reached by course and distance to sum up there were two thousand acres of vacant land between the denny survey proper and chiquito river one sweltering day in july the commissioner called for the papers in connection with this new location they were brought and heaped a foot deep upon his desk field notes statements sketches affidavits connecting lines documents of every description that shrewdness and money could call to the aid of hamlin and avery the firm was pressing the commissioner to issue a patent upon their location they possesed inside infor mation concerning a new railroad that would probably pass somewhere near this land the general land office was very still while the com missioner was delving into the heart of the mass of evi dence the pigeons could be heard on the roof of the old castle like building cooing and fretting the clerks were droning everywhere scarcely pretending to earn their salaries each little sound echoed hollow and loud from the bare stone flagged floors the plastered walls and the iron joisted ceiling the impalpable perpetual lime stone dust that never settled whitened a long streamer of sunlight that pierced the tattered window awning it seemed that hamlin and avery had builded well the denny survey was carelessly made even for a care less period its beginning corner was identical with that of a well defined old spanish grant but its other calls were sinfully vague the field notes contained no other object that survived no tree no natural object save chiquito river and it was a mile wrong there according to precedent the office would be justified in giving it its complement by course and distance and considering the remainder vacant instead of a mere excess the actual settler was besieging the office with wild protests in re having the nose of a pointer and the eye of a hawk for the land shark he had observed his myrmi dons running the lines upon his ground making inquiries he learned that the spoiler had attacked his home and he left the plough in the furrow and took his pen in hand one of the protests the commissioner read twice it was from a woman a widow the granddaughter of elias denny himself she told how her grandfather had sold most of the survey years before at a trivial price land that was now a principality in extent and value her mother had also sold a part and she herself had succeeded to this western portion along chiquito river much of it she had been forced to part with in order to live and now she owned only about three hundred acres on which she had her home her letter wound up rather pathetically i ve got eight children the oldest fifteen years i work all day and half the night to till what little land i can and keep us in clothes and books i teach my children too my neighbours is all poor and has big families the drought kills the crops every two or three years and then we has hard times to get enough to eat there is ten families on this land what the land sharks is trying to rob us of and all of them got titles from me i sold to them cheap and they aint paid out yet but part of them is and if their land should be took from them i would die my grandfather was an honest man and he helped to build up this state and he taught his children to be honest and how could i make it up to them who bought me mr commissioner if you let them land sharks take the roof from over my children and the little from them as they has to live on whoever again calls this state great or its government just will have a lie in their mouths the commissioner laid this letter aside with a sigh many many such letters he had received he had never been hurt by them nor had he ever felt that they appealed to him personally he was but the state s servant and must follow its laws and yet somehow this reflection did not always eliminate a certain responsible feeling that hung upon him of all the state s officers he was supremest in his department not even excepting the governor broad general land laws he followed it was true but he had a wide latitude in particular ramifica tions rather than law what he followed was rulings office rulings and precedents in the complicated and new questions that were being engendered by the state s development the commissioner s ruling was rarely appealed from even the courts sustained it when its equity was apparent the commissioner stepped to the door and spoke to a clerk in the other room spoke as he always did as if he were addressing a prince of the blood mr weldon will you be kind enough to ask mr ashe the state school land appraiser to please come to my office as soon as convenient ashe came quickly from the big table where he was arranging his reports mr ashe said the commissioner you worked along the chiquito river in salado colinty during your last trip i believe do you remember anything of the elias denny three league survey yes sir i do the blunt breezy surveyor answered i crossed it on my way to block h on the north side of it the road runs with the chiquito river along the valley the denny survey fronts three miles on the chiquito it is claimed continued the commissioner that it fails to reach the river by as much as a mile the appraiser shrugged his shoulder he was by birth and instinct an actual settler and the natural foe of the land shark it has always been considered to extend to the river he said dryly but that is not the point i desired to discuss said the commissioner what kind of country is this valley portion of let us say then the denny tract the spirit of the actual settler beamed in ashe s face beautiful he said with enthusiasm valley as level as this floor with just a little swell on like the sea and rich as cream just enough brakes to shelter the cattle in winter black loamy soil for six feet and then clay holds water a dozen nice little houses on it with windmills and gardens people pretty poor i guess too far from market but comfortable never saw so many kids in my life they raise flocks inquired the commissioner ho ho i mean two legged kids lauched the surveyor two legged and bare legged and tow headed children oh children mused the commissioner as though a new view had opened to him they raise children it s a lonesome country commissioner said the surveyor can you blame em i suppose continued the commissioner slowly as one carefully pursues deductions from a new stupendous theory not all of them are tow headed it would not be unreasonable mr ashe i conjecture to believe that a portion of them have brown or even black hair brown and black sure said ashe also red no doubt said the commissioner well i thank you for your courtesy in informing me mr ashe i will not detain you any longer from your duties later in the afternoon came hamlin and avery big handsome genial sauntering men clothed in white duck and low cut shoes they permeated the whole office with an aura of debonair prosperity they passed among the clerks and left a wake of abbreviated given names and fat brown cigars these were the aristocracy of the land sharks who went in for big things full of serene confidence in them selves there was no corporation no syndicate no rail road company or attorney general too big for them to tackle the peculiar smoke of their rare fat brown cigars was to be perceived in the sanctum of every department of state in every committee room of the legislature in every bank parlour and every private caucus room in the state capital always pleasant never in a hurry in seeming to possess unlimited leisure people wondered when they gave their attention to the many audacious enterprises in which they were knnown to be engaged by and by the two dropped carelessly into the com missioner s room and reclined lazily in the big leather upholstered arm chairs they drawled a good natured complaint of the weather and hamlin told the com missioner an excellent story he had amassed that morn ing from the secretary of state but the commissioner knew why they were there he had half promised to render a decision that day upon their location the chief clerk now brought in a batch of duplicate certificates for the commissioner to sign as he traced his sprawling signature hollis summerfield comr genl land office on each one the chief clerk stood deftly removing them and applying the blotter i notice said the chief clerk you ve been going through that salado county location kampfer is mak ing a new map of salado and i believe is platting in that section of the county now i will see it said the comissioner a few moments later he went to the draughtsmen s room as he entered he saw five or six of the draughtsmen grouped about kampfer s desk gargling away at each other in pectoral german and gazing at something there upon at the commissioner s approach they scattered to their several places kampfer a wizened little ger man with long frizzled ringlets and a watery eye began to stammer forth some sort of an apology the commis sioner thought for the congregation of his fellows about his desk never mind said the commissioner i wish to see the map you are making and passing around the old german seated himself upon the high draughtsman s stool kampfer continued to break english in trving to explain herr gommissioner i assure you blenty sat i haf not it bremeditated sat it wass sat it itself make look you from se field notes wass it blatted blease to observe se calls south degrees west varas south degrees east varas south south west south degrees west and so on herr gommissioner nefer would i have the commissioner raised one white hand silently kampfer dropped his pipe and fled with a hand at each side of his face and his elbows resting upon the desk the commissioner sat staring at the map which was spread and fastened there staring at the sweet and living profile of little georgia drawn thereupon at her face pensive delicate and infantile outlined in a perfect likeness when his mind at length came to inquire into the rea son of it he saw that it must have been as kampfer had said unpremeditated the old draughtsman had been platting in the elias denny survey and georgia s likeness striking though it was was formed by nothing more than the meanders of chiquito river indeed kampfer s blotter whereon his preliminary work was done showed the laborious tracings of the calls and the countless pricks of the compasses then over his faint pencilling kampfer had drawn in india ink with a full firm pen the similitude of chiquito river and forth had blossomed mysteriously the dainty pathetic profile of the child the commissioner sat for half an hour with his face in his hands gazing downward and none dared approach him then he arose and walked out in the business office he paused long enough to ask that the denny file be brought to his desk he found hamlin and avery still reclining in their chairs apparently oblivious of business they were lazily discussing summer opera it being their habit perhaps their pride also to appear supernaturally indifferent whenever they stood with large interests imperilled and they stood to win more on this stake than most people knew they possessed inside infor mation to the effect that a new railroad would within a year split this very chiquito river valley and send land values ballooning all along its route a dollar under thirty thousand profit on this location if it should hold good would be a loss to their expectations so while they chatted lightly and waited for the commissioner to open the subject there was a quick sidelong sparkle in their eyes evincing a desire to read their title clear to those fair acres on the chiquito a clerk brought in the file the commissioner seated himself and wrote upon it in red ink then he rose to his feet and stood for a while looking straight out of the window the land office capped the summit of a bold hill the eyes of the commissioner passed over the roofs of many houses set in a packing of deep green the whole checkered by strips of blinding white streets the horizon where his gaze was focussed swelled to a fair wooded eminence flecked with faint dots of shining white there was the cemetery where lay many who were forgot ten and a few who had not lived in vain and one lay there occupying very small space whose childish heart had been large enough to desire while near its last beats good to others the commissioner s lips moved slightly as he whispered to himself it was her last will and testament and i have neglected it so long the big brown cigars of hamlin and avery were fireless but they still gripped them between their teeth and waited while they marvelled at the absent expression upon the commissioner s face by and by he spoke suddenly and promptly gentlemen i have just indorsed the elias denny survey for patenting this office will not regard your location upon a part of it as legal he paused a moment and then extending his hand as those dear old time ones used to do in debate he enunciated the spirit of that ruling that subsequently drove the land sharks to the wall and placed the seal of peace and security over the doors of ten thousand homes and furthermore he continued with a clear soft light upon his face it may interest you to know that from this time on this office will consider that when a survey of land made by virtue of a certificate granted by this state to the men who wrested it from the wilderness and the savage made in good faith settled in good faith and left in good faith to their children or innocent pur chasers when such a survey although overrunning its complement shall call for any natural object visible to the eye of man to that object it shall hold and be good and valid and the children of this state shall lie down to sleep at night and rumours of disturbers of title shall not disquiet them for concluded the commissioner of such is the kingdom of heaven in the silence that followed a laugh floated up from the patent room below the man who carried down the denny file was exhibiting it among the clerks look here he said delightedly the old man has forgotten his name he s written patent to original grantee and signed it georgia summerfield comr the speech of the commissioner rebounded lightly from the impregnable hamlin and avery they smiled rose gracefully spoke of the baseball team and argued feelingly that quite a perceptible breeze had arisen from the east they lit fresh fat brown cigars and drifted courteously away but later they made another tiger spring for their quarry in the courts but the courts according to reports in the papers coolly roasted them a remarkable performance suggestive of liquid air didoes and sustained the commissioner s ruling and this ruling itself grew to be a precedent and the actual settler framed it and taught his children to spell from it and there was sound sleep o nights from the pines to the sage brush and from the chaparral to the great brown river of the north but i think and i am sure the commissioner never thought otherwise that whether kampfer was a snuffy old instrument of destiny or whether the meanders of the chiquito accidentally platted themselves into that memo rable sweet profile or not there was brought about some thing good for a whole lot of children and the result ought to be called georgia s ruling blind man s holiday alas for the man and for the artist with the shifting point of perspective life shall be a confusion of ways to the one the landscape shall rise up and confound the other take the case of lorison at one time he appeared to himself to be the feeblest of fools at another he conceived that he followed ideals so fine that the world was not yet ready to accept them during one mood he cursed his folly possessed by the other he bore himself with a serene grandeur akin to greatness in neither did he attain the perspective generations before the name had been larsen his race had bequeathed him its fine strung melancholy temperament its saving balance of thrift and industry from his point of perspective he saw himself an outcast from society forever to be a shady skulker along the ragged edge of respectability a denizen des trois quartz de monde that pathetic spheroid lying between the haut and the demi whose inhabitants envy each of their neigh bours and are scorned by both he was self condemned to this opinion as he was self exiled through it to this quaint southern city a thousand miles from his former home here he had dwelt for longer than a year know ing but few keeping in a subjective world of shadows which was invaded at times by the perplexing bulks of jarring realities then he fell in love with a girl whom he met in a cheap restaurant and his story begins the rue chartres in new orleans is a street of ghosts it lies in the quarter where the frenchman in his prime set up his translated pride and glory where also the arrogant don had swaggered and dreamed of gold and grants and ladies gloves every flagstone has its grooves worn by footsteps going royally to the wooing and the fighting every house has a princely heartbreak each doorway its untold tale of gallant promise and slow decay by night the rue chartres is now but a murky fissure from which the groping wayfarer sees flung against the sky the tangled filigree of moorish iron balconies ths old houses of monsieur stand yet indomitable against the century but their essence is gone the street is one of ghosts to whosoever can see them a faint heartbeat of the street s ancient glory still sur vives in a corner occupied by the caf carabine d or once men gathered there to plot against kings and to warn presidents they do so yet but they are not the same kind of men a brass button will scatter these those would have set their faces against an army above the door hangs the sign board upon which has been depicted a vast animal of unfamiliar species in the act of firing upon this monster is represented an unobtrusive human levelling an obtrusive gun once the colour of bright gold now the legend above the picture is faded beyond conjecture the gun s relation to the title is a matter of faith the menaced animal wearied of the long aim of the hunter has resolved itself into a shapeless blot the place is known as antonio s as the name white upon the red lit transparency and gilt upon the windows attests there is a promise in antonio a justifiable expectancy of savoury things in oil and pepper and wine and perhaps an angel s whisper of garlic but the rest of the name is o riley antonio o riley the carabine d or is an ignominious ghost of the rue chartres the caf where bienville and conti dined where a prince has broken bread is become a family ristaurant its customers are working men and women almost to a unit occasionally you will see chorus girls from the cheaper theatres and men who follow avocations sub ject to quick vicissitudes but at antonio s name rich in bohemian promise but tame in fulfillment manners debonair and gay are toned down to the family stand ard should you light a cigarette mine host will touch you on the arrum and remind you that the proprieties are menaced antonio entices and beguiles from fiery legend without but o riley teaches decorum within it was at this restaurant that lorison first saw the girl a flashy fellow with a predatory eye had followed her in and had advanced to take the other chair at the little table where she stopped but lorison slipped into the seat before him their acquaintance began and grew and how for two months they had sat at the same table each evening not meeting by appointment but as if by a series of fortuitous and happy accidents after dining they would take a walk together in one of the little city parks or among the panoramic markets where exhibits a con tinuous vaudeville of sights and sounds always at eight o clock their steps led them to a certain street corner where she prettily but firmly bade him good night and left him i do not live far from here she frequently said and you must let me go the rest of the way alone but now lorison had discovered that he wanted to go the rest of the way with her or happiness would depart leaving him on a very lonely corner of life and at the same time that he made the discovery the secret of his banishment from the society of the good laid its finger in his face and told him it must not be man is too thoroughly an egoist not to be also an egotist if he love the object shall know it during a lifetime he may conceal it through stress of expediency and honour but it shall bubble from his dying lips though it disrupt a neighbourhood it is known however that most men do not wait so long to disclose their passion in the case of lorison his particular ethics positively forbade him to declare his sentiments but he must needs dally with the subject and woo by innuendo at least on this night after the usual meal at the carabine d or he strolled with his companion down the dim old street toward the river the rue chartres perishes in the old place d armes the ancient cabildo where spanish justice fell like hail faces it and the cathedral another provincial ghost overlooks it its centre is a little iron railed park of flowers and immaculate gravelled walks where citizens take the air of evenings pedestalled high above it the general sits his cavorting steed with his face turned stonily down the river toward english turn whence come no more britons to bombard his cotton bales often the two sat in this square but to night lorison guided her past the stone stepped gate and still riverward as they walked he smiled to himself to think that all he knew of her except that be loved her was her name norah greenway and that she lived with her brother they had talked about everything except themselves perhaps her reticence had been caused by his they came at length upon the levee and sat upon a great prostrate beam the air was pungent with the dust of commerce the great river slipped yellowly past across it algiers lay a longitudinous black bulk against a vibrant electric haze sprinkled with exact stars the girl was young and of the piquant order a certain bright melancholy pervaded her she possessed an untarnished pale prettiness doomed to please her voice when she spoke dwarfed her theme it was the voice capable of investing little subjects with a large interest she sat at ease bestowing her skirts with the little womanly touch serene as if the begrimed pier were a summer garden lorison poked the rotting boards with his cane he began by telling her that he was in love with some one to whom he durst not speak of it and why not she asked accepting swiftly his fatuous presentation of a third person of straw my place in the world he answered is none to ask a woman to share i am an outcast from honest people i am wrongly accused of one crime and am i believe guilty of another thence he plunged into the story of his abdication from society the story pruned of his moral philosophy deserves no more than the slightest touch it is no new tale that of the gambler s declension during one night s sitting he lost and then had imperilled a certain amount of his employer s money which by accident he carried with him he continued to lose to the last wager and then began to gain leaving the game winner to a somewhat formidable sum the same night his employer s safe was robbed a search was had the winnings of lorison were found in his room their total forming an accusative nearness to the sum purloined he was taken tried and through incomplete evidence released smutched with the sinister devoirs of a dis agreeing jury it is not in the unjust accusation he said to the girl that my burden lies but in the knowledge that from the moment i staked the first dollar of the firm s money i was a criminal no matter whether i lost or won you see why it is impossible for me to speak of love to her it is a sad thing said norah after a little pause to think what very good people there are in the world good said lorison i was thinking of this superior person whom you say you love she must be a very poor sort of creature i do not understand nearly she continued as poor a sort of creature as yourself you do not understand said lorison removing his hat and sweeping back his fine light hair suppose she loved me in return and were willing to marry me think if you can what would follow never a day would pass but she would be reminded of her sacrifice i would read a condescension in her smile a pity even in her affection that would madden me no the thing would stand between us forever only equals should mate i could never ask her to come down upon my lower plane an arc light faintly shone upon lorison s face an illumination from within also pervaded it the girl saw the rapt ascetic look it was the face either of sir galahad or sir fool quite starlike she said is this unapproachable angel really too high to be grasped by me yes she faced him suddenly my dear friend would you prefer your star fallen lorison made a wide gesture you push me to the bald fact he declared you are not in sympathy with my argument but i will answer you so if i could reach my particular star to drag it down i would not do it but if it were fallen i would pick it up and thank heaven for the privilege they were silent for some minutes norah shivered and thrust her hands deep into the pockets of her jacket lorison uttered a remorseful exclamation i m not cold she said i was just thinking i ought to tell you something you have selected a strange confidante but you cannot expect a chance acquain ance picked up in a doubtful restaurant to be an angel norah cried lorison let me go on you have told me about yourself we have been such good friends i must tell you now what i never wanted you to know i am worse than you are i was on the stage i sang in the chorus i was pretty bad i guess i stole diamonds from the prima donna they arrested me i gave most of them up and they let me go i drank wine every night a great deal i was very wicked but lorison knelt quickly by her side and took her hands dear norah he said exultantly it is you it is you i love you never guessed it did you tis you i meant all the time now i can speak let me make you forget the past we have both suffered let us shut out the world and live for each other norah do you hear me say i love you in spite of rather say because of it you have come out of your past noble and good your heart is an angel s give it to me a little while ago you feared the future too much to even speak but for you not for myself can you love me she cast herself wildly sobbing upon his breast better than life than truth itself than every thing and my own past said lorison with a note of solicitude can you forgive and i answered you that she whispered when i told you i loved you she leaned away and looked thought fully at him if i had not told you about myself would you have would you no he interrupted i would never have let you know i loved you i would never have asked you this norah will you be my wife she wept again oh believe me i am good now i am no longer wicked i will be the best wife in the world don t think i am bad any more if you do i shall die i shall die while he was consoling her she brightened up eager and impetuous will vou marry me to night she said will you prove it that way i have a reason for wishing it to be to night will you of one of two things was this exceeding frankness the outcome either of importunate brazenness or of utter innocence the lover s perspective contained only the one the sooner said lorison the happier i shall be what is there to do she asked what do you have to get come you should know her energy stirred the dreamer to action a city directory first he cried gayly to find where the man lives who gives licenses to happiness we will go together and rout him out cabs cars policemen telephones and ministers shall aid us father rogan shall marry us said the girl with ardour i will take you to him an hour later the two stood at the open doorway of an immense gloomy brick building in a narrow and lonely street the license was tight in norah s hand wait here a moment she said till i find father rogan she plunged into the black hallway and the lover was left standing as it were on one leg outside his impa tience was not greatly taxed gazing curiously into what seemed the hallway to erebus he was presently reassured by a stream of light that bisected the darkness far down the passage then he heard her call and fluttered lampward like the moth she beckoned him through a doorway into the room whence emanated the light the room was bare of nearly everything except books which had subjugated all its space here and there little spots of territory had been reconquered an elderly bald man with a superlatively calm remote eye stood by a table with a book in his hand his finger still marking a page his dress was sombre and appertained to a religious order his eye denoted an acquaintance with the perspective father rogan said norah this is he the two of ye said father rogan want to get married they did not deny it he married them the cere mony was quickly done one who could have witnessed it and felt its scope might have trembled at the terrible inadequacy of it to rise to the dignity of its endless chain of results afterward the priest spake briefly as if by rote of certain other civil and legal addenda that either might or should at a later time cap the ceremony lorison tendered a fee which was declined and before the door closed after the departing couple father rogan s book popped open again where his finger marked it in the dark hall norah whirled and clung to her com panion tearful will you never never be sorry at last she was reassured at the first light they reached upon the street she asked the time just as she had each night lorison looked at his watch half past eight lorison thought it was from habit that she guided their steps toward the corner where they always parted but arrived there she hesitated and then released his arm a drug store stood on the corner its bright soft light shone upon them please leave me here as usual to night said norah sweetly i must i would rather you would you will not object at six to morrow evening i will meet you at antonio s i want to sit with vou there once more and then i will go where you say she gave him a bewildering bright smile and walked swiftly away surely it needed all the strength of her charm to carry off this astounding behaviour it was no discredit to lorison s strength of mind that his head began to whirl pocketing his hands he rambled vacuously over to the druggist s windows and began assiduously to spell over the names of the patent medicines therein displayed as soon as be had recovered his wits he proceeded along the street in an aimless fashion after drifting for two or three squares he flowed into a somewhat more pretentious thoroughfare a way much frequented by him in his solitary ramblings for here was a row of slops devoted to traffic in goods of the widest range of choice handiworks of art skill and fancy products of nature and labour from every zone here for a time he loitered among the conspicuous windows where was set emphasized bv congested floods of light the cunningest spoil of the interiors there were few passers and of this lorison was glad he was not of the world for a long time he had touched his fellow man only at the gear of a levelled cog wheel at right angles and upon a different axis he had dropped into a distinctly new orbit the stroke of ill fortune had acted upon him in effect as a blow delivered upon the apex of a certain ingenious toy the musical top which when thus buffeted while spinning gives forth with scarcely retarded motion a complete change of key and chord strolling along the pacific avenue he experienced singular supernatural calm accompanied by an unusual a activity of brain reflecting upon recent affairs be assured himself of his happiness in having won for a bride the one he had so greatly desired yet he wondered mildly at his dearth of active emotion her strange behaviour in abandoning him without valid excuse on his bridal eve aroused in him only a vague and curious speculation again he found himself contemplating with complaisant serenity the incidents of her somewhat lively career his perspective seemed to have been queerly shifted as he stood before a window near a corner his ears were assailed by a waxing clamour and commotion he stood close to the window to allow passage to the cause of the hubbub a procession of human beings which rounded the corner aid headed in his direction he perceived a salient hue of blue and a glitter of brass about a central figure of dazzling white and silver and a ragged wake of black bobbing figures two ponderous policemen were conducting between them a woman dressed as if for the stage in a short white satiny skirt reaching to the knees pink stockings and a sort of sleeveless bodice bright with relucent armour like scales upon her curly light hair was perched at a rollicking angle a shining tin helmet the costume was to be instantly recognized as one of those amazing con ceptions to which competition has harried the inventors of the spectacular ballet one of the officers bore a long cloak upon his axm which doubtless had been intended to veil the i candid attractions of their effulgent prisoner but for some reason it had not been called into use to the vociferous delight of the tail of the procession compelled by a sudden and vigorous movement of the woman the parade halted before the window by which lorison stood he saw that she was young and at the first glance was deceived by a sophistical prettiness of her face which waned before a more judicious scrutiny her look was bold and reckless and upon her countenance where yet the contours of youth survived were the finger marks of old age s credentialed courier late hours the young woman fixed her unshrinking gaze upon lorison and called to him in the voice of the wronged heroine in straits say you look like a good fellow come and put up the bail won t you i ve done nothing to get pinched for it s all a mistake see how they re treating me you won t be sorry if you ll help me out of this think of your sister or your girl being dragged along the streets this way i say come along now like a good fellow it may be that lorison in spite of the unconvincing bathos of this appeal showed a sympathetic face for one of the officers left the woman s side and went over to him it s all right sir he said in a husky confidential tone she s the right party we took her after the first act at the green light theatre on a wire from the chief of police of chicago it s only a square or two to the station her rig s pretty bad but she refused to change clothes or rather added the officer with a smile to put on some i thought i d explain matters to you so you wouldn t think she was being imposed upon what is the charge asked lorison grand larceny diamonds her husband is a jeweller in chicago she cleaned his show case of the sparklers and skipped with a comic opera troupe the policeman perceiving that the interest of the entire group of spectators was centred upon himself and lorison their conference being regarded as a possible new com plication was fain to prolong the situation which reflected his own importance by a little afterpiece of philosophical comment a gentleman like you sir he went on affably would never notice it but it comes in my line to observe what an immense amount of trouble is made by that com bination i mean the stage diamonds and light headed women who aren t satisfied with good homes i tell you sir a man these days and nights wants to know what his women folks are up to the policeman smiled a good night and returned to the side of his charge who had been intently watching lorison s face during the conversation no doubt for some indication of his intention to render succour now at the failure of the sign and at the movement made to continue the ignominious progress she abandoned hope and addressed him thus pointedly you damn chalk faced quitter you was thinking of giving me a hand but you let the cop talk you out of it the first word you re a dandy to tie to say if you ever get a girl she ll have a picnic won t she work you to the queen s taste oh my she concluded with a taunting shrill laugh that rasped lorison like a saw the policemen urged her forward the delighted train of gaping followers closed up the rear and the captive amazon accepting her fate extended the scope of her maledictions so that none in hearing might seem to be slighted then there came upon lorison an overwhelming revulsion of his perspective it may be that he had been ripe for it that the abnormal condition of mind in which he had for so long existed was already about to revert to its balance however it is certain that the events of the last few minutes had furnished the channel if not the impetus for the change the initial determining influence had been so small a thing as the fact and manner of his having been approached by the officer that agent had by the style of his accost restored the loiterer to his former place in society in an instant he had been transformed from a somewhat rancid prowler along the fishy side streets of gentility into an honest gentleman with whom even so lordly a guardian of the peace might agreeably exchange the compliments this then first broke the spell and set thrilling in him a resurrected longing for the fellowship of his kind and the rewards of the virtuous to what end he vehemently asked himself was this fanciful self accusation this empty renunciation this moral squeamishness through which he had been led to abandon what was his heritage in life and not beyond his deserts technically he was uncondemned his sole guilty spot was in thought rather than deed and cognizance of it unshared by others for what good moral or sentimental did he slink retreating like the hedgehog from his own shadow to and fro in this musty bohemia that lacked even the picturesque but the thing that struck home and set him raging was the part played by the amazonian prisoner to the counterpart of that astounding belligerent identical at least in the way of experience to one by her own confession thus far fallen had he not three hours since been united in marriage how desirable and natural it had seemed to him then and how monstrous it seemed now how the words of diamond thief number two yet burned in his ears if you ever get a cirl she ll have a picnic what did that that this women instinc tively knew him for one they could hoodwink still again there reverberated the policeman s sapient contribution to his agony a man these days and nights wants to know what his women folks are up to oh yes he had been a fool he had looked at things from the wrong standpoint but the wildest note in all the clamour was struck by pain s forefinger jealousy now at least he felt that keenest sting a mounting love unworthily bestowed whatever she might be he loved her he bore in his own breast his doom a grating comic flavour to his pre dicament struck him suddenly and he laughed creakingly as he swung down the echoing pavement an impetuous desire to act to battle with his fate seized him he stopped upon his heel and smote his palms together triumphantly his wife was where but there was a tangible link an outlet more or less navigable through which his derelict ship of matrimony might yet be safely towed the priest like all imaginative men with pliable natures lorison was when thoroughly stirred apt to become tempest uous with a high and stubborn indignation upon him be retraced his steps to the intersecting street by which he had come down this he hurried to the corner where he had parted with an astringent grimace tinctured the thought his wife thence still back he harked follow ing through an unfamiliar district his stimulated recollec tions of the way they had come from that preposterous wedding many times he went abroad and nosed his way back to the trail furious at last when he reached the dark calamitous building in which his madness had culminated and found the black hallway he dashed down it perceiving no light or sound but he raised his voice hailing loudly reckless of everything but that he should find the old mischief maker with the eyes that looked too far awav to see the disaster he had wrought the door opened and in the stream of light father rogan stood his book in hand with his finger marking the place ah cried lorison you are the man i want i had a wife of you a few hours ago i would not trouble you but i neglected to note how it was done will you oblige me with the information whether the business is beyond remedy come inside said the priest there are other lodgers in the house who might prefer sleep to even a gratified curiosity lorison entered the room and took the chair offered him the priest s eyes looked a courteous interrogation i must apologize again said the young man for so soon intruding upon you with my marital infelicities but as my wife has neglected to furnish me with her address i am deprived of the legitimate recourse of a family row i am quite a plain man said father rogan pleas antly but i do not see how i am to ask you questions pardon my indirectness said lorison i will ask one in this room to night you pronounced me to be a husband you afterward spoke of additional rites or performances that either should or could be effected i paid little attention to your words then but i am hungry to hear them repeated now as matters stand am i married past all help you are as legally and as firmly bound said the priest as though it had been done in a cathedral in the presence of thousands the additional observances i referred to are not necessary to the strictest legality of the act but were advised as a precaution for the future for convenience of proof in such contingencies as wills inheritances and the like lorison laughed harshly many thanks he said then there is no mistake and i am the happy benedict i suppose i should go stand upon the bridal corner and when my wife gets through walking the streets she will look me up father rogan regarded him calmly my son he said when a man and woman come to me to be married i always marry them i do this for the sake of other people whom they might go away and marry if they did not marry each other as you see i do not seek your confidence but your case seems to me to be one not altogether devoid of interest very few marriages that have come to my notice have brought such well expressed regret within so short a time i will hazard one question were you not under the impression that you loved the lady you married at the time you did so loved her cried lorison wildly never so well as now though she told me she deceived and sinned and stole never more than now when perhaps she is laughing at the fool she cajoled and left with scarcely a word to return to god only knows what particular line of her former folly father rooan answered nothing during the silence that succeeded he sat with a quiet expectation beaming in his full lambent eye if you would listen began lorison the priest held up his hand as i hoped he said i thought you would trust me wait but a moment he brought a long clay pipe filled and lighted it now my son he said lorison poured a twelve month s accumulated con fidence into father rogan s ear he told all not sparing himself or omitting the facts of his past the events of the night or his disturbing conjectures and fears the main point said the priest when he had con cluded seems to me to be this are you reasonably sure that you love this woman whom you have married why exclaimed lorisoii rising impulsively to his feet why should i deny it but look at me am fish flesh or fowl that is the main point to me assure you i understand you said the priest also risino and laying down his pipe the situation is one that has taxed the endurance of much older men than you in fact especially much older men than you i will try to relieve you from it and this night you shall see for yourself into exactly what predicament you have fallen and how you shall possibly be extricated there is no evidence so credible as that of the eyesight father rogan moved about the room and donned a soft black hat buttoning his coat to his throat he laid his hand on the doorknob let us walk he said the two went out upon the street the priest turned his face down it and lorison walked with him through a squalid district where the houses loomed awry and desoiate looking high above them presently they turned into a less dismal side street where the houses were smaller and though hinting of the most meagre comfort lacked the concentrated wretchedness of the more populous byways at a segregated two story house father rogan halted and mounted the steps with the confidence of a familiar visitor he ushered lorison into a narrow hallway faintly lighted by a cobwebbed hanging lamp almost immediately a door to the right opened and a dingy irish woman protruded her head good evening to ye mistress geehan said the priest unconsciously it seemed falling into a delicately flavoured brogue and is it yourself can tell me if norah has gone out again the night maybe oh it s yer blissid reverence sure and i can tell ye the same the purty darlin wint out as usual but a bit later and she says mother geehan says she it s me last noight out praise the saints this noight is and oh yer reverence the swate beautiful drame of a dress she had this toime white satin and silk and ribbons and lace about the neck and arrums twas a sin yer reverence the gold was spint upon it the priest heard lorison catch his breath painfully and a faint smile flickered across his own clean cut mouth well then mistress geehan said he i ll just step upstairs and see the bit boy for a minute and i ll take this gentleman up with me he s awake thin said the woman i ve just come down from sitting wid him the last hour tilling him fine shtories of ould county tyrone tis a greedy gos soon it is yer riverence for me shtories small the doubt said father rogan there s no rocking would put him to slape the quicker i m thinking amid the woman s shrill protest against the retort the two men ascended the steep stairway the priest pushed open the door of a room near its top is that you already sister drawled a sweet childish voice from the darkness it s only ould father denny come to see ye darlin and a foine gentleman i ve brought to make ye a gr r and call and ye resaves us fast aslape in bed shame on yez manners oh father denny is that you i m glad and will you light the lamp please it s on the table by the door and quit talking like mother geehan father denny the priest lit the lamp and lorison saw a tiny towsled haired boy with a thin delicate face sitting up in a small bed in a corner quickly also his rapid glance con sidered the room and its contents it was furnished with more than comfort and its adornments plainly indicated a woman s discerning taste an open door beyond revealed the blackness of an adjoining room s interior the boy clutched both of father rogan s hands i m so glad you came he said but why did you come in the night did sister send you off wid ye am i to be sint about at me age as was terence mcshane of ballymahone i come on me own r r responsibility lorison had also advanced to the boy s bedside he was fond of children and the wee fellow laving himself down to sleep alone ill that dark room stirred his heart aren t you afraid little man he asked stooping down beside him sometimes answered the boy with a shy smile when the rats make too much noise but nearly every night when sister goes out molt her geehan stays a while with me and tells me funny stories i m not often afraid sir this brave little gentleman said father rogan is a scholar of mine every day from half past six to half past eight when sister comes for him he stops in my study and we find out what s in the inside of books he knows multiplication division and fractions and he s troubling me to begin wid the chronicles of ciaran of clonmaciioise corurac mccullenan and cuan o loc hain the gr r reat irish histhorians the boy was evidently accustomed to the priest s celtic pleasantries a little appreciative grin was all the attention the insin nation of pedantry received lorison to have saved his life could not have put to the child one of those vital questions that were wildly beating about unanswered in his own brain the little fellow was very like norah he had the same shining hair and candid eyes oh father denny cried the boy suddenly i forgot to tell you sister is not going away at night any more she told me so when she kissed me good night as she was leaving and she said she was so happy and then she cried wasn t that queer but i m glad aren t you yes lad and now ye omadhaun go to sleep and say good night we must be going which shall i do first father denny faith he s caught me again wait till i get the sassenach into the annals of tageruach the hagiographer i ll give him enough of the irish idiom to make him more respectful the light was out and the small brave voice bidding them good night from the dark room they groped downstairs and tore away from the garrulity of mother geehan again the priest steered them through the dim ways but this time in another direction his conductor was serenely silent and lorison followed his example to the extent of seldom speaking serene he could not be his heart beat suffocatingly in his breast the following of this blind menacing trail was pregnant with he knew not what humiliating revelation to be delivered at its end they came into a more pretentious street where trade it could be surmised flourished by day and again the priest paused this time before a lofty building whose great doors and windows in the lowest floor were carefully shuttered and barred its higher apertures were dark save in the third story the windows of which were bril liantly lighted lorison s ear caught a distant regular pleasing thrumming as of music above they stood at an angle of the building up along the side nearest them mounted an iron stairway at its top was an upright illuminated parallelogram father rogan had stopped and stood musing i will say this much he remarked thoughtfully i believe you to be a better man than you think yourself to be and a better man than i thought some hours ago but do not take this he added with a smile as much praise i promised you a possible deliverance from an unhappy perplexity i will have to modify that promise i can only remove the mystery that enhanced that per plexity your deliverance depends upon yourself come he led his companion up the stairway halfway up lorison caught him by the sleeve remember he gasped i love that woman you desired to know i go on the priest reached the landing at the top of the stairway lorison behind him saw that the illuminated space was the glass upper half of a door opening into the lighted room the rhythmic music increased as they neared it the stairs shook with the mellow vibrations lorison stopped breathing when he set foot upon the highest step for the priest stood aside and motioned him to look through the glass of the door his eye accustomed to the darkness met first a blind ing glare and then he made out the faces and forms of many people amid an extravagant display of splendid robings billowy laces brilliant hued finery ribbons silks and misty drapery and then he caught the mean ing of that jarring hum and he saw the tired pale happy face of his wife bending as were a score of others over her sewing machine toiling toiling here was the folly she pursued and the end of his quest but not his deliverance though even then remorse struck him his shamed soul fluttered once more before it retired to make room for the other and better one for to temper his thrill of joy the shine of the satin and the glimmer of ornaments recalled the disturbing figure of the bespangled amazon and the base duplicate histories it by the glare of footlights and stolen diamonds it is past the wisdom of him who only sets the scenes either to praise or blame the man but this time his love over came his scruples he took a quick step and reached out his hand for the doorknob father rogan was quicker to arrest it and draw him back you use my trust in you queerly said the priest sternly what are you about to do i am going to my wife said lorison let me pass listen said the priest holding him firmly by the arm i am about to put you in possession of a piece of knowledge of which thus far you have scarcely proved deserving i do not think you ever will but i will not dwell upon that you see in that room the woman you married working for a frugal living for herself and a generous comfort for an idolized brother this building belongs to the chief costumer of the city for months the advance orders for the coming mardi gras festivals have kept the work going day and night i myself secured employment here for norah she toils here each night from nine o clock until daylight and besides carries home with her some of the finer costumes requiring more delicate needlework and works there part of the day somehow you two have remained strangely ignorant of each other s lives are you convinced now that your wife is not walking the streets let me go to her cried lorison again struggling and beg her forgiveness sir said the priest do you owe me nothing be quiet it seems so often that heaven lets fall its choicest gifts into hands that must be taught to hold them listen again you forgot that repentant sin must not comprom ise but look up for redemption to the purest and best you went to her with the fine spun sophistry that peace could be found in a mutual guilt and she fearful of losing what her heart so craved thought it worth the price to buy it with a desperate pure beautiful lie i have known her since the day she was born she is as innocent and unsullied in life and deed as a holy saint in that lowly street where she dwells she first saw the light and she has lived there ever since spending her days in generous self sacrifice for others och ye spalpeen continued father rogan raising his finger in kindly anger at lorison what for i wonder could she be after making a fool of hersilf and shamin her swate soul with lies for the like of you sir said lorison trembling say what you please of me doubt it as you must i will yet prove my gratitude to you and my devotion to her but let me speak to her once now let me kneel for just one moment at her feet and tut tut said the priest how many acts of a love drama do you think an old bookworm like me capable of witnessing besides what kind of figures do we cut spying upon the mysteries of midnight millinery go to meet your wife to morrow as she ordered you and obey her thereafter and maybe some time i shall get forgive ness for the part i have played in this night s work off wid yez down the shtairs now tis late and an ould man like me should be takin his rest madame bo peep of the ranches aunt ellen said octavia cheerfully as she threw her black kid gloves carefully at the dignified persian cat on the window seat i m a pauper you are so extreme in your statements octavia dear said aunt ellen mildly looking up from her paper if you find yourself temporarily in need of some small change for bonbons you will find my purse in the drawer of the writing desk octavia beaupree removed her hat and seated herself on a footstool near her aunt s chair clasping her hands about her knees her slim and flexible figure clad in a modish mourning costume accommodated itself easily and gracefully to the trying position her bright and youthful face with its pair of sparkling life enamoured eyes tried to compose itself to the seriousness that the occasion seemed to demand you good auntie it isn t a case of bonbons it is abject staring unpicturesque poverty with ready made clothes gasolined gloves and probably one o clock dinners all waiting with the traditional wolf at the door i ve just come from my lawyer auntie and please ma am i ain t got nothink t all flowers lady buttonhole gentleman pencils sir three for five to help a poor widow do i do it nicely auntie or as a bread winner accomplishment were my lessons in elocution entirely wasted do be serious my dear said aunt ellen letting her paper fall to the floor long enough to tell me what you mean colonel beaupree s estate colonel beaupree s estate interrupted octavia emphasizing her words with appropriate dramatic ges tures is of spanish castellar architecture colonel beaupree s resources are wind colonel beaupree s stocks are water colonel beaupree s income is all in the statement lacks the legal technicalities to which i have been listening for an hour but that is what it means when translated octavia aunt ellen was now visibly possessed by consternation i can hardly believe it and it was the impression that he was worth a million and the de peysters themselves introduced him octavia rippled out a laugh and then became properly grave de mortuis nil auntie not even the rest of it the dear old colonel what a gold brick he was after all i paid for my bargain fairly i m all here am i not items eyes fingers toes youth old family unques tionable position in society as called for in the contract no wild cat stock here octavia picked up the morning paper from the floor but i m not going to squeal isn t that what they call it when you rail at fortune because you ve lost the game she turned the pages of the paper calmly stock market no use for that society s doings that s done here is my page the wish column a van dresser could not be said to want for anything of course chamber maids cooks canvassers stenographers dear said aunt ellen with a little tremor in her voice please do not talk in that way even if your affairs are in so unfortunate a condition there is my three thousand octavia sprang up lithely and deposited a smart kiss on the delicate cheek of the prim little elderly maid blessed auntie your three thousand is just sufficient to insure your hyson to be free from willow leaves and keep the persian in sterilized cream i know i d be welcome but i prefer to strike bottom like beelzebub rather than hang around like the peri listening to the music from the side entrance i m going to earn my own living there s nothing else to do i m a oh oh oh i had forgotten there s one thing saved from the wreck it s a corral no a ranch in let me see texas an asset dear old mr bannister called it how pleased he was to show me something he could describe as unencumbered i ve a description of it among those stupid papers he made me bring away with me from his office i ll try to find it octavia found her shopping bag and drew from it a long envelope filled with typewritten documents a ranch in texas sighed aunt ellen it sounds to me more like a liability than an asset those are the places where the centipedes are found and cowboys and fandangos the rancho de las sombras read octavia from a sheet of violently purple typewriting is situated one hundred and ten miles southeast of san antonio and thirty eight miles from its nearest railroad station nopal on the i and g n ranch consists of acres of well watered land with title conferred by state patents and twenty two sections or acres partly under yearly running lease and partly bought under state s twenty year purchase act eight thousand graded merino sheep with the necessary equipment of horses vehicles and general ranch paraphernalia ranch house built of brick with six rooms comfortably furnished according to the requirements of the climate all within a strong barbed wire fence the present ranch manager seems to be competent and reliable and is rapidly placing upon a paying basis a business that in other hands had been allowed to suffer from neglect and misconduct this property was secured by colonel beaupree in a deal with a western irrigation syndicate and the title to it seems to be perfect with careful management and the natural increase of land values it ought to be made the foundation for a comfortable fortune for its owner when octavia ceased reading aunt ellen uttered something as near a sniff as her breeding permitted the prospectus she said with uncompromising metropolitan suspicion doesn t mention the centipedes or the indians and you never did like mutton octavia i don t see what advantage you can derive from this desert but octavia was in a trance her eyes were steadily regarding something quite beyond their focus her lips were parted and her face was lighted by the kindling furor of the explorer the ardent stirring disquiet of the adventurer suddenly she clasped her hands together exultantly the problem solves itself auntie she cried i m going to that ranch i m going to live on it i m going to learn to like mutton and even concede the good qualities of centipedes at a respectful distance it s just what i need it s a new life that comes when my old one is just ending it s a release auntie it isn t a narrow ing think of the gallops over those leagues of prairies with the wind tugging at the roots of your hair the com ing close to the earth and learning over again the stories of the growing grass and the little wild flowers without names glorious is what it will be shall i be a shepherdess with a watteau hat and a crook to keep the bad wolves from the lambs or a typical western ranch girl with short hair like the pictures of her in the sunday papers i think the latter and they ll have my picture too with the wild cats i ve slain single handed hanging from my saddle horn from the four hundred to the flocks is the way they ll headline it and they ll print photographs of the old van dresser mansion and the church where i was married they won t have my picture but they ll get an artist to draw it i ll be wild and woolly and i ll grow my own wool octavia aunt ellen condensed into the one word all the protests she was unable to utter don t say a word auntie i m going i ll see the sky at night fit down on the world like a big butter dish cover and i ll make friends again with the stars that i haven t had a chat with since i was a wee child i wish to go i m tired of all this i m glad i haven t any money i could bless colonel beaupree for that ranch and forgive him for all his bubbles what if the life will be rough and lonely i i deserve it i shut my heart to everything except that miserable ambition i oh i wish to go away and forget forget octavia swerved suddenly to her knees laid her flushed face in her aunt s lap and shook with turbulent sobs aunt ellen bent over her and smoothed the coppery brown hair i didn t know she said gently i didn t know that who was it dear when mrs octavia beaupree n e van dresser stepped from the train at nopal her manner lost for the moment some of that easy certitude which had always marked her movements the town was of recent estab lishment and seemed to have been hastily constructed of undressed lumber and flapping canvas the element that had congregated about the station though not offensively demonstrative was clearly composed of citizens accustomed to and prepared for rude alarms octavia stood on the platform against the telegraph office and attempted to choose by intuition from the swaggering straggling string of loungers the manager of the rancho de las sombras who had been instructed by mr bannister to meet her there that tall serious looking elderly man in the blue flannel shirt and white tie she thought must be he but no he passed by removing his gaze from the lady as hers rested on him according to the southern custom the manager she thought with some impatience at being kept waiting should have no difficulty in selecting her young women wearing the most recent thing in ash coloured travelling suits were not so plentiful in nopal thus keeping a speculative watch on all persons of possible managerial aspect octavia with a catching breath and a start of surprise suddenly became aware of teddy westlake hurrying along the platform in the direction of the train of teddy westlake or his sun browned ghost in cheviot boots and leather girdled hat theodore westlake jr amateur polo almost champion all round butterfly and cumberer of the soil but a broader surer more emphasized and determined teddy than the one she had known a year ago when last she saw him he perceived octavia at almost the same time deflected his course and steered for her in his old straightforward way something like awe came upon her as the strange ness of his metamorphosis was brought into closer range the rich red brown of his complexion brought out so vividly his straw coloured mustache and steel gray eyes he seemed more grown up and somehow farther away but when he spoke the old boyish teddy came back again they had been friends from childhood why tave he exclaimed unable to reduce his perplexity to coherence how what when where train said octavia necessity ten minutes ago home your complexion s gone teddy now how what when where i m working down here said teddy he cast side glances about the station as one does who tries to combine politeness with duty you didn t notice on the train he asked an old lady with gray curls and a poodle who occupied two seats with her bundles and quarrelled with the conductor did you i think not answered octavia reflecting and you haven t by any chance noticed a big gray mustached man in a blue shirt and six shooters with little flakes of merino wool sticking in his hair have you lots of em said teddy with symptoms of mental delirium under the strain do you happen to know any such individual no the description is imaginary is your interest in the old lady whom you describe a personal one never saw her in my life she s painted entirely from fancy she owns the little piece of property where i earn my bread and butter the rancho de las sombras i drove up to meet her according to arrangement with her lawyer octavia leaned against the wall of the telegraph office was this possible and didn t he know are you the manager of that ranch she asked weakly i am said teddy with pride i am mrs beaupree said octavia faintly but my hair never would curl and i was polite to the conductor for a moment that strange grown up look came back and removed teddy miles away from her i hope you ll excuse me he said rather awkwardly you see i ve been down here in the chaparral a year i hadn t heard give me your checks please and i ll have your traps loaded into the wagon jos will follow with them we travel ahead in the buckboard seated by teddy in a feather weight buckboard behind a pair of wild cream coloured spanish ponies octavia abandoned all thought for the exhilaration of the present they swept out of the little town and down the level road toward the south soon the road dwindled and dis appeared and they struck across a world carpeted with an endless reach of curly mesquite grass the wheels made no sound the tireless ponies bounded ahead at an unbroken gallop the temperate wind made fragrant by thousands of acres of blue and yellow wild flowers roared gloriously in their ears the motion was a rial ecstatic with a thrilling sense of perpetuity in its effect octavia sat silent possessed by a feeling of elemental sensual bliss teddy seemed to be wrestling with some internal problem i m going to call you madama he announced as the result of his labours that is what the mexicans will call you they re nearly all mexicans on the ranch you know that seems to me about the proper thing very well mr westlake said octavia primly oh now said teddy in some consternation that s carrying the thing too far isn t it don t worry me with your beastly etiquette i m just beginning to live don t remind me of anything artificial if only this air could be bottled this much alone is worth coming for oh look i there goes a deer jack rabbit said teddy without turning his head could i might i drive suggested octavia pant ing with rose tinted cheeks and the eye of an eager child on one condition could i might i smoke forever cried octavia taking the lines with solemn joy how shall i know which way to drive keep her sou by sou east and all sail set you see that black speck on the horizon under that lowermost gulf cloud that s a group of live oaks and a land mark steer halfway between that and the little hill to the left i ll recite you the whole code of driving rules for the texas prairies keep the reins from under the horses feet and swear at em frequent i m too happy to swear ted oh why do people buy yachts or travel in palace cars when a buckboard and a pair of plugs and a spring morning like this can satisfy all desire now i ll ask you protested teddy who was futilely striking match after match on the dashboard not to call those denizens of the air plugs they can kick out a hundred miles between daylight and dark at last he succeeded in snatching a light for his cigar from the flame held in the hollow of his hands room said octavia intensely that s what produces the effect i know now what i ve wanted scope range room smoking room said teddy unsentimentally i love to smoke in a buckboard the wind blows the smoke into you and out again it saves exertion the two fell so naturally into their old time goodfellow ship that it was only by degrees that a sense of the strange ness of the new relations between them came to be felt madama said teddy wonderingly however did you get it into your bead to cut the crowd and come down here is it a fad now among the upper classes to trot off to sheep ranches instead of to newport i was broke teddy said octavia sweetly with her interest centred upon steering safely between a spanish dagger plant and a clump of chaparral i haven t a thing in the world but this ranch not even any other home to go to come now said teddy anxiously but ineredu lously you don t mean it when my husband said octavia with a shy slurring of the word died three months ago i thought i had a reasonable amount of the world s goods his lawyer exploded that theory in a sixty minute fully illustrated lecture i took to the sheep as a last resort do you happen to know of any fashionable caprice among the gilded youth of manhattan that induces them to abandon polo and club windows to become managers of sheep ranches it s easily explained in my case responded teddy promptly i had to go to work i couldn t have earned my board in new york so i chummed a while with old sandford one of the syndicate that owned the ranch before colonel beaupree bought it and got a place down here i wasn t manager at first i jogged around on ponies and studied the business in detail until i got all the points in my head i saw where it was losing and what the reme dies were and then sandford put me in charge i get a hundred dollars a month and i earn it poor teddy said octavia with a smile you needn t i like it i save half my wages and i m as hard as a water plug it beats polo will it furnish bread and tea and jam for another out cast from civilization the spring shearing said the manager just cleaned up a deficit in last year s business wastefulness and inattention have been the rule heretofore the autumn clip will leave a small profit over all expenses next year there will be jam when about four o clock in the afternoon the ponies rounded a gentle brush covered hill and then swooped like a double cream coloured cyclone upon the rancho de las sombras octavia gave a little cry of delight a lordly grove of magnificent live oaks cast an area of grateful cool shade whence the ranch had drawn its name de las sombras of the shadows the house of red brick one story ran low and long beneath the trees through its middle dividing its six rooms in half extended a broad arched passageway picturesque with flowering cactus and hanging red earthern jars a gallery low and broad encircled the building vines climbed about it and the adjacent ground was for a space covered with transplanted grass and shrubs a little lake long and narrow glimmered in the sun at the rear further away stood the shacks of the mexican workers the corrals wool sheds and shearing pens to the right lay the low hills splattered with dark patches of chaparral to the left the unbounded green prairie blending against the blue heavens it s a home teddy said octavia breathlessly that s what it is it s a home not so bad for a sheep ranch admitted teddy with excusable pride i ve been tinkering on it at odd times a mexican youth sprang from somewhere in the grass and took charge of the creams the mistress and the manager entered the house here s mrs macintyre said teddy as a placid neat elderly lady came out upon the gallery to meet them mrs mac here s the boss very likely she will be wanting a hunk of ham and a dish of beans after her drive mrs macintyre the housekeeper as much a fixture on the place as the lake or the live oaks received the imputation of the ranch s resources of refreshment with mild indignation and was about to give it utterance when octavia spoke oh mrs macintyre don t apologize for teddy yes i call him teddy so does every one whom he hasn t duped into taking him seriously you see we used to cut paper dolls and play jackstraws together ages ago no one minds what he says no said teddy no one minds what he says just so he doesn t do it again octavia cast one of those subtle sidelong glances toward him from beneath her lowered eyelids a glance that teddy used to describe as an upper cut but there was nothing in his ingenuous weather tanned face to warrant a suspicion that he was making an allusion nothing beyond a doubt thought octavia he had forgotten mr westlake likes his fun said mrs maclntyre as she conducted octavia to her rooms but she added loyally people around here usually pay attention to what he says when he talks in earnest i don t know what would have become of this place without him two rooms at the east end of the house had been arranged for the occupancy of the ranch s mistress when she entered them a slight dismay seized her at their bare appearance and the scantiness of their furniture but she quickly reflected that the climate was a semi tropical one and was moved to appreciation of the well conceived efforts to conform to it the sashes had already been removed from the big windows and white curtains waved in the gulf breeze that streamed through the wide jalousies the bare floor was amply strewn with cool rugs the chairs were inviting deep dreamy willows the walls were papered with a light cheerful olive one whole side of her sitting room was covered with books on smooth unpainted pine shelves she flew to these at once before her was a well selected library she caught glimpses of titles of volumes of fiction and travel not yet seasoned from the dampness of the press presently recollecting that she was now in a wilderness given over to mutton centipedes and privations the incongruity of these luxuries struck her and with intuitive feminine suspicion she began turning to the fly leaves of volume after volume upon each one was inscribed in fluent characters the name of theodore westlake jr octavia fatigued

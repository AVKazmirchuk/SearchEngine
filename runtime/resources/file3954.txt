day they had their heads together over the house plans their joint capital would set up a business in fruit or woods that would yield a comfortable support good night my world would say mrs conant

gathered in the lower ports by the pajaro to be distributed at casual stopping places thus do the beneficent voyagers scatter news and enter tainment among the prisoners of sea and mountains tio pancho the hotel proprietor set his great silver rimmed aiteojos upon his nose and divided the papers into a number of smaller rolls a barefooted muchacho dashed in desiring the post of messenger bien venido said tio pancho this to se ora conant that to el doctor s s schlegel dios what a name to say that to se or davis one for don alberto these two for the casa de huespedes numero en la calle de las buenas gracias and say to them all muchacho that the pajaro sails for panama at three this afternoon if any have letters to send by the post let them come quickly that they may first pass through the correo mrs conant received her roll of newspapers at four o clock the boy was late in delivering them because he had been deflected from his duty by an iguana that crossed his path and to which he immediately gave chase but it made no hardship for she had no letters to send she was idling in a hammock in the patio of the house that she occupied half awake half happily dreaming of the paradise that she and merriam had created out of the wrecks of their pasts she was content now for the horizon of that shimmering sea to be the horizon of her life they had shut out the world and closed the door merriam was coming to her house at seven after his dinner at the hotel she would put on a white dress and an apricot coloured lace mantilla and they would walk an hour under the cocoanut palms by the lagoon she smiled contentedly and chose a paper at random from the roll the boy had brought at first the words of a certain headline of a sunday newspaper meant nothing to her they conveyed only a visualized sense of familiarity the largest type ran thus lloyd b conant secures divorce and then the subheadings well known saint louis paint manufacturer wins suit pleading one year s absence of wife her mysterious disappearance recalled nothing has been heard of her since twisting herself quickly out of the hammock mrs conant s eye soon traversed the half column of the recall it ended thus it will be remembered that mrs conant disappeared one evening in march of last year it was freely rumoured that her marriage with lloyd b conant resulted in much unhappiness stories were not wanting to the effect that his cruelty toward his wife had more than once taken the form of physical abuse after her departure a full bottle of tincture of aconite a deadly poison was found in a small medicine cabinet in her bedroom this might have been an indication that she meditated suicide it is supposed abandoned such an intention if she possessed it and left her home instead mrs conant slowly dropped the paper and sat on a chair clasping her hands tightly let me think o god let me think she whis pered i took the bottle with me i threw it out of the window of the train i there was another bottle in the cabinet there were two side by side the aconite and the valerian that i took when i could not sleep if they found the aconite bottle full why but he is alive of course i gave him only a harmless dose of valerian i am not a murderess in fact ralph i god don t let this be a dream she went into the part of the house that she rented from the old peruvian man and his wife shut the door and walked up and down her room swiftly and feverishly for half an hour merriam s photograph stood in a frame on a table she picked it up looked at it with a smile of exquisite tenderness and dropped four tears on it and merriam only twenty rods away then she stood still for ten minutes looking into space she looked into space through a slowly opening door on her side of the door was the building material for a castle of romance love an arcady of waving palms a lullaby of waves on the shore of a haven of rest respite peace a lotus land of dreamy ease and security a life of poetry and heart s ease and refuge romanticist will you tell me what mrs conant saw on the other side of the door you cannot that is you will not very well then listen she saw herself go into a department store and buy five spools of silk thread and three yards of gingham to make an apron for the cook shall i charge it ma am asked the clerk as she walked out a lady whom she met greeted her cordially oh where did you get the pattern for those sleeves dear mrs conant she said at the corner a policeman helped her across the street and touched his helmet any callers she asked the maid when she reached home mrs waldron answered the maid and the tqvo misses jenkinson very well she said you may bring me a cup of tea maggie mrs conant went to the door and called angela the old peruvian woman if mateo is there send him to me mateo a half breed shuffling and old but efficient came is there a steamer or a vessel of any kind leaving this coast to night or to morrow that i can get passage on she asked mateo considered at punta reina thirty miles down the coast se ora he answered there is a small steamer loading with cinchona and dyewoods she sails for san francisco to morrow at sunrise so says my brother who arrived in his sloop to day passing by punta reina you must take me in that sloop to that steamer to night will you do that perhaps mateo shrugged a suggestive shoul der mrs conant took a handful of money from a drawer and gave it to him get the sloop ready behind the little point of land below the town she ordered get sailors and be ready to sail at six o clock in half an hour bring a cart partly filled with straw into the patio here and take my trunk to the sloop there is more money yet now hurry for one time mateo walked away without shuffling his feet angela cried mrs conant almost fiercely come and help me pack i am going away out with this trunk my clothes first stir yourself those dark dresses first hurry from the first she did not waver from her decision her view was clear and final her door had opened and let the world in her love for merriam was not lessened but it now appeared a hopeless and unrealizable thing the visions of their future that had seemed so blissful and complete had vanished she tried to assure herself that her renunciation was rather for his sake than for her own now that she was cleared of her burden at least technically would not his own weigh too heavily upon him if she should cling to him would not the difference forever silently mar and corrode their happiness thus she reasoned but there were a thousand little voices calling to her that she could feel rather than hear like the hum of distant powerful machinery the little voices of the world that when raised in unison can send their insistent call through the thickest door once while packing a brief shadow of the lotus dream came back to her she held merriam s picture to her heart with one hand while she threw a pair of shoes into the trunk with her other at six o clock mateo returned and reported the sloop ready he and his brother lifted the trunk into the cart covered it with straw and conveyed it to the point of embarkation from there they transferred it on board in the sloop s dory then mateo returned for additional orders mrs conant was ready she had settled all business matters with angela and was impatiently waiting she wore a long loose black silk duster that she often walked about in when the evenino s were chilly on her head was a small round hat and over it the apricot coloured lace mantilla dusk had quickly followed the short twilight mateo led her by dark and grass grown streets toward the point behind which the sloop was anchored on turning a corner they beheld the hotel orilla del mar three streets away nebulously aglow with its array of kerosene lamps mrs conant paused with streamin eyes i must i must see him once before i go she murmured in anguish but even then she did not falter in her decision quickly she invented a plan by which she might speak to him and yet make her departure without his knowing she would walk past the hotel ask some one to call him out and talk a few moments on some trivial excuse leaving him expecting to see her at her home at seven she unpinned her hat and gave it to mateo keep this and wait here till i come she ordered then she draped the mantilla over her head as she usually did when walking after sunset and went straight to the orilla del mar she was glad to see the bulky white clad figure of tio pancho standing alone on the gallery tio pancho she said with a charming smile may i trouble you to ask mr merriam to come out for just a few moments that i may speak with him tio pancho bowed as an elephant bows buenas tardes se ora conant he said as a cavalier talks and then he went on less at his ease but does not the se ora know that se or merriam sailed on the pajaro for panama at three o clock of this afternoon the theory and the hound not many days ago my old friend from the tropics j p bridger united states consul on the island of ratona was in the city we had wassail and jubilee and saw the flatiron building and missed seeing the bronxless menagerie by about a couple of nights and then at the ebb tide we were walking up a street that parallels and parodies broadway a woman with a comely and mundane countenance passed us holding in leash a wheezing vicious waddling brute of a yellow pug the dog entangled himself with bridger s legs and mumbled his ankles in a snarling peevish sulky bite bridger with a happy smile kicked the breath out of the brute the woman showered us with a quick rain of well conceived adjectives that left us in no doubt as to our place in her opinion and we passed on ten yards farther an old woman with dis ordered white hair and her bankbook tucked well hidden beneath her tattered shawl begged bridger stopped and disinterred for her a quarter from his holiday waist coat on the next corner a quarter of a ton of well clothed man with a rice powdered fat white jowl stood holding the chain of a devil born bulldog whose forelegs were strangers by the length of a dachshund a little woman in a last season s hat confronted him and wept which was plainly all she could do while he cursed her in low sweet practised tones bridger smiled again strictly to himself and this time he took out a little memorandum book and made a note of it this he had no right to do without due explanation and i said so it s a new theory said bridger that i picked up down in ratona i ve been gathering support for it as i knock about the world isn t ripe for it yet but well i ll tell you and then you run your mind back along the people you ve known and see what you make of it and so i cornered bridger in a place where they have artificial palms and wine and he told me the story which is here in my words and on his responsibility one afternoon at three o clock on the island of ratona a boy raced alongthe beach screaming pajaro ahoy thus he made known the keenness of his hearing and the justice of his discrimination in pitch he who first heard and made oral proclamation con cerning the toot of an approaching steamer s whistle and correctly named the steamer was a small hero in ratona until the next steamer came wherefore there was rivalry among the barefoot youth of ratona and many fell victims to the softly blown conch shells of sloops which as they enter harbour sound surprisingly like a distant steamer s signal and some could name you the vessel when its call in your duller ears sounded no louder than the sigh of the wind through the branches of the cocoa nut palms but to day he who proclaimed the pajaro gained his honours ratona bent its ear to listen and soon the deep tongued blast grew louder and nearer and at length ratona saw above the line of palms on the low joint the two black funnels of the fruiter slowly creeping toward the mouth of the harbour you must know that ratona is an island twenty miles off the south of a south american republic it is a port of that republic and it sleeps sweetly in a smiling sea toiling not nor spinning fed by the abundant tropics where all things ripen cease and fall toward the grave eight hundred people dream life away in a green embowered village that follows the horseshoe curve of its bijou harbour they are mostly spanish and indian mestizos with a shading of san domingo negroes a lightening of pure blood spanish officials and a slight leavening of the froth of three or four pioneering white races no steamers touch at ratona save the fruit steamers which take on their banana inspectors there on their way to the coast they leave sunday newspapers ice quinine bacon watermelons and vaccine matter at the island and that is about all the touch ratona gets with the world the pajaro paused at the mouth of the harbour roll ing heavily in the swell that sent the whitecaps racing beyond the smooth water inside already two dories from the village one conveying fruit inspectors the other going for what it could get were halfway out to the steamer the inspectors dory was taken on board with them and the pajaro steamed away for the mainland for its load of fruit the other boat returned to ratona bearing a contri bution from the pajaro s store of ice the usual roll of newspapers and one passenger taylor plunkett sheriff of chatham county kentucky bridger the united states consul at ratona was clean ing his rifle in the official shanty under a bread fruit tree twenty yards from the water of the harbour the consul occupied a place somewhat near the tail of his political party s procession the music of the band wagon sounded very faintly to him in the distance the plums of office went to others bridger s share of the spoils the consulship at ratona was little more than a prune a dried prune from the boarding house department of the public crib but yearly was opulence in ratona besides bridger had contracted a passion for shooting alligators in the lagoons near his consulate and was not unhappy he looked up from a careful inspection of his rifle lock a broad man filling his doorway a broad noiseless slow moving man sunburned almost to the vandyke a man of forty five neatly clothed in homespun with scanty light hair a close clipped brown and gray beard and pale blue eyes expressing mildness implicity you are mr bridger the consul said the broad man they directed me here can you tell me what those big bunches of things like gourds are in those trees that look like feather dusters along the edge of the water take that chair said the consul reoiling his clean ing rag no the other one that bamboo thing won t hold you why they re cocoanuts green cocoanuts the shell of em is always a light green before they re ripe much obliged said the other man sitting down carefully i didn t quite like to tell the folks at home they were olives unless i was sure about it my name is plunkett i m sheriff of chatham county kentucky i ve got extradition papers in my pocket authorizing the arrest of a man on this island they ve been signed by the president of this country and they re in correct shape the man s name is wade williams he s in the cocoa nut raising business what he s wanted for is the murder of his wife two years ago where can i find him the consul squinted an eye and looked through his rifle barrel there s nobody on the island who calls himself wil liams he remarked didn t suppose there was said plunkett mildly he ll do by any other name besides myself said bridger there are only two americans on ratona bob reeves and henry morgan the man i want sells cocoanuts suggested plunkett you see that cocoanut walk extending up to the point said the consul waving his hand toward the open door that belongs to bob reeves henry morgan owns half the trees to loo ard on the island one month ago said the sheriff wade williams wrote a confidential letter to a man in chatham county telling him where he was and how he was getting along the letter was lost and the person that found it gave it away they sent me after him and i ve got the papers i reckon he s one of your cocoanut men for certain you ve got his picture of course said bridger it might be reeves or morgan but i d hate to think it they re both as fine fellows as you d meet in an all day auto ride no doubtfully answered plunkett there wasn t any picture of williams to be had and i never saw him myself i ve been sheriff only a year but i ve got a pretty accurate description of him about feet dark hair and eyes nose inclined to be roman heavy about the shoulders strong white teeth with none miss ing laughs a good deal talkative drinks considerably but never to intoxication looks you square in the eye when talking age thirty five which one of your men does that description fit the consul grinned broadly i ll tell you what you do he said laying down his rifle and slipping on his dingy black alpaca coat you come along mr plunkett and i ll take you up to see the boys if you can tell which one of em your descrip tion fits better than it does the other you have the advan tage of me bridger conducted the sheriff out and along the hard beach close to which the tiny houses of the village were distributed immediately back of the town rose sudden small thickly wooded hills up one of these by means of steps cut in the hard clay the consul led plunkett the very verge of an eminence was perched a two room wooden cottage with a thatched roof a carib woman was washing clothes outside the consul ushered the sheriff to the door of the room that over looked the harbour two men were in the room about to sit down in their shirt sleeves to a table spread for dinner they bore little resemblance one to the other in detail but the general description given by plunkett could have been justly applied to either in height colour of hair shape of nose build and manners each of them tallied with it they were fair types of jovial ready witted broad gauged americans who had gravitated together for com panionship in an alien land hello bridger they called in unison at sight of the consul come and have dinner with us and then they noticed plunkett at his heels and came forward with hospitable curiosity gentlemen said the consul his voice taking on unaccustomed formality this is mr plunkett mr plunkett mr reeves and mr morgan the cocoanut barons greeted the newcomer joyously reeves seemed about an inch taller than morgan but his laugh was not quite as loud morgan s eyes were deep brown reeves s were black reeves was the host and busied himself with fetching other chairs and calling to the carib woman for supplemental table ware it was explained that morgan lived in a bamboo shack to loo ard but that every day the two friends dined together plunkett stood still during the preparations looking about mildly with his pale blue eyes bridger looked apologetic and uneasy at length two other covers were laid and the company was assigned to places reeves and morgan stood side by side across the table from the visitors reeves nodded genially as a signal for all to seat themselves and then suddenly plunkett raised his hand with a gesture of authority he was looking straight between reeves and morgan wade williams he said quietly you are under arrest for murder reeves and morgan instantly exchanged a quick bright glance the quality of which was interrogation with a seasoning of surprise then simultaneously they turned to the speaker with a puzzled and frank depre cation in their gaze can t say that we understand you mr plunkett said morgan cheerfully did you say williams what s the joke bridgy asked reeves turning to the consul with a smile before bridger could answer plunkett spoke again i ll explain he said quietly one of you don t need any explanation but this is for the other one one of you is wade williams of chatham county kentucky you murdered your wife on may two years ago after ill treating and abusing her continually for five years i have the proper papers in my pocket for taking you back with me and you are going we will return on the fruit steamer that comes back by this island to morrow to leave its inspectors i acknowledge gentlemen that i m not quite sure which one of you is williams but wade williams goes back to chatham county to morrow i want you to understand that a great sound of merry laughter from morgan and reeves went out over the still harbour two or three fishermen in the fleet of sloops anchored there looked up at the house of the diablos americanos on the hill and wondered my dear mr plunkett cried morgan conquering his mirth the dinner is getting cold let us sit down and eat i am anxious to get my spoon into that shark fin soup business afterward sit down gentlemen if you please added reeves pleasantly i am sure mr plunkett will not object perhaps a little time may be of advantage to him in identi fying the gentlemen he wishes to arrest no objections i m sure said plunkett dropping into his chair heavily i m hungry myself i didn t want to accept the hospitality of you folks without giving you notice that s all reeves set bottles and glasses on the table there s cognac he said and anisada and scotch smoke and rye take your choice bridger chose rye reeves poured three fingers of scotch for himself morgan took the same the sheriff against much protestation filled his glass from the water bottle here s to the appetite said reeves raising his glass of mr williams morgan s laugh and his drink encountering sent him into a choking splutter all began to pay attention to the dinner which was well cooked and palatable williams called plunkett suddenly and sharply all looked up wonderingly reeves found the sheriff s mild eye resting upon him he flushed a little see here he said with some asperity my name s reeves and i don t want you too but the comedy of the thing came to his rescue and he ended with a laugh i suppose mr plunkett said morgan carefully seasoning an alligator pear that you are aware of the fact that you will import a good deal of trouble for your self into kentucky if you take back the wrong man that is of course if you take anybody back thank you for the salt said the sheriff oh i ll take somebody back it ll be one of you two gentlemen yes i know i d get stuck for damages if i make a mis take but i m going to try to get the right man i ll tell you what you do said morgan leaning for ward with a jolly twinkle in his eyes you take me i ll go without any trouble the cocoanut business hasn t panned out well this year and i d like to make some extra money out of your bondsmen that s not fair chimed in reeves i got only a thousand for my last shipment take me mr plunkett i ll take wade williams said the sheriff patiently or i ll come pretty close to it it s like dining with a ghost remarked morgan with a pretended shiver the ghost of a murderer too will somebody pass the toothpicks to the shade of the naughty mr williams plunkett seemed as unconcerned as if he were dining at his own table in chatham county he was a gallant trencherman and the strange tropic viands tickled his palate heavy commonplace almost slothful in his movements he appeared to be devoid of all the cunning and watchfulness of the sleuth he even ceased to observe with any sharpness or attempted discrimination the two men one of whom he had undertaken with sur prising self confidence to drag away upon the serious charge of wife murder here indeed was a problem set before him that if wrongly solved would have amounted to his serious discomfiture yet there he sat puzzling his soul to all appearances over the novel flavour of a broiled iguana cutlet the consul felt a decided discomfort reeves and morgan were his friends and pals yet the sheriff from kentucky had a certain right to his official aid and moral support so bridger sat the silentest around the board and tried to estimate the peculiar situation his con clusion was that both reeves and morgan quickwitted as he knew them to be had conceived at the moment of plunkett s disclosure of his mission and in the brief space of a lightning flash the idea that the other might be the guilty williams and that each of them had decided in that moment loyally to protect his comrade against the doom that threatened him this was the consul s theory and if he had been a bookmaker at a race of wits for life and liberty he would have offered heavy odds against the plodding sheriff from chatham county kentucky when the meal was concluded the carib woman came and removed the dishes and cloth reeves strewed them table with excellent cigars and plunkett with the others lighted one of these with evident gratification i may be dull said morgan with a grin and a wink at bridger but i want to know if i am now i say this is all a joke of mr plunkett s concocted to frighten two babes in the woods is this williamson to be taken seriously or not williams corrected plunkett gravely i never got off any jokes in my life i know i wouldn t travel miles to get off a poor one as this would be if i didn t take wade williams back with me gentlemen continued the sheriff now letting his mild eyes travel impartially from one of the company to another see if you can find any joke in this case wade williams is listening to the words i utter now but out of politeness i will speak of him as a third person for five years he made his wife lead the life of a dog no i ll take that back no dog in kentucky was ever treated as she was he spent the money that she brought him spent it at races at the card table and on horses and hunting he was a good fellow to his friends but a cold sullen demon at home he wound up the five years of neglect by strik ing her with his closed hand a hand as hard as a stone when she was ill and weak from suffering she died the next day and he skipped that s all there is to it it s enough i never saw williams but i knew his wife i m not a man to tell half she and i were keep ing company when she met him she went to louisville on a visit and saw him there i ll admit that he spoilt my chances in no time i lived then on the edge of the cumberland mountains i was elected sheriff of chatham county a year after wade williams killed his wife my official duty sends me out here after him but i ll admit that there s personal feeling too and he s going back with me mr er reeves will you pass me a match awfully imprudent of williams said morgan putting his feet up against the wall to strike a kentucky lady seems to me i ve heard they were scrappers bad bad williams said reeves pouring out more scotch the two men spoke lightly but the consul saw and felt the tension and the carefulness in their actions and words good old fellows he said to himself they re both all right each of em is standing by the other like a little brick church and then a dog walked into the room where they sat a black and tan hound long eared lazy confident of welcome plunkett turned his head and looked at the animal which halted confidently within a few feet of his chair suddenly the sheriff with a deep mouthed oath left his seat and bestowed upon the dog a vicious and heavy kick with his ponderous shoe the hound heartbroken astonished with flapping ears and incurved tail uttered a piercing yelp of pain and surprise reeves and the consul remained in their chairs say ing nothing but astonished at the unexpected show of intolerance from the easy going man from chatham county but morgan with a suddenly purpling face leaped to his feet and raised a threatening arm above the guest you brute he shouted passionately why did you do that quickly the amenities returned plunkett muttered some indistinct apology and regained his seat morgan with a decided effort controlled his indignation and also returned to his chair and then plunkett with the spring of a tiger leaped around the corner of the table and snapped handcuffs on the paralyzed morgan s wrists hound lover and woman killer he cried get ready to meet your god when bridger had finished i asked him did he get the right man he did said the consul and how did he know i inquired being in a kind of bewilderment when he put morgan in the dory answered bridger the next day to take him aboard the pajaro this man plunkett stopped to shake hands with me and i asked him the same question mr bridger said he i m a kentuckian and i ve seen a great deal of both men and animals and i never yet saw a man that was overfond of horses and dogs but what was cruel to women the hypotheses of failure lawyer gooch bestowed his undivided attention upon the engrossing arts of his profession but one flight of fancy did he allow his mind to entertain he was fond of likening his suite of office rooms to the bot tom of a ship the rooms were three in number with a door opening from one to another these doors could also be closed ships lawyer gooch would say are constructed for safety with separate water tight compartments in their bottoms if one compartment springs a leak it fills with water but the good ship goes on unhurt were it not for the separating bulkheads one leak would sink the vessel now it often happens that while i am occu pied with clients other clients with conflicting interests call with the assistance of archibald an office boy with a future i cause the dangerous influx to be diverted into separate compartments while i sound with my legal plummet the depth of each if neces sary they may be haled into the hallway and permitted to escape by way of the stairs which we may term the lee scuppers thus the good ship of business is kept afloat whereas if the element that supports her were allowed to mingle freely in her hold we might be swamped ha ha ha the law is dry good jokes are few surely it might be permitted lawyer gooch to mitigate the bore of briefs the tedium of torts and the prosiness of processes with even so light a levy upon the good property of humour lawyer gooch s practice leaned largely to the settle ment of marital infelicities did matrimony languish through complications he mediated soothed and arbi trated did it suffer from implications he readjusted defended and championed did it arrive at the extremity of duplications he always got light sentences for his clients but not always was lawyer gooch the keen armed wily belligerent ready with his two edged sword to lop off the shackles of hymen he had been known to build up instead of demolishing to reunite instead of severing to lead erring and foolish ones back into the fold instead of scattering the flock often had he by his eloquent and moving appeals sent husband and wife weeping back into each other s arms frequently he had coached childhood so successfully that at the psychological moment and at a given signal the plaintive pipe of papa won t you turn home adain to me and muvver had won the day and upheld the pillars of a tottering home unprejudiced persons admitted that lawyer gooch received as big fees from these revoked clients as would have been paid him had the cases been contested in court prejudiced ones intimated that his fees were doubled because the penitent couples always came back later for the divorce anyhow there came a season in june when the legal ship of lawyer gooch to borrow his own figure was nearly becalmed the divorce mill grinds slowly in june it is the month of cupid and hymen lawyer gooch then sat idle in the middle room of his clientless suite a small anteroom connected or rather separated this apartment from the hallway here was stationed archibald who wrested from visitors their cards or oral nomenclature which he bore to his master while they waited suddenly on this day there came a great knocking at the outermost door archibald opening it was thrust aside as superfluous by the visitor who without due reverence at once pene trated to the office of lawyer gooch and threw himself with good natured insolence into a comfortable chair facing that gentlemen you are phineas c gooch attorney at law said the visitor his tone of voice and inflection making his words at once a question an assertion and an accusation before committing himself by a reply the lawyer esti mated his possible client in one of his brief but shrewd and calculating glances the man was of the emphatic type large sized active bold and debonair in demeanour vain beyond a doubt slightly swaggering ready and at ease he was well clothed but with a shade too much ornateness he was seeking a lawyer but if that fact would seem to saddle him with troubles they were not patent in his beaming eye and courageous air my name is gooch at length the lawyer admitted upon pressure he would also have confessed to the phineas c but he did not consider it good practice to volunteer information i did not receive your card he continued by way of rebuke so i i know you didn t remarked the visitor coolly and you won t just yet light up he threw a leg over an arm of his chair and tossed a handful of rich hued cigars upon the table lawyer gooch knew the brand he thawed just enough to accept the invitation to smoke you are a divorce lawyer said the cardless visitor this time there was no interrogation in his voice nor did his words constitute a simple assertion they formed a charge a denunciation as one would say to a dog you are a dog lawyer gooch was silent under the imputation you handle continued the visitor all the various ramifications of busted up connubiality you are a surgeon we might saw who extracts cupid s darts when he shoots em into the wrong parties you furnish patent incandescent lights for premises where the torch of hymen has burned so low you can t light a cigar at it am i right mr gooch i have undertaken cases said the lawyer guardedly in the line to which your figurative speech seems to refer do you wish to consult me professionally mr the lawyer paused with significance not yet said the other with an arch wave of his cigar not just yet let us approach the subject with the caution that should have been used in the original act that makes this pow wow necessary there exists a matrimonial jumble to be straightened out but before i give you names i want your honest well anyhow your professional opinion on the merits of the mix up i want you to size up the catastrophe abstractly you understand i m mr nobody and i ve got a story to tell you then you say what s what do you get my wireless you want to state a hypothetical case suggested lawyer gooch that s the word i was after apothecary was the best shot i could make at it in my mind the hypo thetical goes i ll state the case suppose there s a woman a deuced fine looking woman who has run away from her husband and home she s badly mashed on another man who went to her town to work up some real estate business now we may as well call this woman s husband thomas r billings for that s his name i m giving you straight tips on the cognomens the lothario chap is henry k jessup the billingses lived in a little town called susanville a good many miles from here now jessup leaves susanville two weeks ago the next day mrs billings follows him she s dead gone on this man jessup you can bet your law library on that lawyer gooch s client said this with such unctuous satisfaction that even the callous lawyer experienced a slight ripple of repulsion he now saw clearly in his fatuous visitor the conceit of the lady killer the egoistic complacency of the successful trifler now continued the visitor suppose this mrs billings wasn t happy at home we ll say she and her husband didn t gee worth a cent they ve got incom patibility to burn the things she likes billings wouldn t have as a gift with trading stamps it s tabby and rover with them all the time she s an educated woman in science and culture and she reads things out loud at meetings billings is not on he don t appreciate pro gress and obelisks and ethics and things of that sort old billings is simply a blink when it comes to such things the lady is out and out above his class now lawyer don t it look like a fair equalization of rights and wrongs that a woman like that should be allowed to throw down billings and take the man that can appreciate her incompatibility said lawyer gooch is undoubt edly the source of much marital discord and unhappiness where it is positively proved divorce would seem to be the equitable remedy are you excuse me is this man jessup one to whom the lady may safely trust her future oh you can bet on jessup said the client with a confident wag of his head jessup s all right he ll do the square thing why he left susanville just to keep pwple from talking about mrs billings but she fol lowed him up and now of course he ll stick to her when she gets a divorce all legal and proper jessup the proper thing and now said lawyer gooch continuing the hypo if you prefer and supposing that my services should ired in the case what the client rose impulsively to his feet oh dang the hypothetical business he exclaimed impatiently let s let her drop and get down to straight talk you ought to know who i am by this time i want that woman to have her divorce i ll pay for it the day you set mrs billings free i ll pay you five hundred dollars lawyer gooch s client banged his fist upon the table to punctuate his generosity if that is the case began the lawyer lady to see you sir bawled archibald bouncing in from his anteroom he had orders to always announce immediately any client that might come there was no sense in turning business away lawyer gooch took client number one by the arm and led him suavely into one of the adjoining rooms favour me by remaining here a few minutes sir said he i will return and resume our consultation with the least possible delay i am rather expecting a visit from a very wealthy old lady in connection with a will i will not keep you waiting long the breezy gentleman seated himself with obliging acquiescence aud took up a magazine the lawyer returned to the middle office carefully closing behind him the connecting door show the lady in archibald he said to the office boy who was awaiting the order a tall lady of commanding presence and sternly hand some entered the room she wore robes robes not clothes ample and fluent in her eye could be per ceived the lambent flame of genius and soul in her hand was a green bag of the capacity of a bushel and an umbrella that also seemed to wear a robe ample and fluent she accepted a chair are you mr phineas c gooch the lawyer she asked in formal and unconciliatory tones i am answered lawyer gooch without circum locution he never circumlocuted when dealing with a woman women circumlocute time is wasted when both sides in debate employ the same tactics as a lawyer sir began the lady you may have acquired some knowledge of the human heart do you believe that the pusillanimous and petty conventions of our artificial social life should stand as an obstacle in the way of a noble and affectionate heart when it finds its true mate among the miserable and worthless wretches in the world that are called men madam said lawyer gooch in the tone that he used in curbing his female clients this is an office for conducting the practice of law i am a lawyer not a philosopher nor the editor of an answers to the lovelorn column of a newspaper i have other clients waiting i will ask you kindly to come to the point well you needn t get so stiff around the gills about it said the lady with a snap of her luminous eves and a startling gyration of her umbrella business is what i ve come for i want your opinion in the matter of a suit for divorce as the vulgar would call it but which is really only the readjustment of the false and ignoble con ditions that the short sihhted laws of man have interposed between a loving i beg your pardon madam interrupted lawyer gooch with some impatience for reminding you again that this is a law office perhaps mrs wilcox mrs wilcox is all right cut in the lady with a hint of asperity and so are tolstoi and mrs gertrude atherton and omar khayyam and mr edward bok i ve read em all i would like to discuss with you the divine right of the soul as opposed to the freedom destroy ing restrictions of a bigoted and narrow minded society but i will proceed to business i would prefer to lay the matter before you in an impersonal way until vou pass upon its merits that is to describe it as a sup posable instance without you wish to state a hypothetical case said lawyer gooch i was going to say that said the lady sharply now suppose there is a woman who is all soul and heart and aspirations for a complete existence this woman has a husband who is far below her in intellect in taste in everything bah he is a brute he despises literature he sneers at the lofty thoughts of the world s great thinkers he thinks only of real estate and such sordid things he is no mate for a woman with soul we will say that this unfortunate wife one day meets with her ideal a man with brain and heart and force she loves him although this man feels the thrill of a new found affinity he is too noble too honourable to declare himself he flies from the presence of his beloved she flies after him trampling with superb indifference upon the fetters with which an unenlightened social system would bind her now what will a divorce cost eliza ann timmins the poetess of sycamore gap got one for three hundred and forty dollars can i i mean can this lady i speak of get one that cheap madam said lawyer gooch your last two or three sentences delight me with their intelligence and clearness can we not now abandon the hypothetical and come down to names and business i should say so exclaimed the lady adopting the practical with admirable readiness thomas r bil lings is the name of the low brute who stands between the happiness of his legal his legal but not his spiri tual wife and henry k jessup the noble man whom nature intended for her mate i concluded the client with an air of dramatic revelation am mrs billings gentlemen to see you sir shouted archibald invad ing the room almost at a handspring lawyer gooch arose from his chair mrs billings he said courteously allow me to conduct you into the adjoining office apartment for a few minutes i am expecting a very wealthy old gentleman on busines connected with a will in a very short while i will join you and continue our consultation with his accustomed chivalrous manner lawyer gooch ushered his soulful client into the remaining unoccupied room and came out closing the door with circumspection the next visitor introduced by archibald was a thin nervous irritable looking man of middle age with a worried and apprehensive expression of countenance he carried in one hand a small satchel which he set down upon the floor beside the chair which the lawyer placed for him his clothing was of good quality but it was worn without regard to neatness or style and appeared to be covered with the dust of travel you make a specialty of divorce cases he said in an agitated but business like tone i may say began lawyer gooch that my prac tice has not altogether avoided i know you do interrupted client number three you needn t tell me i ve heard all about you i have a case to lay before you without necessarily disclosing any connection that i might have with it that is you wish said lawyer gooch to state a hvpo thetical case you may call it that i am a plain man of business i will be as brief as possible we will first take up hypothetical woman we will say she is married uncon genially in many ways she is a superior woman phys ically she is considered to be handsome she is devoted to what she calls literature poetry and prose and such stuff her husband is a plain man in the business walks of life their home has not been happy although the husband has tried to make it so some time ago a man a stranger came to the peaceful town in which they lived and engaged in some real estate operations this woman met him and became unaccountably infatu ated with him her attentions became so open that the man felt the community to be no safe place for him so he left it she abandoned husband and home and followed him she forsook her home where she was provided with every comfort to follow this man who had inspired her with such a strange affection is there any thing more to be deplored concluded the client in a trembling voice than the wrecking of a home by a woman s uncalculating folly lawyer gooch delivered the cautious opinion that there was not this man she has gone to join resumed the visitor is not the man to make her happy it is a wild and foolish self deception that makes her think he will her husband in spite of their many disagreements is the only one capable of dealing with her sensitive and peculiar nature but this she does not realize now would you consider a divorce the logical cure in the case you present asked lawyer gooch who felt that the conversation was wandering too far from the field of business a divorce exclaimed the client feelingly almost tearfully no no not that i have read mr gooch of many instances where your sympathy and kindly inter est led you to act as a mediator between estranged hus band and wife and brought them together again let us drop the hypothetical case i need conceal no longer that it is i who am the sufferer in this sad affair the names you shall have thomas r billings and wife and henry k jessup the man with whom she is infatuated client number three laid his hand upon mr gooch s arm deep emotion was written upon his careworn face for heaven s sake he said fervently help me in this hour of trouble seek out mrs billings and persuade her to abandon this distressing pursuit of her lamentable folly tell her mr gooch that her husband is willing to receive her back to his heart and home promise her anything that will induce her to return i have heard of your success in these matters mrs bil lings cannot be very far away i am worn out with travel and weariness twice during the pursuit i saw her but various circumstances prevented our having an inter view will you undertake this mission for me mr gooch and earn my everlasting gratitude it is true said lawver gooch frowning slightly at the other s last words but immediately calling up an expression of virtuous benevolence that on a number of occasions i have been successful in persuading couples who sought the severing of their matrimonial bonds to think better of their rash intentions and return to their homes reconciled but i assure you that the work is often exceedingly difficult the amount of argument perseverance and if i may be allowed to say it eloquence that it requires would astonish you but this is a case in which my sympathies would be wholly enlisted i feel deeply for you sir and i would be most happy to see husband and wife reunited but my time concluded the lawyer looking at his watch as if suddenly reminded of the fact is valuable i am aware of that said the client and if you will take the case and persuade mrs billings to return home and leave the man alone that she is following on that day i will pay you the sum of one thousand dollars i have made a little money in real estate during the recent boom in susanville and i will not begrudge that amount retain your seat for a few moments please said lawyer gooch arising and again consulting his watch i have another client waiting in an adjoining room whom i had very nearly forgotten i will return in the briefest possible space the situation was now one that fully satisfied lawyer gooch s love of intricacy and complication he revelled in cases that presented such subtle problems and possi bilities it pleased him to think that he was master of the happiness and fate of the three individuals who sat uncon cious of one another s presence within his reach his old figure of the ship glided into his mind but now the figure failed for to have filled every compartment of an actual vessel would have been to endanger her safety with his compartments full his ship of affairs could but sail on to the advantageous port of a fine fat fee the thing for him to do of course was to wring the best bargain he could from some one of his anxious cargo first he called to the office boy lock the outer door archibald and admit no one then he moved with long silent strides into the room in which client number one waited that gentleman sat patiently scanning the pictures in the magazine with a

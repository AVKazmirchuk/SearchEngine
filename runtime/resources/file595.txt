physicians in town by this time i knew exactly what to do when i needed medical treatment i hung my hat on the back of a chair and said rapidly doctor i have cirrhosis of the heart indurated arteries neurasthenia neuritis acute indigestion and convalescence i am going to live on a strict diet i shall also take a tepid bath at night and a cold one in the morning i shall endeavour to be cheerful and fix my mind on pleasant subjects in the way of drugs i intend to take a phosphorous pill three times a day preferably after meals and a tonic composed of the tinctures of gentian cinchona calisaya and cardamom compound into each teaspoonful of this i shall mix tincture of nux vomica beginning with one drop and increasing it a drop each day until the maximum dose is reached i shall drop this with a medicine dropper which can be procured at a trifling cost at any pharmacy good morning i took my hat and walked out after i had closed the door i remembered something that i had forgotten to say i opened it again the doctor had not moved from where he had been sitting but he gave a slightly nervous start when he saw me again i forgot to mention said i that i shall also take absolute rest and exercise after this consultation i felt much better the reestablishing in my mind of the fact that i was hopelessly ill gave me so much satisfaction that i almost became gloomy again there is nothing more alarming to a neurasthenic than to feel himself growing well and cheerful john looked after me carefully after i had evinced so much interest in his white orpington chicken he tried his best to divert my mind and was particular to lock his hen house of nights gradually the tonic mountain air the wholesome food and the daily walks among the hills so alleviated my malady that i became utterly wretched and despondent i heard of a country doctor who lived in the mountains nearby i went to see him and told him the whole story he was a gray bearded man with clear blue wr inkled eyes in a home made suit of gray jeans in order to save time i diagnosed my case touched my nose with my right forefinger struck myself below the knee to make my foot kick sounded my chest stuck out my tongue and asked him the price of cemetery lots in pineville he lit his pipe and looked at me for about three minutes brother he said after a while you are in a mighty bad way there s a chance for you to pull through but it s a mighty slim one what can it be i asked eagerly i have taken arsenic and gold phosphorus exercise nux vomica hydrotherapeutic baths rest excitement codein and aromatic spirits of ammonia is there anything left in the pharmacopoeia somewhere in these mountains said the doctor there s a plant growing a flowering plant that ll cure you and it s about the only thing that will it s of a kind that s as old as the world but of late it s powerful scarce and hard to find you and i will have to hunt it up i m not engaged in active practice now i m getting along in years but i ll take your case you ll have to come every day in the afternoon and help me hunt for this plant till we find it the city doctors may know a lot about new scientific things but they don t know much about the cures that nature carries around in her saddlebags so every day the old doctor and i hunted the cure all plant among the mountains and valleys of the blue ridge together we toiled up steep heights so slippery with fallen autumn leaves that we had to catch every sapling and branch within our reach to save us from falling we waded through gorges and chasms breast deep with laurel and ferns we followed the banks of mountain streams for miles we wound our way like indians through brakes of pine road side hill side river side mountain side we explored in our search for the miraculous plant as the old doctor said it must have grown scarce and hard to find but we followed our quest day by day we plumbed the valleys scaled the heights and tramped the plateaus in search of the miraculous plant mountain bred he never seemed to tire i often reached home too fatigued to do anything except fall into bed and sleep until morning this we kept up for a month one evening after i had returned from a six mile tramp with the old doctor amaryllis and i took a little walk under the trees near the road we looked at the mountains drawing their royal purple robes around them for their night s repose i m glad you re well again she said when you first came you frightened me i thought you were really ill well again i almost shrieked do you know that i have only one chance in a thousand to live amaryllis looked at me in surprise why said she you are as strong as one of the plough mules you sleep ten or twelve hours every night and you are eating us out of house and home what more do you want i tell you said i that unless we find the magic that is the plant we are looking for in time nothing can save me the doctor tells me so what doctor doctor tatum the old doctor who lives halfway up black oak mountain do you know him i have known him since i was able to talk and is that where you go every day is it he who takes you on these long walks

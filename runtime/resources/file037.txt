to the last brave earning his sobriquet then came prosperity in the form of waxing herds and broadening lands and then old age and bitterness when he sat with his great mane of hair as white as the spanish dagger blossoms and his fierce pale blue eyes on the shaded gallery at cibolo growling like the pumas that he had slain he snapped his fingers at old age the bitter taste to life did not come from that the cup that stuck at his lips was that his only son ransom wanted to marry a curtis the last youthful survivor of the other end of the feud for a while the only sounds to be heard at the store were the rattling of the tin spoons and the gurgling intake of the juicy fruits by the cowpunchers the stamping of the grazing ponies and the singing of a doleful song by sam as he contentedly brushed his stiff auburn hair for the twentieth time that day before a crinkly mirror from the door of the store could be seen the irregular sloping stretch of prairie to the south with its reaches of light green billowy mesquite flats in the lower places and its rises crowned with nearly black masses of short chaparral through the mesquite flat wound the ranch road that five miles away flowed into the old government trail to san antonio the sun was so low that the gentlest elevation cast its grey shadow miles into the green gold sea of sunshine that evening ears were quicker than eyes the mexican held up a tawny finger to still the scraping of tin against tin one waggeen said he cross dthe arroyo hondo ah hear dthe wheel verree rockee place dthe hondo you ve got good ears gregorio said mustang taylor i never heard nothin but the song bird in the bush and the zephyr skallyhootin across the peaceful dell in ten minutes taylor remarked i see the dust of a wagon risin right above the fur end of the flat you have verree good eyes senor said gregorio smiling two miles away they saw a faint cloud dimming the green ripples of the mesquites in twenty minutes they heard the clatter of the horses hoofs in five minutes more the grey plugs dashed out of the thicket whickering for oats and drawing the light wagon behind them like a toy from the jacals came a cry of el amo el amo four mexican youths raced to unharness the greys the cowpunchers gave a yell of greeting and delight ranse truesdell driving threw the reins to the ground and laughed it s under the wagon sheet boys he said i know what you re waiting for if sam lets it run out again we ll use those yellow shoes of his for a target there s two cases pull em out and light up i know you all want a smoke after striking dry country ranse had removed the wagon sheet from the bows and thrown it over the goods in the wagon six pair of hasty hands dragged it off and grabbled beneath the sacks and blankets for the cases of tobacco long collins tobacco messenger from the san gabriel outfit who rode with the longest stirrups west of the mississippi delved with an arm like the tongue of a wagon he caught something harder than a blanket and pulled out a fearful thing a shapeless muddy bunch of leather tied together with wire and twine from its ragged end like the head and claws of a disturbed turtle protruded human toes who ee yelled long collins ranse are you a packin around of corpuses here s a howlin grasshoppers up from his long slumber popped curly like some vile worm from its burrow he clawed his way out and sat blinking like a disreputable drunken owl his face was as bluish red and puffed and seamed and cross lined as the cheapest round steak of the butcher his eyes were swollen slits his nose a pickled beet his hair would have made the wildest thatch of a jack in the box look like the satin poll of a cleo de merode the rest of him was scarecrow done to the life ranse jumped down from his seat and looked at his strange cargo with wide open eyes here you maverick what are you doing in my wagon how did you get in there the punchers gathered around in delight for the time they had forgotten tobacco curly looked around him slowly in every direction he snarled like a scotch terrier through his ragged beard where is this he rasped through his parched throat it s a damn farm in an old field what d you bring me here for say did i say i wanted to come here what are you reubs rubberin at hey g wan or i ll punch some of yer faces drag him out collins said ranse curly took a slide and felt the ground rise up and collide with his shoulder blades he got up and sat on the steps of the store shivering from outraged nerves hugging his knees and sneering taylor lifted out a case of tobacco and wrenched off its top six cigarettes began to glow bringing peace and forgiveness to sam how d you come in my wagon repeated ranse this time in a voice that drew a reply curly recognised the tone he had heard it used by freight brakemen and large persons in blue carrying clubs me he growled oh was you talkin to me why i was on my way to the menger but my valet had forgot to pack my pyjamas so i crawled into that wagon in the wagon yard see i never told you to bring me out to this bloomin farm see what is it mustang asked poky rodgers almost forgetting to smoke in his ecstasy what do it live on

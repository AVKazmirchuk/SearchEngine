blocks away he turned with her up the steps of a red brick house facing a little park what house is this she asked drawing back why are you going in there a street lamp shone brightly in front there was a brass nameplate at one side of the closed front doors cork drew her firmly up the steps read that said he she looked at the name on the plate and gave a cry between a moan and a scream no no no

up the steps here what are you doing with that girl he called gruffly she ll be all right in a minute said cork it s a straight deal reverend jeremiah jones read the cop from the door plate with true detective cunning correct said cork on the dead level we re goin to get married the venturers let the story wreck itself on the spreading rails of the non sequitur limited if it will first you must take your seat in the observation car raison d tre for one moment it is for no longer than to consider a brief essay on the subject let us call it what s around the corner omne mundus in duas partes divisum est men who wear rubbers and pay poll taxes and men who discover new continents there are no more continents to discover but by the time overshoes are out of date and the poll has developed into an income tax the other half will be paralleling the canals of mars with radium railways fortune chance and adventure are given as synonymous in the dictionaries to the knowing each has a different meaning fortune is a prize to be won adventure is the road to it chance is what may lurk in the shadows at the roadside the face of fortune is radiant and alluring that of adventure is flushed and heroic the face of chance is the beautiful countenance perfect because vague and dream born that we see in our tea cups at breakfast while we growl over our chops and toast the venturer is one who keeps his eye on the hedgerows and wayside groves and meadows while he travels the road to fortune that is the difference between him and the adventurer eating the forbidden fruit was the best record ever made by a venturer trying to prove that it happened is the highest work of the adventuresome to be either is disturbing to the cosmogony of creation so as bracket sawed and city

with himself must have his opinions corroborated and his moods matched by some one else i had written that somebody but an a d t boy who once took a telegram for me pointed out that i could save money

narrowing influences of the tribe of manhattan had denied him full privilege he had trodden all the main traveled thoroughfares and many of the side roads that are supposed to relieve the tedium of life but none had sufficed the reason was that he knew what was to be found at the end of every street he knew from experience and logic almost precisely to what end each digression from routine must lead he found a depressing monotony in all the variations that the music of his sphere had grafted upon the tune

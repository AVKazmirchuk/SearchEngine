the half dead frenchman in the corner has got you to the point where i thought i better horn in i got to revolving it around in my mind and i seen if somethin wasn t done and done soon there d be murder around here and maybe his head gave an imperceptible list toward the girl s room worse he stopped but he held up a stubby finger to keep any one else from speaking then he plowed slowly through the drift of his ideas about this here woman i know you ross and i know what you reely think about women if she hadn t happened in here durin this here snow you d never have given two thoughts to the whole woman question likewise when the storm clears and you and the boys go hustlin out this here whole business ll clear out of your head and you won t think of a skirt again until kingdom come just because o this snow here don t forget you re living in the selfsame world you was in four days ago and you re the same man too now what s the use o getting all snarled up over four days of stickin in the house that there s what i been revolvin in my mind and this here s the decision i ve come to he plodded to the door and shouted to one of the ranch hands to saddle my horse ross lit a stogy and stood thoughtful in the middle of the room then he began i ve a durn good notion george to knock your confounded head off and throw you into that snowbank if you re wrong mister that ain t a durned good notion you ve got it s durned bad look here he pointed steadily out of doors until we were both forced to follow his finger you re in here for more n a week yet after allowing this fact to sink in he barked out at ross can you cook then at me can you cook then he looked at the wreck of etienne and sniffed there was an embarrassing silence as ross and i thought solemnly of a foodless week if you just use hoss sense concluded george and don t go for to hurt my feelin s all i want to do is to take this young gal down to hicksville and then i ll head back here and cook fer you the horse and miss adams arrived simultaneously both of them very serious and quiet the horse because he knew what he had before him in that weather the girl because of what she had left behind then all at once i awoke to a realization of what the cook was doing my god man i cried aren t you afraid to go out in that snow behind my back i heard ross mutter not him george lifted the girl daintily up behind the saddle drew on his gloves put his foot in the stirrup and turned to inspect me leisurely as i passed slowly in his review i saw in my mind s eye the algebraic equation of snow the equals sign and the answer in the man before me snow is my last name said george he swung into the saddle and they started cautiously out into the darkening swirl of fresh new currency just issuing from the snowdrop mint the girl to keep her place clung happily to the sturdy figure of the camp cook i brought three things away from ross curtis s ranch house yes four one was the appreciation of snow which i have so humbly tried here to render was a collarbone of which i am extra careful was a memory of what it is to eat very extremely bad food for a week and was the cause of a little note delivered at the end of the week and hand painted in blue pencil on a sheet of meat paper i cannot come back there to that there job mrs snow say no george i been revolvin it in my mind considerin circumstances she s right whirligigs the world and the door a favourite dodge to get your story read by the public is to assert that it is true and then add that truth is stranger than fiction i do not know if the yarn i am anxious for you to read is true but the spanish purser of the fruit steamer el carrero swore to me by the shrine of santa guadalupe that he had the facts from the u s vice consul at la paz a person who could not possibly have been cognizant of half of them as for the adage quoted above i take pleasure in punc turing it by affirming that i read in a purely fictional story the other day the line be it so said the police man nothing so strange has yet cropped out in truth when h ferguson hedges millionaire promoter investor and man about new york turned his thoughts upon matters convivial and word of it went down the line bouncers took a precautionary turn at the indian clubs waiters put ironstone china on his favourite tables cab drivers crowded close to the curbstone in front of all night caf s and careful cashiers in his regular haunts charged up a few bottles to his account by way of preface and introduction as a money power a one millionaire is of small account in a city where the man who cuts your slice of beef behind the free lunch counter rides to work in his own automobile but hedges spent his money as lavishly loudly and showily as though he were only a clerk squandering a week s wages and after all the bartender takes no interest in your reserve fund he would rather look you up on his cash register than in bradstreet on the evening

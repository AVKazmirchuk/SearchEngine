crackerjack said sammy admiringly there are five more verses said ravenel pa tiently sardonic one naturally pauses at the end of each of course oh let s have the rest old man shouted sammy contritely i didn t mean to cut you off i m not much of a poetry expert you know i never saw a poem that didn t look like it ought to have terminal facilities at the end of every verse reel off the rest of it ravenel sighed and laid the magazine down all right said sammy cheerfully we ll have it next time i ll be off now got a date at five o clock he took a last look at the shaded green garden and left whistling in an off key an untuneful air from a roofless farce comedy the next afternoon ravenel while polishing a ragged line of a new sonnet reclined by the window overlooking the besieged garden of the unmercenary baron suddenly he sat up spilling two rhymes and a syllable or two through the trees one window of the old mansion could be seen clearly in its window draped in flow ing white leaned the angel of all his dreams of ro mance and poesy young fresh as a drop of dew graceful as a spray of clematis conferring upon the garden hemmed in by the roaring traffic the air of a princess s bower beautiful as any flower sung by poet thus ravenel saw her for the first time she lingered for a while and then disappeared within leaving a few notes of a birdlike ripple of song to reach his entranced ears through the rattle of cabs and the snarling of the electric cars thus as if to challenge the poet s flaunt at ro mance and to punish him for his recreancy to the undying spirit of youth and beauty this vision bad dawned upon him with a thrilling and accusive power and so metabolic was the power that in an instant the atoms of ravenel s entire world were redistrib uted the laden drays that passed the house in which she lived rumbled a deep double bass to the tune of love the newsboys shouts were the notes of singing birds that garden was the pleasance of the capulets the janitor was an ogre himself a knight ready with sword lance or lute thus does romance show herself amid forests of brick and stone when she gets lost in the city and there has to be sent out a general alarm to find her again at four in the afternoon ravenel looked out across the garden in the window of his hopes were set four small vases each containing a great full blown rose red and white and as he gazed she leaned above them shaming them with her loveliness and seeming to direct her eyes pensively toward his own window and then as though she had caught his respectful but ardent regard she melted away leaving the fragrant emblems on the window sill yes emblems he would be unworthy if be had not understood she had read his poem the four roses it had reached her heart and this was its romantic answer of course she must know that ravenel the poet lived there across her garden his picture too she must have seen in the magazines the delicate tender modest flattering message could not be ignored ravenel noticed beside the roses a small flowering pot containing a plant without shame be brought his opera glasses and employed them from the cover of his window curtain a nutmeg geranium with the true poetic instinct be dragged a book of useless information from his shelves and tore open the leaves at the language of flowers geranium nutmeg i expect a meeting so romance never does things by halves if she comes back to you she brings gifts and her knitting and will sit in your chimney corner if you will let her and now ravenel smiled the lover smiles when be thinks he has won the woman who loves ceases to smile with victory he ends a battle she begins hers what a pretty idea to set the four roses in her window for him to see she must have a sweet poetic soul and now to contrive the meeting a whistling and slamming of doors preluded the coming of sammy brown ravenel smiled again even sammy brown was shone upon by the far flung rays of the renaissance sammy with his ultra clothes his horseshoe pin his plump face his trite slang his uncomprehending admiration of ravenel the broker s clerk made an excellent foil to the new bright unseen visitor to the poet s sombre apartment sammy went to his old seat by the window and looked out over the dusty green foliage in the garden then he looked at his watch and rose hastily by grabs he exclaimed twenty after four i can t stay old man i ve got a date at why did you come then asked ravenel with sarcastic jocularity if you had an engagement at that time i thought you business men kept better account of your minutes and seconds than that sammy hesitated in the doorway and turned pinker fact is ravvy be explained as to a customer whose margin is exhausted i didn t know i had it till i came i ll tell you old man there s a dandy girl in that old house next door that i m dead gone on i put it straight we re engaged the old man says nit but that don t go he keeps her pretty close i can see edith s window from yours here she gives me a tip when she s going shopping and i meet her it s to day maybe i ought to have explained sooner but i know it s all right with you so long how do you get your tip as you call it asked ravenel losing a little spontaneity from his smile roses said sammy briefly four of em to day means four o clock at the corner of broadway and twenty third but the geranium persisted ravenel clutch ing at the end of flying romance s trailing robe means half past shouted sammy from the hall see you to morrow the city of dreadful night during the recent warmed over spell said my friend carney driver of express wagon no a good many opportunities was had of observing human nature through peekaboo waists the park commissioner and the commissioner of polis and the forestry commission gets together and agrees to let the people sleep in the parks until the weather bureau gets the thermometer down again to a living basis so they draws up open air resolu tions and has them k d by the secretary of agri culture mr comstock and the village improvement mosquito exterminating society of south orange n j when the proclamation was made opening up to the people by special grant the public parks that be long to em there was a general exodus into central park by the communities existing along its borders in ten minutes after sundown you d have thought that there was an undress rehearsal of a potato famine in ireland and a kishineff massacre they come by families gangs clambake societies clans clubs and tribes from all sides to enjoy a cool sleep on the grass them that didn t have oil stoves brought along plenty of blankets so as not to be upset with the cold and discomforts of sleeping outdoors by building fires of the shade trees and huddling together in the bridle paths and burrowing under the grass where the ground was soft enough the likes of head of people successfully battled against the night air in central park alone ye know i live in the elegant furnished apart ment house called the beersheba flats over against the elevated portion of the new york central rail road when the order come to the flats that all hands must turn out and sleep in the park according to the instructions of the consulting committee of the city club and the murphy draying returfing and sod ding company there was a look of a couple of fires and an eviction all over the place the tenants began to pack up feather beds rub ber boots strings of garlic hot water bags porta ble canoes and scuttles of coal to take along for the sake of comfort the sidewalk looked like a russian camp in oyama s line of mareb there was waiting and lamenting up and down stairs from danny geog hegan s flat on the top floor to the apartments of missis goldsteinupski on the first for why says danny coming down and raging in his blue yarn socks to the janitor should i be turned out of me comfortable apartments to lay in the dirty grass like a rabbit tis like jerome to stir up trouble wid small matters like this instead of whist says officer reagan on the sidewalk rapping with his club tis not jerome tis by order of the polis commissioner turn out every one of yez and hike yerselves to the park now twas a peaceful and happy home that all of us had in them same beersheba flats the o dowds and the steinowitzes and the callahans and the cohens and the spizzinellis and the mcmanuses and the spiegelmayers and the joneses all nations of us we lived like one big family together and when the hot nights come along we kept a line of children reaching from the front door to kelly s on the corner passing along the cans of beer from one to another without the trouble of running after it and with no more clothing on than is provided for in the statutes sitting in all the windies with a cool growler in every one and your feet out in the air and the rosenstein girls singing on the fire escape of the sixth floor and patsy rourke s flute going in the eighth and the ladies calling each other synonyms out the win dies and now and then a breeze sailing in over mister depew s central i tell you the beersheba flats was a summer resort that made the catskills look like a bole in the ground with his person full of beer and his feet out the windy and his old woman frying pork chops over a charcoal furnace and the children dancing in cotton slips on the sidewalk around the organ grinder and the rent paid for a week what does a man want better on a hot night than that and then comes this ruling of the polis driving people out o their comfortable homes to sleep in parks twas for all the world like a ukase of them rus sians twill be heard from again at next election time well then officer reagan drives the whole lot of us to the park and turns us in by the nearest gate tis dark under the trees and all the children sets up to howling that they want to go home ye ll pass the night in this stretch of woods and scenery says officer reagan twill be fine and imprisonment for insoolting the park commis sioner and the chief of the weather bureau if ye re fuse i m in charge of thirty acres between here and the agyptian monument and i advise ye to give no trouble tis sleeping on the grass yez all have been condemned to by the authorities yez ll be permitted to leave in the morning but ye must retoorn be night me orders was silent on the subject of bail but i find out if tis required and there ll be bondsmen at the gate there being no lights except along the automo bile drives us tenants of the beersheba flats prepared to spend the night as best we could in the raging forest them that brought blankets and kin dling wood was best off they got fires started and wrapped the blankets round their heads and laid down cursing in the grass there was nothing to see nothing to drink nothing to do in the dark we had no way of telling friend or foe except by feeling the noses of em i brought along me last winter overcoat me toothbrush some quinine pills and the red quilt off the bed in me flat three times during the night somebody rolled on me quilt and stuck his knees against the adam s apple of me and three times i judged his character by running me hand over his face and three times i rose up and kicked the in truder down the hill to the gravelly walk below and then some one with a flavor of kelly s whiskey snug gled up to me and i found his nose turned up the right way and i says is that you then patsey and he says it is carney how long do you think it ll last i m no weather prophet says i but if they bring out a strong anti tammany ticket next fall it ought to get us home in time to sleep on a bed once or twice before they line us up at the polls a playing of my flute into the airshaft i says patsey rourke and a perspiring in me own windy to the joyful noise of the passing trains and the smell of liver and onions and a reading of the latest mur der in the smoke of the cooking is well enough for me says he what is this herding us in grass for not to mention the crawling things with legs that walk up the trousers of us and the jersey snipes that peck at us masquerading under the name and denom ination of mosquitoes what is it all for carney and the rint going on just the same over at the flats tis the great annual municipal free night outing lawn party says i given by the polis hetty green and the drug trust during the heated season they hold a week of it in the principal parks tis a scheme to reach that portion of the people that s not worth taking up to north beach for a fish fry i can t sleep on the ground says patsey wid any benefit i have the hay fever and the rheuma tism and me car is full of ants well the night goes on and the ex tenants of the flats groans and stumbles around in the dark trying to find rest and recreation in the forest the children is screaming with the coldness and the jan itor makes hot tea for em and keeps the fires going with the signboards that point to the tavern and the casino the tenants try to lay down on the grass by families in the dark but you re lucky if you can sleep next to a man from the same floor or believing in the same religion now and then a murpby acci dental rolls over on the grass of a rosenstein or a cohen tries to crawl under the o grady bush and then there s a feeling of noses and somebody is rolled down the hill to the driveway and stays there there is some hair pulling among the women folks and everybody spanks the nearest howling kid to him by the sense of feeling only regardless of its parentage and ownership tis hard to keep up the social dis tinctions in the dark that flourish by daylight in the beersheba flats mrs rafferty that despises the asphalt that a dago treads on wakes up in the morn ing with her feet in the bosom of antonio spizzinelli and mike o dowd that always threw peddlers down stairs as fast as he came upon em has to unwind old isaacstein s whiskers from around his neck and wake up the whole gang at daylight but here and there some few got acquainted and overlooked the discom forts of the elements there was five engagements to be married announced at the flats the next morning about midnight i gets up and wrings the dew out of my hair and goes to the side of the driveway and sits down at one side of the park i could see the lights in the streets and houses and i was thinking how happy them folks was who could chase the duck and smoke their pipes at their windows and keep cool and pleasant like nature intended for em to just then an automobile stops by me and a fine looking well dressed man steps out me man says he can you tell me why all these people are lying around on the grass in the park i thought it was against the rules twas an ordinance says i just passed by the polis department and ratified by the turf cut ters association providing that all persons not car rying a license number on their rear axles shall keep in the public parks until further notice fortu nately the orders comes this year during a spell of fine weather and the mortality except on the borders of the lake and along the automobile drives will not be any greater than usual who are these people on the side of the bill asks the man sure says i none others than the tenants of the beersheba flats a fine home for any man especially on hot nights may daylight come soon they come here be night says be and breathe in the pure air and the fragrance of the flowers and trees they do that says be coming every night from the burning beat of dwellings of brick and stone and wood says i and marble and plaster and iron the matter will be attended to at once says the man putting up his book are ye the park commissioner i asks i own the beersheba flats says he god bless the grass and the trees that give extra benefits to a man s tenants the rents shall be raised fifteen per cent to morrow good night says he the easter of the soul it is hardly likely that a goddess may die then eastre the old saxon goddess of spring must be laughing in her muslin sleeve at people who believe that easter her namesake exists only along certain strips of fifth avenue pavement after church service aye it belongs to the world the ptarmigan in chilkoot pass discards his winter white feathers for brown the patagonian beau brummell oils his chi gnon and clubs him another sweetheart to drag to his skull strewn flat and down in chrystie street mr tiger mcquirk arose with a feeling of disquiet that be did not understand with a prac tised foot be rolled three of his younger brothers like logs out of his way as they lay sleeping on the floor before a foot square looking glass hung by the win dow he stood and shaved himself if that may seem to you a task too slight to be thus impressively chron icled i bear with you you do not know of the areas to be accomplished in traversing the cheek and chin of mr mcquirk mcquirk senior had gone to work long before the big son of the house was idle he was a marble cutter and the marble cutters were out on a strike what ails ye asked his mother looking at him curiously are ye not feeling well the morning maybe now he s thinking along of annie maria doyle im pudently explained younger brother tim ten years old tiger reached over the hand of a champion and swept the small mcquirk from his chair i feel fine said he beyond a touch of the i don t know wbat you call its i feel like there was going to be earthquakes or music or a trifle of chills and fever or maybe a picnic i don t know how i feel i feel like knocking the face off a policeman or else maybe like playing coney island straight across the board from pop corn to the elephant boudabs it s the spring in yer bones said mrs mcquirk it s the sap risin time was when i couldn t keep me feet still nor me head cool when the earthworms began to crawl out in the dew of the mornin tis a bit of tea will do ye good made from pipsissewa and gentian bark at the druggist s back up said mr mcquirk impatiently there s no spring in sight there s snow yet on the shed in donovan s backyard and yesterday they puts open cars on the sixth avenue lines and the janitors have quit ordering coal and that means six weeks more of winter by all the signs that be after breakfast mr mcquirk spent fifteen minutes before the corrugated mirror subjugating his hair and arranging his green and purple ascot with its amethyst tombstone pin eloquent of his chosen calling since the strike had been called it was this par ticular striker s habit to hie himself each morning to the corner saloon of flaherty brothers and there establish himself upon the sidewalk with one foot resting on the bootblack s stand observing the panorama of the street until the pace of time brought twelve o clock and the dinner hour and mr tiger mcquirk with his athletic seventy inches well trained in sport and battle his smooth pale solid amiable face blue where the razor had trav elled his carefully considered clothes and air of capa bility was himself a spectacle not displeasing to the eye but on this morning mr mcquirk did not hasten immediately to his post of leisure and observation something unusual that he could not quite grasp was in the air something disturbed his thoughts ruffled his senses made him at once languid irritable elated dissastisfied and sportive he was no diagnostician and he did not know that lent was breaking up physiologically in his system mrs mcquirk had spoken of spring sceptically tiger looked about him for signs few they were the organ grinders were at work but they were always precocious harbingers it was near enough spring for them to go penny hunting when the skating ball dropped at the park in the milliners windows easter hats grave gay and jubilant blos somed there were green patches among the side walk debris of the grocers on a third story window sill the first elbow cushion of the season old gold stripes on a crimson ground supported the kimo noed arms of a pensive brunette the wind blew cold from the east river but the sparrows were fly ing to the eaves with straws a second hand store combining foresight with faith had set out an ice chest and baseball goods and then tiger s eye discrediting these signs fell upon one that bore a bud of promise from a bright new lithograph the head of capricornus con fronted him betokening the forward and heady brew mr mcquirk entered the saloon and called for his glass of bock he threw his nickel on the bar raised the glass set it down without tasting it and strolled toward the door wot s the matter lord bolinbroke inquired the sarcastic bartender want a chiny vase or a gold lined epergne to drink it out of hey say said mr mcquirk wheeling and shooting out a horizontal hand and a forty five degree chin you know your place only when it comes for givin titles i ve changed me mind about drinkin see you got your money ain t you wait till you get stung before you get the droop to your lip will you thus mr quirk added mutability of desires to the strange humors that had taken possession of him leaving the saloon he walked away twenty steps and leaned in the open doorway of lutz the barber he and lutz were friends masking their sentiments behind abuse and bludgeons of repartee irish loafer roared lutz how do you do so not yet haf der bolicemans or der catcher of dogs done deir duty hello dutch said mr mcquirk can t get your mind off of frankfurters can you bah exclaimed the german coming and lean ing in the door i haf a soul above frankfurters to day dere is springtime in der air i can feel it coming in ofer der mud of der streets and das ice in der river soon will dere be bienics in der islands mit kegs of beer under der trees say said mr mcquirk setting his bat on one side is everybody kiddin me about gentle spring there ain t any more spring in the air than there is in a horsehair sofa in a second avenue furnished room for me the winter underwear yet and the buckwheat cakes you haf no boetry said lutz true it is yedt cold und in der city we haf not many of der signs but dere are dree kinds of beoble dot should always feel der approach of spring first dey are boets lovers and poor vidows mr mcquirk went on his way still possessed by the strange perturbation that he did not understand something was lacking to his comfort and it made him half angry because be did not know what it was two blocks away he came upon a foe one conover whom he was bound in honor to engage in combat mr mcquirk made the attack with the charac teristic suddenness and fierceness that had gained for him the endearing sobriquet of tiger the de fence of mr conover was so prompt and admirable that the conflict was protracted until the onlookers un selfishly gave the warning cry of cheese it the cop the principals escaped easily by running through the nearest open doors into the communi cating backyards at the rear of the houses mr mcquirk emerged into another street he stood by a lamp post for a few minutes engaged in thought and then he turned and plunged into a small notion and news shop a red haired young woman eating gum drops came and looked freezingly at him across the ice bound steppes of the counter say lady he said have you got a song book with this in it let s see bow it leads off when the springtime comes well wander in the dale love and whisper of those days of yore i m having a friend explained mr mcquirk laid up with a broken leg and he sent me after it he s a devil for songs and poetry when he can t get out to drink we have not replied the young woman with un concealed contempt but there is a new song out that begins this way let us sit together in the old armchair and while the firelight flickers we ll be comfortable there there will be no profit in following mr tiger mcquirk through his further vagaries of that day until he comes to stand knocking at the door of annie maria doyle the goddess eastre it seems had guided his footsteps aright at last is that you now jimmy mcquirk she cried smiling through the opened door annie maria had never accepted the tiger well whatever come out in the ball said mr mcquirk i want to ask yer opinion of the weather on the level are you crazy sure said annie maria i am said the tiger they ve been telling me all day there was spring in the air were they liars or am i dear me said annie maria haven t you no ticed it i can almost smell the violets and the green grass of course there ain t any yet it s just a kind of feeling you know that s what i m getting at said mr mcquirk i ve had it i didn t recognize it at first i thought maybe it was en wee contracted the other day when i stepped above fourteenth street but the katzenjammer i ve got don t spell violets it spells yer own name annie maria and it s you i want i go to work next monday and i make four dollars a day spiel up old girl do we make a team jimmy sighed annie maria suddenly disap pearing in his overcoat don t you see that spring is all over the world right this minute but you yourself remember how that day ended beginning with so fine a promise of vernal things late in the afternoon the air chilled and an inch of snow fell even so late in march on fifth ave nue the ladies drew their winter furs close about them only in the florists windows could be per ceived any signs of the morning smile of the coming goddess eastre at six o clock herr lutz began to close his shop he beard a well known shout hello dutch tiger mcquirk in his shirt sleeves with his hat on the back of his bead stood outside in the whirling snow puffing at a black cigar donnerwetter shouted lutz der vinter he has gome back again yet yer a liar dutch called back mr mcquirk with friendly geniality it s springtime by the watch the fool killer down south whenever any one perpetrates some particularly monumental piece of foolishness every body says send for jesse holmes jesse holmes is the fool killer of course he is a myth like santa claus and jack frost and general prosperity and all those concrete conceptions that are supposed to represent an idea that nature has failed to embody the wisest of the southrons can not tell you whence comes the fool killer s name but few and happy are the households from the ro anoke to the rio grande in which the name of jesse holmes has not been pronounced or invoked always with a smile and often with a tear is he summoned to his official duty a busy man is jesse holmes i remember the clear picture of him that hung on the walls of my fancy during my barefoot days when i was dodging his oft threatened devoirs to me be was a terrible old man in gray clothes with a long ragged gray beard and reddish fierce eyes i looked to see him come stumping up the road in a cloud of dust with a white oak staff in his hand and his shoes tied with leather thongs i may yet but this is a story not a sequel i have taken notice with regret that few stories worth reading have been written that did not con tain drink of some sort down go the fluids from arizona dick s three fingers of red pizen to the in efficacious oolong that nerves lionel montressor to repartee in the dotty dialogues so in such good company i may introduce an absinthe drip one absinthe drip dripped through a silver dripper orderly opalescent cool green eyed deceptive kerner was a fool besides that he was an artist and my good friend now if there is one thing on earth utterly despicable to another it is an artist in the eyes of an author whose story he has illus trated just try it once write a story about a mining camp in idiho sell it spend the money and then six months later borrow a quarter or a dime and buy the magazine containing it you find a full page wash drawing of your hero black bill the cowboy somewhere in your story you em ployed the word horse aha the artist has grasped the idea black bill has on the regulation trousers of the m f h of the westchester county hunt he carries a parlor rifle and wears a mon ocle in the distance is a section of forty second street during a search for a lost gas pipe and the taj mahal the famous mausoleum in india enough i hated kerner and one day i met him and we became friends he was young and glori ously melancholy because his spirits were so high and life bad so much in store for him yes he was almost riotously sad that was his youth when a man begins to be hilarious in a sorrowful way you can bet a million that he is dyeing his hair ker ner s hair was plentiful and carefully matted as an artist s thatch should be he was a cigaretteur and be audited his dinners with red wine but most of all be was a fool and wisely i envied him and listened patiently while he knocked velasquez and tintoretto once he told me that he liked a story of mine that he bad come across in an anthology he described it to me and i was sorry that mr fitz james o brien was dead and could not learn of the eulogy of his work but mostly kerner made few breaks and was a consistent fool i d better explain what i mean by that there was a girl now a girl as far as i am concerned is a thing that belongs in a seminary or an album but i conceded the existence of the animal in order to retain kerner s friendship he showed me her picture in a locket she was a blonde or a brunette i have forgotten which she worked in a factory for eight dollars a week lest factories quote this wage by way of vindication i will add that the girl bad worked for five years to reach that supreme ele vation of remuneration beginning at per week kerner s father was worth a couple of millions he was willing to stand for art but he drew the line at the factory girl so kerner disinherited his father and walked out to a cheap studio and lived on sausages for breakfast and on farroni for dinner farroni had the artistic soul and a line of credit for painters and poets nicely adjusted sometimes ker rier sold a picture and bought some new tapestry a ring and a dozen silk cravats and paid farroni two dollars on account one evening kerner had me to dinner with himself and the factory girl they were to be married as soon as kerner could slosh paint profitably as for the ex father s two millions pouf she was a wonder small and half way pretty and as much at her ease in that cheap cafe as though she were only in the palmer house chicago with a souvenir spoon already safely hidden in her shirt waist she was natural two things i noticed about her especially her belt buckle was exactly in the middle of her back and she didn t tell us that a large man with a ruby stick pin had followed her up all the way from fourteenth street was kerner such a fool i wondered and then i thought of the quantity of striped cuffs and blue glass beads that can buy for the heathen and i said to myself that he was and then elise certainly that was her name told us merrily that the brown spot on her waist was caused by her landlady knocking at the door while she the girl confound the english language was heating an iron over the gas jet and she hid the iron under the bedclothes until the coast was clear and there was the piece of chewing gum stuck to it when she began to iron the waist and well i wondered bow in the world the chewing gum came to be there don t they ever stop chewing it a while after that don t be impatient the ab sinthe drip is coming now kerner and i were dining at farroni s a mandolin and a guitar were being attacked the room was full of smoke in nice long crinkly layers just like the artists draw the steam from a plum pudding on christmas posters and a lady in a blue silk and gasolined gauntlets was be ginning to bum an air from the catskills kerner said i you are a fool of course said kerner i wouldn t let her go on working not my wife what s the use to wait she s willing i sold that water color of the pali sades yesterday we could cook on a two burner gas stove you know the ragouts i can throw together yes i think we will marry next week kerner said i you are a fool have an absinthe drip said kerner grandly to night you are the guest of art in paying quan tities i think we will get a flat with a bath i never tried one i mean an absinthe drip said i the waiter brought it and poured the water slowly over the ice in the dripper it looks exactly like the mississippi river water in the big bend below natchez said i fascinated gazing at the be muddled drip there are such flats for eight dollars a week said kerner you are a fool said i and began to sip the filtration what you need i continued is the official attention of one jesse holmes kerner not being a southerner did not compre hend so he sat sentimental figuring on his flat in his sordid artistic way while i gazed into the green eyes of the sophisticated spirit of wormwood presently i noticed casually that a procession of bacchantes limned on the wall immediately below the ceiling bad begun to move traversing the room from right to left in a gay and spectacular pilgrimage i did not confide my discovery to kerner the artistic temperament is too high strung to view such devia tions from the natural laws of the art of kalsomining i sipped my absinthe drip and sawed wormwood one absinthe drip is not much but i said again to kerner kindly you are a fool and then in the vernacular jesse holmes for yours and then i looked around and saw the fool killer as he had always appeared to my imagination sitting at a nearby table and regarding us with his reddish fatal relentless eyes he was jesse holmes from top to toe he had the long gray ragged beard the gray clothes of ancient cut the executioner s look and the dusty shoes of one who bad been called from afar his eyes were turned fixedly upon kerner i shuddered to think that i bad invoked him from his assiduous southern duties i thought of flying and then i kept my seat reflecting that many men bad es caped his ministrations when it seemed that nothing short of an appointment as ambassador to spain could save them from him i had called my brother kerner a fool and was in danger of hell fire that was nothing but i would try to save him from jesse holmes the fool killer got up from his table and came over to ours he rested his hands upon it and turned his burning vindictive eyes upon kerner ig noring me you are a hopeless fool be said to the artist haven t you had enough of starvation yet i of fer you one more opportunity give up this girl and come back to your home refuse and you must take the consequences the fool killer s threatening face was within a foot of his victim s but to my horror kerner made not the slightest sign of being aware of his presence we will be married next week be muttered ab sent mindedly with my studio furniture and some second hand stuff we can make out you have decided your own fate said the fool killer in a low but terrible voice you may con sider yourself as one dead you have had your last chance in the moonlight went on kerner softly we will sit under the skylight with our guitar and sing away the false delights of pride and money on your own head be it hissed the fool killer and my scalp prickled when i perceived that neither kerner s eyes nor his ears took the slightest cog nizance of jesse holmes and then i knew that for some reason the veil had been lifted for me alone and that i bad been elected to save my friend from de struction at the fool killer s bands something of the fear and wonder of it must have showed itself in my face excuse me said kerner with his wan amiable smile was i talking to myself i think it is getting to be a habit with me the fool killer turned and walked out of far ronils wait here for me said i rising i must speak to that man had you no answer for him because you are a fool must you die like a mouse under his foot could you not utter one squeak in your own defence you are drunk said kerner heartlessly no one addressed me the destroyer of your mind said i stood above you just now and marked you for his victim you are not blind or deaf i recognized no such person said kerner i have seen no one but you at this table sit down hereafter you shall have no more absinthe drips wait here said i furious if you don t care for your own life i will save it for you i hurried out and overtook the man in gray half way down the block he looked as i bad seen him in my fancy a thousand times truculent gray and awful he walked with the white oak staff and but for the street sprinkler the dust would have been fly ing under his tread i caught him by the sleeve and steered him to a dark angle of a building i knew he was a myth and i did not want a cop to see me conversing with va cancy for i might land in bellevue minus my silver matchbox and diamond ring jesse holmes said i facing him with apparent bravery i know you i have heard of you all my life i know now what a scourge you have been to your country instead of killing fools you have been murdering the youth and genius that are necessary to make a people live and grow great you are a fool yourself holmes you began killing off the brightest and best of our countrymen three generations ago when the old and obsolete standards of society and honor and orthodoxy were narrow and bigoted you proved that when you put your murderous mark upon my friend kerner the wisest chap i ever knew in my life the fool killer looked at me grimly and closely you ve a queer jag said he curiously oh yes i see who you are now you were sitting with him at the table well if i m not mistaken i heard you call him a fool too i did said i i delight in doing so it is from envy by all the standards that you know he is the most egregious and grandiloquent and gorgeous fool in all the world that s why you want to kill him would you mind telling me who or what you think i am asked the old man i laughed boisterously and then stopped suddenly for i remembered that it would not do to be seen so hilarious in the company of nothing but a brick wall you are jesse holmes the fool killer i said solemnly and you are going to kill my friend ker ner i don t know who rang you up but if you do kill him i ll see that you get pinched for it that is i added despairingly if i can get a cop to see you they have a poor eye for mortals and i think it would take the whole force to round up a myth mur derer well said the fool killer briskly i must be going you had better go home and sleep it off good night at this i was moved by a sudden fear for kerner to a softer and more pleading mood i leaned against the gray man s sleeve and besought him good mr fool killer please don t kill little ker ner why can t you go back south and kill con gressmen and clay caters and let us alone why don t you go up on fifth avenue and kill millionaires that keep their money locked up and won t let young fools marry because one of em lives on the wrong street come and have a drink jesse will you never get on to your job do you know this girl that your friend has made himself a fool about asked the fool killer i have the honor said i and that s why i called kerner a fool he is a fool because he has waited so long before marrying her he is a fool because be has been waiting in the hopes of getting the consent of some absurd two million dollar fool parent or something of the sort maybe said the fool killer maybe i i might have looked at it differently would you mind going back to the restaurant and bringing your friend kerner here oh what s the use jesse i yawned he can t see you he didn t know you were talking to him at the table you are a fictitious character you know maybe he can this time will you go fetch him all right said i but i ve a suspicion that you re not strictly sober jesse you seem to be wa vering and losing your outlines don t vanish before i get back i went back to kerner and said there s a man with an invisible homicidal mania waiting to see you outside i believe he wants to murder you come along you won t see him so there s nothing to be frightened about kerner looked anxious why said be i had no idea one absinthe would do that you d better stick to wurzburger i ll walk home with you i led him to jesse holmes s rudolf said the fool killer i ll give in bring her up to the house give me your hand boy good for you dad said kerner shaking hands with the old man you ll never regret it after you know her so you did see him when he was talking to you at the table i asked kerner we hadn t spoken to each other in a year said kerner it s all right now i walked away where are you going called kerner i am going to look for jesse holmes i an swered with dignity and reserve transients in arcadia there is a hotel on broadway that has escaped discovery by the summer resort promoters it is deep and wide and cool its rooms are finished in dark oak of a low temperature home made breezes and deep green shrubbery give it the delights without the inconveniences of the adirondacks one can mount its broad staircases or glide dreamily upward in its aerial elevators attended by guides in brass but tons with a serene joy that alpine climbers have never attained there is a chef in its kitchen who will prepare for you brook trout better than the white mountains ever served sea food that would turn old point comfort by gad sah green with envy and maine venison that would melt the official heart of a game warden a few have found out this oasis in the july desert of manhattan during that month you will see the hotel s reduced array of guests scattered luxuriously about in the cool twilight of its lofty dining room gazing at one another across the snowy waste of un occupied tables silently congratulatory superfluous watchful pneumatically moving wait ers hover near supplying every want before it is ex pressed the temperature is perpetual april the ceiling is painted in water colors to counterfeit a sum mer sky across which delicate clouds drift and do not vanish as those of nature do to our regret the pleasing distant roar of broadway is trans formed in the imagination of the happy guests to the noise of a waterfall filling the woods with its restful sound at every strange footstep the guests turn an anxious ear fearful lest their retreat be discovered and invaded by the restless pleasure seekers who are forever hounding nature to her deepest lairs thus in the depopulated caravansary the little band of connoisseurs jealously bide themselves during the heated season enjoying to the uttermost the de lights of mountain and seashore that art and skill have gathered and served to them in this july came to the hotel one whose card that she sent to the clerk for her name to be registered read mme he oise d arcy beaumont madame beaumont was a guest such as the hotel lotus loved she possessed the fine air of the e ite tempered and sweetened by a cordial graciousness that made the hotel employees her slaves bell boys fought for the honor of answering her ring the clerks but for the question of ownership would have deeded to her the hotel and its contents the other guests regarded her as the final touch of feminine exclusiveness and beauty that rendered the entourage perfect this super excellent guest rarely left the hotel her habits were consonant with the customs of the dis criminating patrons of the hotel lotus to enjoy that delectable hostelry one must forego the city as though it were leagues away by night a brief ex cursion to the nearby roofs is in order but during the torrid day one remains in the umbrageous fast nesses of the lotus as a trout hangs poised in the pel lucid sanctuaries of his favorite pool though alone in the hotel lotus madame beau mont preserved the state of a queen whose loneliness was of position only she breakfasted at ten a cool sweet leisurely delicate being who glowed softly in the dimness like a jasmine flower in the dusk but at dinner was madame s glory at its height she wore a gown as beautiful and immaterial as the mist from an unseen cataract in a mountain gorge the nomenclature of this gown is beyond the guess of the scribe always pale red roses reposed against its lace garnished front it was a gown that the bead waiter viewed with respect and met at the door you thought of paris when you saw it and maybe of mysterious countesses and certainly of versailles and rapiers and mrs fiske and rouge et noir there was an untraceable rumor in the hotel lotus that madame was a cosmopolite and that she was pulling with her slender white bands certain strings between the nations in the favor of russia being a citi zeness of the world s smoothest roads it was small wonder that she was quick to recognize in the refined purlieus of the hotel lotus the most desirable spot in america for a restful sojourn during the heat of mid summer on the third day of madame beaumont s residence in the hotel a young man entered and registered him self as a guest his clothing to speak of his points in approved order was quietly in the mode his features good and regular his expression that of a poised and sophisticated man of the world he in formed the clerk that he would remain three or four days inquired concerning the sailing of european steamships and sank into the blissful inanition of the nonpareil hotel with the contented air of a traveller in his favorite inn the young man not to question the veracity of the register was harold farrington he drifted into the exclusive and calm current of life in the lotus so tactfully and silently that not a ripple alarmed his fellow seekers after rest he ate in the lotus and of its patronym and was lulled into blissful peace with the other fortunate mariners in one day he acquired his table and his waiter and the fear lest the panting chasers after repose that kept broadway warm should pounce upon and destroy this contiguous but covert haven after dinner on the next day after the arrival of harold farrington madame beaumont dropped her handkerchief in passing out mr farrington recov ered and returned it without the effusiveness of a seeker after acquaintance perhaps there was a mystic freemasonry between the discriminating guests of the lotus perhaps they were drawn one to another by the fact of their common good fortune in discovering the acme of sum mer resorts in a broadway hotel words delicate in courtesy and tentative in departure from formality passed between the two and as if in the expedient atmosphere of a real summer resort an acquaintance grew flowered and fructified on the spot as does the mystic plant of the conjuror for a few moments they stood on a balcony upon which the corridor ended and tossed the feathery ball of conversation one tires of the old resorts said madame beau mont with a faint but sweet smile what is the use to fly to the mountains or the seashore to escape noise and dust when the very people that make both follow us there even on the ocean remarked farrington sadly the philistines be upon you the most exclusive steamers are getting to be scarcely more than ferry boats heaven help us when the summer resorter dis covers that the lotus is further away from broadway than thousand islands or mackinac i hope our secret will be safe for a week any how said madame with a sigh and a smile i do not know where i would go if they should descend upon the dear lotus i know of but one place so de lightful in summer and that is the castle of count polinski in the ural mountains i hear that baden baden and cannes are almost deserted this season said farrington year by year the old resorts fall in disrepute perhaps many others like ourselves are seeking out the quiet nooks that are overlooked by the majority i promise myself three days more of this delicious rest said madame beaumont on monday the cedric sails harold farrington s eyes proclaimed his regret i too must leave on monday he said but i do not go abroad madame beaumont shrugged one round shoulder in a foreign gesture one cannot bide here forever charming though it may be the chateau has been in preparation for me longer than a month those house parties that one must give what a nuisance but i shall never for get my week in the hotel lotus nor shall i said farrington in a low voice and i shall never forgive the cedric on sunday evening three days afterward the two sat at a little table on the same balcony a discreet waiter brought ices and small glasses of claret cup madame beaumont wore the same beautiful even ing gown that she had worn each day at dinner she seemed thoughtful near her hand on the table lay a small chatelaine purse after she had eaten her ice she opened the purse and took out a one dollar bill mr farrington she said with the smile that had won the hotel lotus i want to tell you some thing i m going to leave before breakfast in the morning because i ve got to go back to my work i m behind the hosiery counter at casey s mammoth store and my vacation s up at eight o clock to morrow that paper dollar is the last cent i ll see till i draw my eight dollars salary next saturday night you re a real gentleman and you ve been good to me and i wanted to tell you before i went i ve been saving up out of my wages for a year just for this vacation i wanted to spend one week like a lady if i never do another one i wanted to get up when i please instead of having to crawl out at seven every morning and i wanted to live on the best and be waited on and ring bells for things just like rich folks do now i ve done it and i ve had the happiest time i ever expect to have in my life i m going back to my work and my little hall bedroom satisfied for another year i wanted to tell you about it mr farrington because i i thought you kind of liked me and i i liked you but oh i couldn t help deceiving you up till now for it was all just like a fairy tale to me so i talked about europe and the things i ve read about in other countries and made you think i was a great lady this dress i ve got on it s the only one i have that s fit to wear i bought from o dowd levin sky on the instalment plan seventy five dollars is the price and it was made to measure i paid down and they re to collect a week till it s paid for that ll be about all i have to say mr farrington except that my name is mamie siviter instead of madame beaumont and i thank you for your attentions this dollar will pay the instalment due on the dress to morrow i guess i ll go up to my room now harold farrington listened to the recital of the lotus s loveliest guest with an impassive countenance when she had concluded he drew a small book like a checkbook from his coat pocket he wrote upon a blank form in this with a stub of pencil tore out the leaf tossed it over to his companion and took up the paper dollar i ve got to go to work too in the morning he said and i might as well begin now there s a receipt for the dollar instalment i ve been a col lector for o dowd levinsky for three years funny ain t it that you and me both had the same idea about spending our vacation i ve always wanted to put up at a swell hotel and i saved up out of my twenty per and did it say mame how about a trip to coney saturday night on the boat what the face of the pseudo madame heloise d arcy beaumont beamed oh you bet i ll go mr farrington the store closes at twelve on saturdays i guess coney ll be all right even if we did spend a week with the swells below the balcony the sweltering city growled and buzzed in the july night inside the hotel lotus the tempered cool shadows reigned and the solicitous waiter single footed near the low windows ready at a nod to serve madame and her escort at the door of the elevator farrington took his leave

it could be improved by introducing a messenger instead of a telephone call and cutting the dialogue just before the climax while they were struggling with the pistol and by completely changing the lines and business of helen grimes at the point where her jealousy overcomes her hart yielded to all her strictures without argument she had at once put her finger on the sketch s weaker points that was her woman s intuition that he had lacked at the end of their talk hart was willing to stake the judgment experience and savings of his four years of vaudeville that mice will play would blossom into a perennial flower in the garden of the circuits miss cherry was slower to decide after many puckerings of her smooth young brow and tappings on her small white teeth with the end of a lead pencil she gave out her dictum mr hart said she i believe your sketch is going to win out that grimes part fits me like a shrinkable flannel after its first trip to a handless hand laundry i can make it stand out like the colonel of the forty fourth regiment at a little mothers bazaar and i ve seen you work i know what you can do with the other part but business is business how much do you get a week for the stunt you do now two hundred answered hart i get one hundred for mine said cherry that s about the natural discount for a woman but i live on it and put a few simoleons every week under the loose brick in the old kitchen hearth the stage is all right i love it but there s something else i love better that s a little country home some day with plymouth rock chickens and six ducks wandering around the yard now let me tell you mr hart i am strictly business if you want me to play the opposite part in your sketch i ll do it and i believe we can make it go and there s something else i want to say there s no nonsense in my make up i m on the level and i m on the stage for what it pays me just as other girls work in stores and offices i m going to save my money to keep me when i m past doing my stunts no old ladies home or retreat for imprudent actresses for me if you want to make this a business partnership mr hart with all nonsense cut out of it i m in on it i know something about vaudeville teams in general but this would have to be one in particular i want you to know that i m on the stage for what i can cart away from it every pay day in a little manila envelope with nicotine stains on it where the cashier has licked the flap it s kind of a hobby of mine to want to cravenette myself for plenty of rainy days in the future i want you to know just how i am i don t know what an all night restaurant looks like i drink only weak tea i never spoke to a man at a stage entrance in my life and i ve got money in five savings banks miss cherry said bob hart in his smooth serious tones you re in on your own terms i ve got strictly business pasted in my hat and stenciled on my make up box when i dream of nights i always see a five room bungalow on the north shore of long island with a jap cooking clam broth and duckling in the kitchen and me with the title deeds to the place in my pongee coat pocket swinging in a hammock on the side porch reading stanleys explorations into africa and nobody else around you never was interested in africa was you miss cherry not any said cherry what i m going to do with my money is to bank it you can get four per cent on deposits even at the salary i ve been earning i ve figured out that in ten years i d have an income of about a month just from the interest alone well i might invest some of the principal in a little business say trimming hats or a beauty parlor and make more well said hart you ve got the proper idea all right all right anyhow there are mighty few actors that amount to anything at all who couldn t fix themselves for the wet days to come if they d save their money instead of blowing it i m glad you ve got the correct business idea of it miss cherry i think the same way and i believe this sketch will more than double what both of us earn now when we get it shaped up the subsequent history of mice will play is the history of all successful writings for the stage hart cherry cut it pieced it remodeled it performed surgical operations on the dialogue and business changed the lines restored em added more cut em out renamed it gave it back the old name rewrote it substituted a dagger for the pistol restored the pistol put the sketch through all the known processes of condensation and improvement they rehearsed it by the old fashioned boardinghouse clock in the rarely used parlor until its warning click at five minutes to the hour would occur every time exactly half a second before the click of the unloaded revolver that helen grimes used in rehearsing the thrilling climax of the sketch yes that was a thriller and a piece of excellent work in the act a real caliber revolver was used loaded with a real cartridge helen grimes who is a western girl of decidedly buffalo billish skill and daring is tempestuously in love with frank desmond the

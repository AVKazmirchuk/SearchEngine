man purchased a paper here in the last three months i said yes he replied we sold one last night can you describe the man accurately he had blue whiskers a wart between his shoulder blades a touch of colic and an occupation tax on his breath which way did he go out i then went wait a minute said the populist candidate rising i don t see why in the h once more i must beg that you will be silent said tictocq rather sharply you should not interrupt me in the midst of my report i made one false arrest continued tictocq i was passing two finely dressed gentlemen on the street when one of them remarked that he had stole his socks i handcuffed him and dragged him to a lighted store when his companion explained to me that he was somewhat intoxicated and his tongue was not entirely manageable he had been speaking of some business transaction and what he intended to say was that he had sold his stocks i then released him an hour afterward i passed a saloon and saw this professor von bum drinking beer at a table i knew him in paris i said here is my man he worshipped wagner lived on limburger cheese beer and credit and would have stolen anybody s socks i shadowed him to the reception at colonel st vitus s and in an opportune moment i seized him and tore the socks from his feet there they are with a dramatic gesture tictocq threw a pair of dingy socks upon the table folded his arms and threw back his head with a loud cry of rage the populist candidate sprang once more to his feet gol darn it i will say what i want to i the two other populists in the room gazed at him coldly and sternly is this tale true they demanded of the candidate no by gosh it ain t he replied pointing a trembling finger at the democratic chairman there stands the man who has concocted the whole scheme it is an infernal unfair political trick to lose votes for our party how far has thing gone he added turning savagely to the detective all the newspapers have my written report on the matter and the statesman will have it in plate matter next week said tictocq complacently all is lost said the populists turning toward the door for god s sake my friends pleaded the candidate following them listen to me i swear before high heaven that i never wore a pair of socks in my life it is all a devilish campaign lie the populists turn their backs the damage is already done they said the people have heard the story you have yet time to withdraw decently before the race all left the room except tictocq and the democrats let s all go down and open a bottle of fizz on the finance committee said the chairman of the executive committee platform no tracked to doom or the mystery of the rue de peychaud tis midnight in paris a myriad of lamps that line the champs elysees and the rouge et noir cast their reflection in the dark waters of the seine as it flows gloomily past the place vendome and the black walls of the convent notadam the great french capital is astir it is the hour when crime and vice and wickedness reign hundreds of fiacres drive madly through the streets conveying women flashing with jewels and as beautiful as dreams from opera and concert and the little bijou supper rooms of the cafe tout le temps are filled with laughing groups while bon mots persiflage and repartee fly upon the air the jewels of thought and conversation luxury and poverty brush each other in the streets the homeless gamin begging a sou with which to purchase a bed and the spendthrift roue scattering golden louis d or tread the same pavement when other cities sleep paris has just begun her wild revelry the first scene of our story is a cellar beneath the rue de peychaud the room is filled with smoke of pipes and is stifling with the reeking breath of its inmates a single flaring gas jet dimly lights the scene which is one rembrandt or moreland and keisel would have loved to paint a garcon is selling absinthe to such of the motley crowd as have a few sous dealing it out in niggardly portions in broken teacups leaning against the bar is carnaignole cusheau generally known as the gray wolf he is the worst man in paris he is more than four feet ten in height and his sharp ferocious looking face and the mass of long tangled gray hair that covers his face and head have earned for him the name he bears his striped blouse is wide open at the neck and falls outside of his dingy leather trousers the handle of a deadly looking knife protrudes from his belt one stroke of its blade would open a box of the finest french sardines voila gray wolf cries couteau the bartender how many victims to day there is no blood upon your hands has the gray wolf forgotten how to bite sacre bleu mille tonnerre by george hisses the gray wolf monsieur couteau you are bold indeed to speak to

country with their income tax and their free trade they have destroyed the millionaire business carrambo diable d n it hist suddenly says chamounix the rag picker who is worth francs some one comes the cellar door opened and a man crept softly down the rickety steps the crowd watches him with silent awe he went to the bar laid his card on the counter bought a drink of absinthe and then drawing from his pocket a little mirror set it up on the counter and proceeded to don a false beard and hair and paint his face into wrinkles until he closely resembled an old man seventy one years of age he then went into a dark corner and watched the crowd of people with sharp ferret like eyes gray wolf slipped cautiously to the bar and examined the card left by the newcomer holy saint bridget he exclaims it is tictocq the detective ten minutes later a beautiful woman enters the cellar tenderly nurtured and accustomed to every luxury that money could procure she had when a young vivandiere at the convent of saint susan de la montarde run away with the gray wolf fascinated by his many crimes and the knowledge that his business never allowed him to scrape his feet in the hall or snore parbleu marie snarls the gray wolf que voulez vous avez vous le beau cheval de mon frere oule joli chien de votre pere no no gray wolf shouts the motley group of assassins rogues and pickpockets even their hardened hearts appalled at his fearful words mon dieu you cannot be so cruel tiens shouts the gray wolf now maddened to desperation and drawing his gleaming knife voila canaille tout le monde carte blanche enbonpoint sauve que peut entre nous revenez nous a nous moutons the horrifed sans culottes shrink back in terror as the gray wolf seizes maria by the hair and cuts her into twenty nine pieces each exactly the same size as he stands with reeking hands above the corpse amid a deep silence the old gray bearded man who has been watching the scene springs forward tears off his false beard and locks and tictocq the famous french detective stands before them spellbound and immovable the denizens of the cellar gaze at the greatest modern detective as he goes about the customary duties of his office he first measures the distance from the murdered woman to a point on the wall then he takes down the name of the bartender and the day of the month and the year then drawing from his pocket a powerful microscope he examines a little of the blood that stands upon the floor in little pools mon dieu he mutters it is as i feared human blood he then enters rapidly in a memorandum book the result of his investigations and leaves the cellar tictocq bends his rapid steps in the direction of the headquarters of the paris gendarmerie but suddenly pausing he strikes his hand upon his brow with a gesture of impatience mille tonnerre he mutters i should have asked the name of that man with the knife in his hand it is reception night at the palace of the duchess valerie du bellairs the apartments are flooded with a mellow light from paraffine candles in solid silver candelabra the company is the most aristocratic and wealthy in paris three or four brass bands are playing behind a portiere between the coal shed and also behind time footmen in gay laced livery bring in beer noiselessly and carry out apple peelings dropped by the guests valerie seventh duchess du bellairs leans back on a solid gold ottoman on eiderdown cushions surrounded by the wittiest the bravest and the handsomest courtiers in the capital ah madame said the prince champvilliers of palms royale corner of seventy third street as montesquiaux says rien de plus bon tutti frutti youth seems your inheritance you are to night the most beautiful the wittiest in your own salon i can scarce believe my own senses when i remember that thirty one years ago you saw it off says the duchess peremptorily the prince bows low and drawing a jewelled dagger stabs himself to the heart the displeasure of your grace is worse than death he says as he takes his overcoat and hat from a corner of the mantelpiece and leaves the room voila says beebe francillon fanning herself languidly that is the way with men flatter them and they kiss your hand loose but a moment the silken leash that holds them captive through their vanity and self opinionativeness and the son of a gun gets on his ear at once the devil go with him i say ah mon princesse sighs the count pumpernickel stooping and whispering with eloquent eyes into her ear you are too hard upon us balzac says all women are not to themselves what no one else is to another do you not agree with him cheese it says the princess philosophy palls upon me i ll shake you hosses says the count arm and arm they go out to the salon au beurre armande de fleury the young pianissimo danseuse from the folies bergere is about to sing she slightly clears her throat and lays a voluptuous cud of chewing gum upon the piano as the first notes of the accompaniment ring through the salon as she prepares to sing the duchess du bellairs grasps the arm of her ottoman in a vice like grip and she watches with an expression of almost anguished suspense she scarcely breathes then as armande de fleury before uttering a note reels wavers turns white as snow and falls dead upon the floor the duchess breathes a sigh of relief the duchess had poisoned her then the guests crowd about the piano gazing with bated breath and shuddering as they look upon the music rack and observe that the song that armande came so near singing is sweet marie twenty minutes later a dark and muffled figure was seen to emerge from a recess in the mullioned wall of the arc de triomphe and pass rapidly northward it was no other than tictocq the detective the network of evidence was fast being drawn about the murderer of marie cusheau it is midnight on the steeple of the cathedral of notadam it is also the same time at other given points in the vicinity the spire of the cathedral is feet above the pavement and a casual observer by making a rapid mathematical calculation would have readily perceived that this cathedral is at least double the height of others that measure only feet at the summit of the spire there is a little wooden platform on which there is room for but one man to stand crouching on this precarious footing which swayed dizzily with every breeze that blew was a man closely muffled and disguised as a wholesale grocer old francois beongfallong the great astronomer who is studying the sidereal spheres from his attic window in the rue de bologny shudders as he turns his telescope upon the solitary figure upon the spire sacre bleu he hisses between his new celluloid teeth it is tictocq the detective i wonder whom he is following now while tictocq is watching with lynx like eyes the hill of montmartre he suddenly hears a heavy breathing beside him and turning gazes into the ferocious eyes of the gray wolf carnaignole cusheau had put on his w u tel co climbers and climbed the steeple parbleu monsieur says tictocq to whom am i indebted for the honor of this visit the gray wolf smiled softly and depreciatingly you are tictocq the detective he said i am then listen i am the murderer of marie cusheau she was my wife and she had cold feet and ate onions what was i to do yet life is sweet to me i do not wish to be guillotined i have heard that you are on my track is it true that the case is in your hands it is thank le bon dieu then i am saved the gray wolf carefully adjusts the climbers on his feet and descends the spire tictocq takes out his notebook and writes in it at last he says i have a clue monsieur le compte carnaignole cusheau once known as the gray wolf stands in the magnificent drawing room of his palace on east th street three days after his confession to tictocq he happened to look in the pockets of a discarded pair of pants and found twenty million francs in gold suddenly the door opens and tictocq the detective with a dozen gensd arme enters the room you are my prisoner says the detective on what charge the murder of marie cusheau on the night of august th your proofs i saw you do it and your own confession on the spire of notadam the count laughed and took a paper from his pocket read this he said here is proof that marie cusheau died of heart failure tictocq looked at the paper it was a check for francs tictocq dismissed the gensd arme with a wave of his hand we have made a mistake monsieurs he said but as he turns to leave the room count carnaignole stops him one moment monsieur the count carnaignole tears from his own face a false beard and reveals the flashing eyes and well known features of tictocq the detective then springing forward he snatches a wig and false eyebrows from his visitor and the gray wolf grinding his teeth in rage stands before him the murderer of marie cusheau was never discovered a snapshot at the president this is the kind of waggish editorial o henry was writing in for the readers of the rolling stone the reader will do well to remember that the paper was for local consumption and that the allusions are to a very special place and time it will be remembered that about a month ago there were special rates offered to the public for a round trip to the city of washington the price of the ticket being exceedingly low we secured a loan of twenty dollars from a public spirited citizen of austin by mortgaging our press and cow with the additional security of our brother s name and a slight draught on major hutchinson for we purchased a round trip ticket two loaves of vienna bread and quite a large piece of cheese which we handed to a member of our reportorial staff with instructions to go to washington interview president cleveland and get a scoop if possible on all other texas papers our reporter came in yesterday morning via the manor dirt road with a large piece of folded cotton bagging tied under each foot it seems that he lost his ticket in washington and having divided the vienna bread and cheese with some disappointed office seekers who were coming home by the same route he arrived home hungry desiring food and with quite an appetite although somewhat late we give his description of his interview with president cleveland i am chief reporter on the staff of the rolling stone about a month ago the managing editor came into the room where we were both sitting engaged in conversation and said oh by the way go to washington and interview president cleveland all right said i take care of yourself five minutes later i was seated in a palatial drawing room car bounding up and down quite a good deal on the elastic plush covered seat i shall not linger upon the incidents of the journey i was given carte blanche to provide myself with every comfort and to spare no expense that i could meet for the regalement of my inside the preparations had been lavish both vienna and germany had been called upon to furnish dainty viands suitable to my palate i changed cars and shirts once only on the journey a stranger wanted me to also change a two dollar bill but i haughtily declined the scenery along the entire road to washington is diversified you find a portion of it on one hand by looking out of the window and upon turning the gaze upon the other side the eye is surprised and delighted by discovering some more of it there were a great many knights of pythias on the train one of them insisted upon my giving him the grip i had with me but he was unsuccessful on arriving in washington which city i instantly recognized from reading the history of george i left the car so hastily that i forgot to fee mr pullman s representative i went immediately to the capitol in a spirit of jeu d esprit i had had made a globular representation of a rolling stone it was of wood painted a dark color and about the size of a small cannon ball i had attached to it a twisted pendant about three inches long to indicate moss i had resolved to use this in place of a card thinking people would readily recognize it as an emblem of my paper i had studied the arrangement of the capitol and walked directly to mr cleveland s private office i met a servant in the hall and held up my card to him smilingly i saw his hair rise on his head and he ran like a deer to the door and lying down rolled down the long flight of steps into the yard ah said i to myself he is one of our delinquent subscribers a little farther along i met the president s private secretary who had been writing a tariff letter and cleaning a duck gun for mr cleveland when i showed him the emblem of my paper he sprang out of a high window into a hothouse filled with rare flowers this somewhat surprised me i examined myself my hat was on straight and there was nothing at all alarming about my appearance i went into the president s private office he was alone he was conversing with tom ochiltree mr ochiltree saw my little sphere and with a loud scream rushed out of the room president cleveland slowly turned his eyes upon me he also saw what i had in my hand and said in a husky voice wait a moment please he searched his coat pocket and presently found a piece of paper on which some words were written he laid this on his desk and rose to his feet raised one hand above him and said in deep tones i die for free trade my country and and all that sort of thing i saw him jerk a string and a camera snapped on another table taking our picture as we stood don t die in the house mr president i said go over into the senate chamber peace murderer he said let your bomb do its deadly work i m no bum i said with spirit i represent the rolling stone of austin texas and this i hold in my hand does the same thing but it seems unsuccessfully the president sank back in his chair greatly relieved i thought you were a dynamiter he said let me see texas texas he walked to a large wall map of the united states and placing his finger thereon at about the location of idaho ran it down in a zigzag doubtful way until he reached texas oh yes here it is i have so many things on my mind i sometimes forget what i should know well let s see texas oh yes that s the state where ida wells and a lot of colored people lynched a socialist named hogg for raising a riot at a camp meeting so you are from texas i know a man from texas named dave culberson how is dave and his family has dave got any children he has a boy in austin i said working around the capitol who is president of texas now i don t exactly oh excuse me i forgot again i thought i heard some talk of its having been made a republic again now mr cleveland i said you answer some of my questions a curious film came over the president s eyes he sat stiffly in his chair like an automaton proceed he said what do you think of the political future of this country i will state that political exigencies demand emergentistical promptitude and while the united states is indissoluble in conception and invisible in intent treason and internecine disagreement have ruptured the consanguinity of patriotism and one moment mr president i interrupted would you mind changing that cylinder i could have gotten all that from the american press association if i had wanted plate matter do you wear flannels what is your favorite poet brand of catsup bird flower and what are you going to do when you are out of a job young man said mr cleveland sternly you are going a little too far my private affairs do not concern the public i begged his pardon and he recovered his good humor in a moment you texans have a great representative in senator mills he said i think the greatest two speeches i ever heard were his address before the senate advocating the removal of the tariff on salt and increasing it on chloride of sodium tom ochiltree is also from our state i said oh no he isn t you must be mistaken replied mr cleveland for he says he is i really must go down to texas some time and see the state i want to go up into the panhandle and see if it is really shaped like it is on the map well i must be going said i when you get back to texas said the president rising you must write to me your visit has awakened in me quite an interest in your state which i fear i have not given the attention it deserves there are many historical and otherwise interesting places that you have revived in my recollection the alamo where davy jones fell goliad sam houston s surrender to montezuma the petrified boom found near austin five cent cotton and the siamese democratic platform born in dallas i should so much like to see the gals in galveston and go to the wake in waco i am glad i met you turn to the left as you enter the hall and keep straight on out i made a low bow to signify that the interview was at an end and withdrew immiediately i had no difficulty in leaving the building as soon as i was outside i hurried downtown in order to obtain refreshments at some place where viands had been placed upon the free list i shall not describe my journey back to austin i lost my return ticket somewhere in the white house and was forced to return home in a manner not especially beneficial to my shoes everybody was well in washington when i left and all send their love an unfinished christmas story probably begun several years before his death published as it here appears in short stories january now a christmas story should be one for a good many years the ingenious writers have been putting forth tales for the holiday numbers that employed every subtle evasive indirect and strategic scheme they could invent to disguise the christmas flavor so far has this new practice been carried that nowadays when you read a story in a holiday magazine the only way you can tell it is a christmas story is to look at the footnote which reads the incidents in the above story happened on december th ed there is progress in this but it is all very sad there are just as many real christmas stories as ever if we would only dig em up me i am for the scrooge and marley christmas story and the annie and willie s prayer poem and the long lost son coming home on the stroke of twelve to the poorly thatched cottage with his arms full of talking dolls and popcorn balls and zip you hear the second mortgage on the cottage go flying off it into the deep snow so this is to warn you that there is no subterfuge about this story and you might come upon stockings hung to the mantel and plum puddings and hark the chimes and wealthy misers loosening up and handing over penny whistles to lame newsboys if you read further once i knocked at a door i have so many things to tell you i keep on losing sight of the story it was the front door of a furnished room house in west teenth street i was looking for a young illustrator named paley originally and irrevocably from terre haute paley doesn t enter even into the first serial rights of this christmas story i mention him simply in explaining why i came to knock at the door some people have so much curiosity the door was opened by the landlady i had seen hundreds like her and i had smelled before that cold dank furnished draught of air that hurried by her to escape immurement in the furnished house she was stout and her face and lands were as white as though she had been drowned in a barrel of vinegar one hand held together at her throat a buttonless flannel dressing sacque whose lines had been cut by no tape or butterick known to mortal woman beneath this a too long flowered black sateen skirt was draped about her reaching the floor in stiff wrinkles and folds the rest of her was yellow her hair in some bygone age had been dipped in the fountain of folly presided over by the merry nymph hydrogen but now except at the roots it had returned to its natural grim and grizzled white her eyes and teeth and finger nails were yellow her chops hung low and shook when she moved the look on her face was exactly that smileless look of fatal melancholy that you may have seen on the countenance of a hound left sitting on the doorstep of a deserted cabin i inquired for paley after a long look of cold suspicion the landlady spoke and her voice matched the dingy roughness of her flannel sacque paley was i sure that was the name and wasn t it likely mr sanderson i meant in the third floor rear no it was paley i wanted again that frozen shrewd steady study of my soul from her pale yellow unwinking eyes trying to penetrate my mask of deception and rout out my true motives from my lying lips there was a mr tompkins in the front hall bedroom two flights up perhaps it was he i was seeking he worked of nights he never came in till seven in the morning or if it was really mr tucker thinly disguised as paley that i was hunting i would have to call between five and but no i held firmly to paley there was no such name among her lodgers click the door closed swiftly in my face and i heard through the panels the clanking of chains and bolts i went down the steps and stopped to consider the number of this house was i was sure paley had said or perhaps it was or i decided to try the second house farther along i rang the bell the door opened and there stood the same woman i wasn t confronted by just a resemblance it was the same woman holding together the same old sacque at her throat and looking at me with the same yellow eyes as if she had never seen me before on earth i saw on the knuckle of her second finger the same red and black spot made probably by a recent burn against a hot stove i stood speechless and gaping while one with moderate haste might have told fifty i couldn t have spoken paley s name even if i had remembered it i did the only thing that a brave man who believes there are mysterious forces in nature that we do not yet fully comprehend could have done in the circumstances i backed down the steps to the sidewalk and then hurried away frontward fully understanding how incidents like that must bother the psychical research people and the census takers of course i heard an explanation of it afterward as we always do about inexplicable things the landlady was mrs kannon and she leased three adjoining houses which she made into one by cutting arched doorways through the walls she sat in the middle house and answered the three bells i wonder why i have maundered so slowly through the prologue i have it it was simply to say to you in the form of introduction rife through the middle west shake hands with mrs kannon for it was in her triple house that the christmas story happened and it was there where i picked up the incontrovertible facts from the gossip of many roomers and met stickney and saw the necktie christmas came that year on thursday and snow came with it stickney harry clarence fowler stickney to whomsoever his full baptismal cognominal burdens may be of interest reached his address at six thirty wednesday afternoon address is new yorkese for home stickney roomed at west teenth street third floor rear hall room he was twenty years and four months old and he worked in a cameras of all kinds photographic supplies and films developed store i don t know what kind of work he did in the store but you must have seen him he is the young man who always comes behind the counter to wait on you and lets you talk for five minutes telling him what you want when you are done he calls the proprietor at the top of his voice to wait on you and walks away whistling between his teeth i don t want to bother about describing to you his appearance but if you are a man reader i will say that stickncy looked precisely like the young chap that you always find sitting in your chair smoking a cigarette after you have missed a shot while playing pool not billiards but pool when you want to sit down yourself there are some to whom christmas gives no christmassy essence of course prosperous people and comfortable people who have homes or flats or rooms with meals and even people who live in apartment houses with hotel service get something of the christmas flavor they give one another presents with the cost mark scratched off with a penknife and they hang holly wreaths in the front windows and when they are asked whether they prefer light or dark meat from the turkey they say both please and giggle and have lots of fun and the very poorest people have the best time of it the army gives em a dinner and the a m issue of the night final edition of the newspaper with the largest circulation in the city leaves a basket at their door full of an apple a lake ronkonkoma squab a scrambled eggplant and a bunch of kalamazoo bleached parsley the poorer you are the more christmas does for you but i ll tell you to what kind of a mortal christmas seems to be only the day before the twenty sixth day of december it s the chap in the big city earning sixteen dollars a week with no friends and few acquaintances who finds himself with only fifty cents in his pocket on christmas eve he can t accept charity he can t borrow he knows no one who would invite him to dinner i have a fancy that when the shepherds left their flocks to follow the star of bethlehem there was a bandy legged young fellow among them who was just learning the sheep business so they said to him bobby we re going to investigate this star route and see what s in it if it should turn out to be the first christmas day we don t want to miss it and as you are not a wise man and as you couldn t possibly purchase a present to take along suppose you stay behind and mind the sheep so as we may say harry stickney was a direct descendant of the shepherd who was left behind to take care of the flocks getting back to facts stickney rang the doorbell of he had a habit of forgetting his latchkey instantly the door opened and there stood mrs kannon clutching her sacque together at the throat and gorgonizing him with her opaque yellow eyes to give you good measure here is a story within a story once a roomer in who had the scotch habit not kilts but a habit of drinking scotch began to figure to himself what might happen if two persons should ring the doorbells of and at the same time visions of two halves of mrs kannon appearing respectively and simultaneously at the two entrances each clutching at a side of an open flapping sacque that could never meet overpowered him bellevue got him evening said stickney cheerlessly as he distributed little piles of muddy slush along the hall matting think we ll have snow you left your key said here the manuscript ends the unprofitable servant left unfinished and published as it here appears in everybody s magazine december i am the richer by the acquaintance of four newspaper men singly they are my encyclopedias friends mentors and sometimes bankers but now and then it happens that all of them will pitch upon the same printworthy incident of the passing earthly panorama and will send in reportorial constructions thereof to their respective journals it is then that for me it is to laugh for it seems that to each of them trained and skilled as he may be the same occurrence presents a different facet of the cut diamond life one will have it let us say that mme andre macarte s apartment was looted by six burglars who descended via the fire escape and bore away a ruby tiara valued at two thousand dollars and a five hundred dollar prize spitz dog which in violation of the expectoration ordinance was making free with the halls of the wuttapesituckquesunoowetunquah apartments my second chiel will take notes to the effect that while a friendly game of pinochle was in progress in the tenement rooms of mrs andy mccarty a lady guest named ruby o hara threw a burglar down six flights of stairs where he was pinioned and held by a two thousand dollar english bulldog amid a crowd of five hundred excited spectators my third chronicler and friend will gather the news threads of the happening in his own happy way setting forth on the page for you to read that the house of antonio macartini was blown up at a m by the black hand society on his refusing to leave two thousand dollars at a certain street corner killing a pet five hundred dollar pomeranian belonging to alderman rubitara s little daughter see photo and diagram opposite number four of my history makers will simply construe from the premises the story that while an audience of two thousand enthusiasts was listening to a rubinstein concert on sixth street a woman who said she was mrs andrew m carter threw a brick through a plate glass window valued at five hundred dollars the carter woman claimed that some one in the building had stolen her dog now the discrepancies in these registrations of the day s doings need do no one hurt surely one newspaper is enough for any man to prop against his morning water bottle to fend off the smiling hatred of his wife s glance if he be foolish enough to read four he is no wiser than a higher critic i remember probably as well as you do having read the parable of the talents a prominent citizen about to journey into a far country first hands over to his servants his goods to one he gives five talents to another two to another one to every man according to his several ability as the text has it there are two versions of this parable as you well know there may be more i do not know when the p c returns he requires an accounting two servants have put their talents out at usury and gained one hundred per cent good the unprofitable one simply digs up the talent deposited with him and hands it out on demand a pattern of behavior for trust companies and banks surely in one version we read that he had wrapped it in a napkin and laid it away but the commentator informs us that the talent mentioned was composed of ounces of silver about worth so the chronicler who mentioned the napkin had either to reduce the amount of the deposit or do a lot of explaining about the size of the napery used in those davs therefore in his version we note that he uses the word pound instead of talent a pound of silver may very well be laid away and carried away in a napkin as any hotel or restaurant man will tell you but let us get away from our mutton when the returned nobleman finds that the one talented servant has nothing to hand over except the original fund entrusted to him he is as angry as a multi millionaire would be if some one should hide under his bed and make a noise like an assessment he orders the unprofitable servant cast into outer darkness after first taking away his talent and giving it to the one hundred per cent financier and breathing strange saws saying from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath which is the same as to say nothing from nothing leaves nothing and now closer draw the threads of parable precept allegory and narrative leading nowhere if you will or else weaving themselves into the little fiction story about cliff mcgowan and his one talent there is but a definition to follow and then the homely actors trip on talent a gift endowment or faculty some peculiar ability power or accomplishment natural or acquired a metaphor borrowed from the parable in matt xxv l in new york city to day there are estimated living creatures training for the stage this does not include seals pigs dogs elephants prize fighters carmens mind readers or japanese wrestlers the bulk of

mac mcgowan were cousins they lived on the west side and were talented singing dancing imitations trick bicycle riding boxing german and irish dialect comedy and a little sleight of hand and balancing of wheat straws and wheelbarrows on the ends of their chins came as easy to them as it is for you to fix your rat so it won t show or to dodge a creditor through the swinging doors of a well lighted cafe according as you may belong to the one or the other division of the greatest prestidigitators the people they were slim pale consummately self possessed youths whose fingernails were always irreproachably and clothes seams reproachfully shiny their conversation was in sentences so short that they made kipling s seem as long as court citations having the temperament they did no work any afternoon you could find them on eighth avenue either in front of spinelli s barber shop mike dugan s place or the limerick hotel rubbing their forefinger nails with dingy silk handkerchiefs at any time if you had happened to be standing undecisive near a pool table and cliff and mac had casually as it were drawn near mentioning something disinterestedly about a game well indeed would it have been for you had you gone your way unresponsive which assertion carefully considered is a study in tense punctuation and advice to strangers of all kinships it is likely that the closest is that of cousin between cousins there exist the ties of race name and favor ties thicker than water and yet not coagulated with the jealous precipitations of brotherhood or the enjoining obligations of the matrimonial yoke you can bestow upon a cousin almost the interest and affection that you would give to a stranger you need not feel toward him the contempt and embarrassment that you have for one of your father s sons it is the closer clan feeling that sometimes makes the branch of a tree stronger than its trunk thus were the two mcgowans bonded they enjoyed a quiet celebrity in their district which was a strip west of eighth avenue with the pump for its pivot their talents were praised in a hundred joints their friendship was famed even in a neighborhood where men had been known to fight off the wives of their friends when domestic onslaught was being made upon their friends by the wives of their friends thus do the limitations of english force us to repetends so side by side grim sallow lowering inseparable undefeated the cousins fought their way into the temple of art art with a big a which causes to intervene a lesson in geometry one night at about eleven o clock del delano dropped into mike s place on eighth avenue from that moment instead of remaining a place the cafe became a resort it was as though king edward had condescended to mingle with ten spots of a different suit or joe gans had casually strolled in to look over the tuskegee school or mr shaw of england had accepted an invitation to read selections from rena the snow bird at an unveiling of the proposed monument to james owen o connor at chinquapin falls mississippi in spite of these comparisons you will have to be told why the patronizing of a third rate saloon on the west side by the said del delano conferred such a specific honor upon the place del delano could not make his feet behave and so the world paid him a week to see them misconduct themselves on the vaudeville stage to make the matter plain to you and to swell the number of words he was the best fancy dancer on any of the circuits between ottawa and corpus christi with his eyes fixed on vacancy and his feet apparently fixed on nothing he nightly charmed thousands as his press agent incorrectly stated even taking night performance and matinee together he scarcely could have charmed more than eighteen hundred including those who left after zora the nautch girl had squeezed herself through a hoop twelve inches in diameter and those who were waiting for the moving pictures but del delano was the west side s favorite and nowhere is there a more loyal side five years before our story was submitted to the editors del had crawled from some tenth avenue basement like a lean rat and had bitten his way into the big cheese patched half starved cuffless and as scornful of the hook as an interpreter of ibsen he had danced his way into health as you and i view it and fame in sixteen minutes on amateur night at creary s variety theatre in eighth avenue a bookmaker one of the kind that talent wins with instead of losing sat in the audience asleep dreaming of an impossible pick up among the amateurs after a snore a glass of beer from the handsome waiter and a temporary blindness caused by the diamonds of a transmontane blonde in box e the bookmaker woke up long enough to engage del delano for a three weeks trial engagement fused with a trained dog short circuit covering the three washingtons heights statue and square by the time this story was read and accepted del delano was drawing his three hundred dollars a week which divided by seven sunday acts not in costume being permissible dispels the delusion entertained by most of us that we have seen better days you can easily imagine the worshipful agitation of eighth avenue whenever del delano honored it with a visit after his terpsichorean act in a historically great and vilely ventilated broadway theatre if the west side could claim forty two minutes out of his forty two weeks bookings every year it was an occasion for bonfires and repainting of the pump and now you know why mike s saloon is a resort and no longer a simple place del delano entered mike s alone so nearly concealed in a fur lined overcoat and a derby two sizes too large for him was prince lightfoot that you saw of his face only his pale hatchet edged features and a pair of unwinking cold light blue eyes nearly every man lounging at mike s bar recognized the renowned product of the west side to those who did not wisdom was conveyed by prodding elbows and growls of one sided introduction upon charley one of the bartenders both fame and fortune descended simultaneously he had once been honored by shaking hands with the great delano at a seventh avenue boxing bout so with lungs of brass he now cried hallo del old man what ll it be mike the proprietor who was cranking the cash register heard on the next day he raised charley s wages five a week del delano drank a pony beer paying for it carelessly out of his nightly earnings of and c he nodded amiably but coldly at the long line of mike s patrons and strolled past then into the rear room of the cafe for he heard in there sounds pertaining to his own art the light stirring staccato of a buck and wing dance in the back room mac mcgowan was giving a private exhibition of the genius of his feet a few young men sat at tables looking on critically while they amused themselves seriously with beer they nodded approval at some new fancy steps of mac s own invention at the sight of the great del delano the amateur s feet stuttered blundered clicked a few times and ceased to move the tongues of one s shoes become tied in the presence of the master mac s sallow face took on a slight flush from the uncertain cavity between del delano s hat brim and the lapels of his high fur coat collar came a thin puff of cigarette smoke and then a voice do that last step over again kid and don t hold your arms quite so stiff now then once more mac went through his paces according to the traditions of the man dancer his entire being was transformed into mere feet and legs his gaze and expression became cataleptic his body unbending above the waist but as light as a cork bobbed like the same cork dancing on the ripples of a running brook the beat of his heels and toes pleased you like a snare drum obligato the performance ended with an amazing clatter of leather against wood that culminated in a sudden flat footed stamp leaving the dancer erect and as motionless as a pillar of the colonial portico of a mansion in a kentucky prohibition town mac felt that he had done his best and that del delano would turn his back upon him in derisive scorn an approximate silence followed broken only by the mewing of a cafe cat and the hubbub and uproar of a few million citizens and transportation facilities outside mac turned a hopeless but nervy eye upon del delano s face in it he read disgust admiration envy indifference approval disappointment praise and contempt thus in the countenances of those we hate or love we find what we most desire or fear to see which is an assertion equalling in its wisdom and chiaroscuro the most famous sayings of the most foolish philosophers that the world has ever known del delano retired within his overcoat and hat in two minutes he emerged and turned his left side to mac then he spoke you ve got a foot movement kid like a baby hippopotamus trying to side step a jab from a humming bird and you hold yourself like a truck driver having his picture taken in a third avenue photograph gallery and you haven t got any method or style and your knees are about as limber as a couple of yale pass keys and you strike the eye as weighing let us say pounds while you work but say would you mind giving me your name mcgowan said the humbled amateur mac mcgowan delano the great slowly lighted a cigarette and continued through its smoke in other words you re rotten you can t dance but i ll tell you one thing you ve got throw it all off of your system while you re at it said mac what ve i got genius said del delano except myself it s up to you to be the best fancy dancer in the united states europe asia and the colonial possessions of all three smoke up said mac mcgowan genius repeated the master you ve got a talent for genius your brains are in your feet where a dancer s ought to be you ve been self taught until you re almost ruined but not quite what you need is a trainer i ll take you in hand and put you at the top of the profession there s room there for the two of us you may beat me said the master casting upon him a cold savage look combining so much rivalry affection justice and human hate that it stamped him at once as one of the little great ones of the earth you may beat me but i doubt it i ve got the start and the pull but at the top is where you belong your name you say is robinson mcgowan repeated the amateur mac mcgowan it don t matter said delano suppose you walk up to my hotel with me i d like to talk to you your footwork is the worst i ever saw madigan but well i d like to talk to you you may not think so but i m not so stuck up i came off of the west side myself that overcoat cost me eight hundred dollars but the collar ain t so high but what i can see over it i taught myself to dance and i put in most of nine years at it before i shook a foot in public but i had genius i didn t go too far wrong in teaching myself as you ve done you ve got the rottenest method and style of anybody i ever saw oh i don t think much of the few little steps i take said mac with hypocritical lightness don t talk like a package of self raising buckwheat flour said del delano you ve had a talent handed to you by the proposition higher up and it s up to you to do the proper thing with it i d like to have you go up to my hotel for a talk if you will in his rooms in the king clovis hotel del delano put on a scarlet house coat bordered with gold braid and set out apollinaris and a box of sweet crackers mac s eye wandered forget it said del drink and tobacco may be all right for a man who makes his living with his hands but they won t do if you re depending on your head or your feet if one end of you gets tangled so does the other that s why beer and cigarettes don t hurt piano players and picture painters but you ve got to cut em out if you want to do mental or pedal work now have a cracker and then we ll talk some all right said mac i take it as an honor of course for you to notice my hopping around of course i d like to do something in a professional line of course i can sing a little and do card tricks and irish and german comedy stuff and of course i m not so bad on the trapeze and comic bicycle stunts and hebrew monologues and one moment interrupted del delano before we begin i said you couldn t dance well that wasn t quite right you ve only got two or three bad tricks in your method you re handy with your feet and you belong at the top where i am i ll put you there i ve got six weeks continuous in new york and in four i can shape up your style till the booking agents will fight one another to get you and i ll do it too i m of from and for the west side del delano looks good on bill boards but the family name s crowley now mackintosh mcgowan i mean you ve got your chance fifty times a better one than i had i d be a shine to turn it down said mac and i hope you understand i appreciate it me and my cousin cliff mcgowan was thinking of getting a try out at creary s on amateur night a month from to morrow good stuff said delano i got mine there junius t rollins the booker for kuhn dooley jumped on the stage and engaged me after my dance and the boards were an inch deep in nickels and dimes and quarters there wasn t but nine penny pieces found in the lot i ought to tell you said mac after two minutes of pensiveness that my cousin cliff can beat me dancing we ve always been what you might call pals if you d take him up instead of me now it might be better he s invented a lot of steps that i can t cut forget it said delano mondays wednesdays fridays and saturdays of every week from now till amateur night a month off i ll coach you i ll make you as good as i am and nobody could do more for you my act s over every night at half an hour later i ll take you up and drill you till twelve i ll put you at the top of the bunch right where i am you ve got talent your style s bum but you ve got the genius you let me manage it i m from the west side myself and i d rather see one of the same gang win out before i would an east sider or any of the flatbush or hackensack meadow kind of butt iners i ll see that junius rollins is present on your friday night and if he don t climb over the footlights and offer you fifty a week as a starter i ll let you draw it down from my own salary every monday night now am i talking on the level or am i not amateur night at creary s eighth avenue theatre is cut by the same pattern as amateur nights elsewhere after the regular performance the humblest talent may by previous arrangement with the management make its debut upon the public stage ambitious non professionals mostly self instructed display their skill and powers of entertainment along the broadest lines they may sing dance mimic juggle contort recite or disport themselves along any of the ragged boundary lines of art from the ranks of these anxious tyros are chosen the professionals that adorn or otherwise make conspicuous the full blown stage press agents delight in recounting to open mouthed and close eared reporters stories of the humble beginnings of the brilliant stars whose orbits they control such and such a prima donna they will tell you made her initial bow to the public while turning handsprings on an amateur night one great matinee favorite made his debut on a generous friday evening singing coon songs of his own composition a tragedian famous on two continents and an island first attracted attention by an amateur impersonation of a newly landed scandinavian peasant girl one broadway comedian that turns em away got a booking on a friday night by reciting seriously the graveyard scene in hamlet thus they get their chance amateur night is a kindly boon it is charity divested of almsgiving it is a brotherly hand reached down

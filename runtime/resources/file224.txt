andy to catch the b o westbound grab your baggage what s the hurry says i it was a square deal and even if it was only an imitation of the original carving it ll take him some time to find it out he seemed to be sure it was the genuine article it was says andy it was his own when i was looking at his curios yesterday he stepped out of the room for a moment and i pocketed it now will you pick up your suit case and hurry then says i why was that story about finding another one in the pawn oh says andy out of respect for that conscience of yours come on the man higher up across our two dishes of spaghetti in a corner of provenzano s restaurant jeff peters was explaining to me the three kinds of graft every winter jeff comes to new york to eat spaghetti to watch the shipping in east river from the depths of his chinchilla overcoat and to lay in a supply of chicago made clothing at one of the fulton street stores during the other three seasons he may be found further west his range is from spokane to tampa in his profession he takes a pride which he supports and defends with a serious and unique philosophy of ethics his profession is no new one he is an incorporated uncapitalized unlimited asylum for the reception of the restless and unwise dollars of his fellowmen in the wilderness of stone in which jeff seeks his annual lonely holiday he is glad to palaver of his many adventures as a boy will whistle after sundown in a wood wherefore i mark on my calendar the time of his coming and open a question of privilege at provenzano s concerning the little wine stained table in the corner between the rakish rubber plant and the framed palazzio della something on the wall there are two kinds of graft said jeff that ought to be wiped out by law i mean wall street speculation and burglary nearly everybody will agree with you as to one of them said i with a laugh well burglary ought to be wiped out too said jeff and i wondered whether the laugh had been redundant about three months ago said jeff it was my privilege to become familiar with a sample of each of the aforesaid branches of illegitimate art i was sine qua grata with a member of the housebreakers union and one of the john d napoleons of finance at the same time interesting combination said i with a yawn did i tell you i bagged a duck and a ground squirrel at one shot last week over in the ramapos i knew well how to draw jeff s stories let me tell you first about these barnacles that clog the wheels of society by poisoning the springs of rectitude with their upas like eye said jeff with the pure gleam of the muck raker in his own as i said three months ago i got into bad company there are two times in a man s life when he does this when he s dead broke and when he s rich now and then the most legitimate business runs out of luck it was out in arkansas i made the wrong turn at a cross road and drives into this town of peavine by mistake it seems i had already assaulted and disfigured peavine the spring of the year before i had sold worth of young fruit trees there plums cherries peaches and pears the peaviners were keeping an eye on the country road and hoping i might pass that way again i drove down main street as far as the crystal palace drugstore before i realized i had committed ambush upon myself and my white horse bill the peaviners took me by surprise and bill by the bridle and began a conversation that wasn t entirely disassociated with the subject of fruit trees a committee of em ran some trace chains through the armholes of my vest and escorted me through their gardens and orchards their fruit trees hadn t lived up to their labels most of em had turned out to be persimmons and dogwoods with a grove or two of blackjacks and poplars the only one that showed any signs of bearing anything was a fine young cottonwood that had put forth a hornet s nest and half of an old corset cover the peaviners protracted our fruitless stroll to the edge of town they took my watch and money on account and they kept bill and the wagon as hostages they said the first time one of them dogwood trees put forth an amsden s june peach i might come back and get my things then they took off the trace chains and jerked their thumbs in the direction of the rocky mountains and i struck a lewis and clark lope for the swollen rivers and impenetrable forests when i regained intellectualness i found myself walking into an unidentified town on the a t s f railroad the peaviners hadn t left anything in my pockets except a plug of chewing they wasn t after my life and that saved it i bit off a chunk and sits down on a pile of ties by the track to recogitate my sensations of thought and perspicacity and then along comes a fast freight which slows up a little at the town and off of it drops a black bundle that rolls for twenty yards in a cloud of dust and then gets up and begins to spit soft coal and interjections i see it is a young man broad across the face dressed more for pullmans than freights and with a cheerful kind of smile in spite of it all that made phoebe snow s job look like a chimney sweep s fall off says

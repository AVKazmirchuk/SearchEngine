with the gen ral passenger agent of the katy and they can keep up with the percession from where you laid the chunk but when a marquis monkeys with the innocent affections of a cook lady may i inquire what the case seems to call for the leathers shouted dry creek smithers you hearn er charity was the kid s form of corroboration we ve got your company assented the cow punchers in chorus before the marquis realized their intention two of them seized him by each arm and led him up to the log phonograph davis self appointed to carry out the sentence stood ready with a pair of stout leather leggings in his hands it was the first time they had ever laid hands on the marquis during their somewhat rude sports what are you up to he asked indignantly with flashing eyes go easy marquis whispered rube fellows one of the boys that held him it s all in fun take it good natured and they ll let you off light they re only goin to stretch you over the log and tan you eight or ten times with the leggin s twon t hurt much the marquis with an exclamation of anger his white teeth gleaming suddenly exhibited a surprising strength he wrenched with his arms so violently that the four men were swayed and dragged many yards from the log a cry of anger escaped him and then miss sally his eyes cleared of the tobacco saw and he immediately mixed with the struggling group but at that moment a loud hallo rang in their ears and a buckboard drawn by a team of galloping mustangs spun into the campfire s circle of light every man turned to look and what they saw drove from their minds all thoughts of carrying out phonograph davis s rather time worn contribution to the evening s amusement bigger game than the marquis was at hand and his captors released him and stood staring at the approaching victim the buckboard and team belonged to sam holly a cattleman from the big muddy sam was driving and with him was a stout smooth faced man wearing a frock coat and a high silk hat that was the county judge mr dave hackett candidate for reelection sam was escorting him about the county among the camps to shake up the sovereign voters the men got out hitched the team to a mesquite and walked toward the fire instantly every man in camp except the marquis miss sally and pink saunders who had to play host uttered a frightful yell of assumed terror and fled on all sides into the darkness heavens alive exclaimed hackett are we as ugly as that how do you do mr saunders glad to see you again what are you doing to my hat holly i was afraid of this hat said sam holly meditatively he had taken the hat from hackett s head and was holding it in his hand looking dubiously around at the shadows beyond the firelight where now absolute stillness reigned what do you think saunders pink grinned better elevate it some he said in the tone of one giving disinterested advice the light ain t none too good i wouldn t want it on my head holly stepped upon the hub of a hind wheel of the grub wagon and hung the hat upon a limb of a live oak scarcely had his foot touched the ground when the crash of a dozen six shooters split the air and the hat fell to the ground riddled with bullets a hissing noise was heard as if from a score of rattlesnakes and now the cow punchers emerged on all sides from the darkness stepping high with ludicrously exaggerated caution and hist ing to one another to observe the utmost prudence in approaching they formed a solemn wide circle about the hat gazing at it in manifest alarm and seized every few moments by little stampedes of panicky flight it s the varmint said one in awed tones that flits up and down in the low grounds at night saying willie wallo it s the venomous kypootum proclaimed another it stings after it s dead and hollers after it s buried it s the chief of the hairy tribe said phonograph davis but it s stone dead now boys don t you believe it demurred dry creek it s only possumin it s the dreaded highgollacum fantod from the forest there s only one way to destroy its life he led forward old taller the pound cow puncher old taller placed the hat upright on the ground and solemnly sat upon it crushing it as flat as a pancake hackett had viewed these proceedings with wide open eyes sam holly saw that his anger was rising and said to him here s where you win or lose judge there are sixty votes on the diamond cross the boys are trying your mettle take it as a joke and i don t think you ll regret it and hackett saw the point and rose to the occasion advancing to where the slayers of the wild beast were standing above its remains and declaring it to be at last defunct he said with deep earnestness boys i must thank you for this gallant rescue while driving through the arroyo that cruel monster that you have so fearlessly and repeatedly slaughtered sprang upon us from the tree tops to you i shall consider that i owe my life and also i hope reelection to the office for which i am again a candidate allow me to hand you my card the cow punchers always so sober faced while engaged in their monkey shines relaxed into a grin of approval but phonograph davis his appetite for fun not yet appeased had something more up his sleeve pardner he said addressing hackett with grave severity many a camp would be down on you for turnin loose a pernicious varmint like that in it but bein as we all escaped without loss of life we ll overlook it you can play square with us if you ll do it how s that asked hackett suspiciously you re authorized to perform the sacred rights and lefts of mattermony air you not well yes replied hackett a marriage ceremony conducted by me would be legal a wrong air to be righted in this here camp said phonograpby virtuously a a ristocrat have slighted a umble but beautchoos female wat s pinin for his affections it s the jooty of the camp to drag forth the haughty descendant of a hundred or maybe a hundred and twenty five earls even so at the p int of a lariat and jine him to the weepin lady fellows roundup miss sally and the marquis there s goin to be a weddin this whim of phonograph s was received with whoops of appreciation the cow punchers started to apprehend the principals of the proposed ceremony kindly prompt me said hackett wiping his forehead though the night was cool how far this thing is to be carried and might i expect any further portions of my raiment to be mistaken for wild animals and killed the boys are livelier than usual to night said saunders the ones they are talking about marrying are two of the boys a herd rider and the cook it s another joke you and sam will have to sleep here to night anyway p rhaps you d better see em through with it maybe they ll quiet down after that the matchmakers found miss sally seated on the tongue of the grub wagon calmly smoking his pipe the marquis was leaning idly against one of the trees under which the supply tent was pitched into this tent they were both hustled and phonograph as master of ceremonies gave orders for the preparations you dry creek and jimmy and ben and taller hump yourselves to the wildwood and rustle flowers for the blow out mesquite ll do and get that spanish dagger blossom at the corner of the horse corral for the bride to pack you limpy get out that red and yaller blanket of your n for miss sally s skyirt marquis you ll do thout fixin nobody don t ever look at the groom during their absurd preparation the two principals were left alone for a few moments in the tent the marquis suddenly showed wild perturbation this foolishness must not go on he said turning to miss sally a face white in the light of the lantern hanging to the ridge pole why not said the cook with an amused smile it s fun for the boys and they ve always let you off pretty light in their frolics i don t mind it but you don t understand persisted the marquis pleadingly that man is county judge and his acts are binding i can t oh you don t know the cook stepped forward and took the marquis s hands sally bascom he said i know you know faltered the marquis trembling and you want to more than i ever wanted anything will you here come the boys the cow punchers crowded in laden with armfuls of decorations perfifious coyote said phonograph sternly addressing the marquis air you willing to patch up the damage you ve did this ere slab sided but trustin bunch o calico by single footin easy to the altar or will we have to rope ye and drag you thar the marquis pushed back his hat and leaned jauntily against some high piled sacks of beans his cheeks were flushed and his eyes were shining go on with the rat killin said be a little while after a procession approached the tree under which hackett holly and saunders were sitting smoking limpy walker was in the lead extracting a doleful tune from his concertina next came the bride and groom the cook wore the gorgeous navajo blanket tied around his waist and carried in one band the waxen white spanish dagger blossom as large as a peck measure and weighing fifteen pounds his hat was ornamented with mesquite branches and yellow ratama blooms a resurrected mosquito bar served as a veil after them stumbled phonograph davis in the character of the bride s father weeping into a saddle blanket with sobs that could be heard a mile away the cow punchers followed by twos loudly commenting upon the bride s appearance in a supposed imitation of the audiences at fashionable weddings hackett rose as the procession halted before him and after a little lecture upon matrimony asked what are your names sally and charles answered the cook join hands charles and sally perhaps there never was a stranger wedding for wedding it was though only two of those present knew it when the ceremony was over the cow punchers gave one yell of congratulation and immediately abandoned their foolery for the night blankets were unrolled and sleep became the paramount question the cook divested of his decorations and the marquis lingered for a moment in the shadow of the grub wagon the marquis leaned her head against his shoulder i didn t know what else to do she was saying father was gone and we kids had to rustle i had helped him so much with the cattle that i thought i d turn cowboy there wasn t anything else i could make a living at i wasn t much stuck on it though after i got here and i d have left only only what you know tell me something when did you first what made you oh it was as soon as we struck the camp when saunders bawled out the marquis and miss sally i saw how rattled you got at the name and i had my sus cheeky whispered the marquis and why should you think that i thought he was calling me miss sally because answered the cook calmly i was the marquis my father was the marquis of borodale but you ll excuse that won t you sally it really isn t my fault you know a fog in santone published in the cosmopolitan october probably written in or shortly after o henry s first successes in new york the drug clerk looks sharply at the white face half concealed by the high turned overcoat collar i would rather not supply you he said doubtfully i sold you a dozen morphine tablets less than an hour ago the customer smiles wanly the fault is in your crooked streets i didn t intend to call upon you twice but i guess i got tangled up excuse me he draws his collar higher and moves out slowly he stops under an electric light at the corner and juggles absorbedly with three or four little pasteboard boxes thirty six he announces to himself more than plenty for a gray mist had swept upon santone that night an opaque terror that laid a hand to the throat of each of the city s guests it was computed that three thousand invalids were hibernating in the town they had come from far and wide for here among these contracted river sliced streets the goddess ozone has elected to linger purest atmosphere sir on earth you might think from the river winding through our town that we are malarial but no sir repeated experiments made both by the government and local experts show that our air contains nothing deleterious nothing but ozone sir pure ozone litmus paper tests made all along the river show but you can read it all in the prospectuses or the santonian will recite it for you word by word we may achieve climate but weather is thrust upon us santone then cannot be blamed for this cold gray fog that came and kissed the lips of the three thousand and then delivered them to the cross that night the tubercles whose ravages hope holds in check multiplied the writhing fingers of the pale mist did not go thence bloodless many of the wooers of ozone capitulated with the enemy that night turning their faces to the wall in that dumb isolated apathy that so terrifies their watchers on the red stream of hemorrhagia a few souls drifted away leaving behind pathetic heaps white and chill as the fog itself two or three came to view this atmospheric wraith as the ghost of impossible joys sent to whisper to them of the egregious folly it is to inhale breath into the lungs only to exhale it again and these used whatever came handy to their relief pistols gas or the beneficent muriate the purchaser of the morphia wanders into the fog and at length finds himself upon a little iron bridge one of the score or more in the heart of the city under which the small tortuous river flows he leans on the rail and gasps for here the mist has concentrated lying like a foot pad to garrote such of the three thousand as creep that way the iron bridge guys rattle to the strain of his cough a

resort for your whiskers a lake erie fog d get lost here in two minutes you said something about a drink says goodall a few minutes later they line up at a glittering bar and hang upon the arm rest the bartender blond heavy well groomed sets out their drinks instantly perceiving that he serves two of the three thousand he observes that one is a middle aged man well dressed with a lined and sunken face the other a mere boy who is chiefly eyes and overcoat disguising well the tedium begotten by many repetitions the server of drinks begins to chant the sanitary saga of santone rather a moist night gentlemen for our town a little fog from our river but nothing to hurt repeated tests damn your litmus papers gasps toledo without any personal offense intended we ve beard of em before let em turn red white and blue what we want is a repeated test of that whiskey come again i paid for the last round goodall of memphis the bottle oscillates from one to the other continues to do so and is not removed from the counter the bartender sees two emaciated invalids dispose of enough kentucky belle to floor a dozen cowboys without displaying any emotion save a sad and contemplative interest in the peregrinations of the bottle so he is moved to manifest a solicitude as to the consequences not on your uncle mark hanna responds toledo will we get drunk we ve been vaccinated with whiskey and cod liver oil what would send you to the police station only gives us a thirst s s set out another bottle it is slow work trying to meet death by that route some quicker way must be found they leave the saloon and plunge again into the mist the sidewalks are mere flanges at the base of the houses the street a cold ravine the fog filling it like a freshet not far away is the mexican quarter conducted as if by wires along the heavy air comes a guitar s tinkle and the demoralizing voice of some senorita singing en las tardes sombrillos del invierro en el prado a marar me reclino y maldigo mi fausto destino una vida la mas infeliz the words of it they do not understand neither toledo nor memphis but words are the least important things in life the music tears the breasts of the seekers after nepenthe inciting toledo to remark those kids of mine i wonder by god mr goodall of memphis we had too little of that whiskey no slow music in mine if you please it makes you disremember

you ain t going along good by goodall of memphis he rounds the corner and shuffles away casting off thus easily the ties of acquaintanceship as the moribund do the season of dissolution being man s supreme hour of egoism and selfishness but he turns and calls back through the fog to the other i say goodall of memphis if you get there before i do tell em hurd s a comin too hurd of t leder ah hia thus goodall s tempter deserts him that youth un complaining and uncaring takes a spell at coughing and recovered wanders desultorily on down the street the name of which he neither knows nor recks at a certain point he perceives swinging doors and hears filtering between them a noise of wind and string instruments two men enter from the street as he arrives and he follows them in there is a kind of ante chamber plentifully set with palms and cactuses and oleanders at little marble topped tables some people sit while soft shod attendants bring the beer all is orderly clean melancholy gay of the german method of pleasure at his right is the foot of a stairway a man there holds out his hand goodall extends his full of silver the man selects therefrom a coin goodall goes upstairs and sees there two galleries extending along the sides of a concert hall which he now perceives to lie below and beyond the anteroom he first entered these galleries are divided into boxes or stalls which bestow with the aid of hanging lace curtains a certain privacy upon their occupants passing with aimless feet down the aisle contiguous to these saucy and discreet compartments he is half checked by the sight in one of them of a young woman alone and seated in an attitude of reflection this young woman becomes aware of his approach a smile from her brings him to a standstill and her subsequent invitation draws him though hesitating to the other chair in the box a little table between them goodall is only nineteen there are some whom when the terrible god phthisis wishes to destroy be first makes beautiful and the boy is one of these his face is wax and an awful pulchritude is born of the menacing flame in his cheeks his eyes reflect an unearthly vista engendered by the certainty of his doom as it is forbidden man to guess accurately concerning his fate it is inevitable that he shall tremble at the slightest lifting of the veil the young woman is well dressed and exhibits a beauty of distinctly feminine and tender sort an eve like comeliness that scarcely seems predestined to fade it is immaterial the steps by which the two mount to a certain plane of good understanding they are short and few as befits the occasion a button against the wall of the partition is frequently disturbed and a waiter comes and goes at signal pensive beauty would nothing of wine two thick plaits of her blond hair hang almost to the floor she is a lineal descendant of the lorelei so the waiter brings the brew effervescent icy greenish golden the orchestra on the stage is playing oh rachel the youngsters have exchanged a good bit of information she calls him walter and he calls her miss rosa goodall s tongue is loosened and he has told her everything about himself about his home in tennessee the old pillared mansion under the oaks the stables the hunting the friends he has down to the chickens and the box bushes bordering the walks about his coming south for the climate hoping to escape the hereditary foe of his family all about his three months on a ranch the deer hunts the rattlers and the rollicking in the cow camps then of his advent to santone where he had indirectly learned from a great specialist that his life s calendar probably contains but two more leaves and then of this death white choking night which has come and strangled his fortitude and sent him out to seek a port amid its depressing billows my weekly letter from home failed to come he told her and i was pretty blue i knew i had to go before long and i was tired of waiting i went out and bought morphine at every drug store where they would sell me a few tablets i got thirty six quarter grains and was going back to my room and take them but i met a queer fellow on a bridge who had a new idea goodall fillips a little pasteboard box upon the table i put em all together in there miss rosa being a woman must raise the lid and gave a slight shiver at the innocent looking triturates horrid things but those little white bits they could never kill one indeed they could walter knew better nine grains of morphia why half the amount might miss rosa demands to know about mr hurd of toledo and is told she laughs like a delighted child what a funny fellow but tell me more about your home and your sisters walter i know enough about texas and tarantulas and cowboys the theme is dear just now to his mood and he lays before her the simple details of a true home the little ties and endearments that so fill the exile s heart of his sisters one alice furnishes him a theme he loves to dwell upon she is like you miss rosa he says maybe not quite so pretty but just as nice and good and there walter says miss rosa sharply now talk about something else but a shadow falls upon the wall outside preceding a big softly treading man finely dressed who pauses a second before the curtains and then passes on presently comes the waiter with a message mr rolfe says tell rolfe i m engaged i don t know why it is says goodall of memphis but i don t feel as bad as i did an hour ago i wanted to die but since i ve met you miss rosa i d like so much to live the young woman whirls around the table lays an arm behind his neck and kisses him on the cheek you must dear boy she says i know what was the matter it was the miserable foggy weather that has lowered your spirit and mine too a little but look now with a little spring she has drawn back the curtains a window is in the wall opposite and lo the mist is cleared away the indulgent moon is out again revoyaging the plumbless sky roof and parapet and spire are softly pearl enamelled twice thrice the retrieved river flashes back between the houses the light of the firmament a tonic day will dawn sweet and prosperous talk of death when the world is so beautiful says miss rosa laying her hand on his shoulder do something to please me walter go home to your rest and say i mean to get better and do it if you ask it says the boy with a smile i will the waiter brings full glasses did they ring no but it is well he may leave them a farewell glass miss rosa says to your better health walter he says to our next meeting his eyes look no longer into the void but gaze upon the antithesis of death his foot is set in an undiscovered country to night he is obedient ready to go good night she says i never kissed a girl before he confesses except my sisters you didn t this time she laughs i kissed you good night when shall i see you again he persists you promised me to go home she frowns and get well perhaps we shall meet again soon good night he hesitates his hat in hand she smiles broadly and kisses him once more upon the forehead she watches him far down the aisle then sits again at the table the shadow falls once more against the wall this time the big softly stepping man parts the curtains and looks in miss rosa s eyes meet his and for half a minute they remain thus silent fighting a battle with that king of weapons presently the big man drops the curtains and passes on the orchestra ceases playing suddenly and an important voice can be heard loudly talking in one of the boxes farther down the aisle no doubt some citizen entertains there some visitor to the town and miss rosa leans back in her chair and smiles at some of the words she catches purest atmosphere in the world litmus paper all long nothing hurtful our city nothing but pure ozone the waiter returns for the tray and glasses as he enters the girl crushes a little empty pasteboard box in her hand and throws it in a corner she is stirring something in her glass with her hatpin why miss rosa says the waiter with the civil familiarity he uses putting salt in your beer this early in the night the friendly call published in monthly magazine section july when i used to sell hardware in the west i often made a little town called saltillo in colorado i was always certain of securing a small or a large order from simon bell who kept a general store there bell was one of those six foot low voiced products formed from a union of the west and the south i liked him to look at him you would think he should be robbing stage coaches or juggling gold mines with both hands but he would sell you a paper of tacks or a spool of thread with ten times more patience and courtesy than any saleslady in a city department store i had a twofold object in my last visit to saltillo one was to sell a bill of goods the other to advise bell of a chance that i knew of by which i was certain he could make a small fortune in mountain city a town on the union pacific five times larger than saltillo a mercantile firm was about to go to the wall it had a lively and growing custom but was on the edge of dissolution and ruin mismanagement and the gambling habits of one of the partners explained it the condition of the firm was not yet public property i had my knowledge of it from a private source i knew that if the ready cash were offered the stock and good will could be bought for about one fourth their value on arriving in saltillo i went to bell s store he nodded to me smiled his broad lingering smile went on leisurely selling some candy to a little girl then came around the counter and shook hands well he said his invariably preliminary jocosity fit every call i made i suppose you are out here making kodak pictures of the mountains it s the wrong time of the year to buy any hardware of course i told bell about the bargain in mountain city if he wanted to take advantage of it i would rather have missed a sale than have him overstocked in saltillo it sounds good he said with enthusiasm i d like to branch out and do a bigger business and i m obliged to you for mentioning it but well you come and stay at my house to night and i ll think about it it was then after sundown and time for the larger stores in saltillo to close the clerks in bell s put away their books whirled the combination of the safe put on their coats and hats and left for their homes bell padlocked the big double wooden front doors and we stood for a moment breathing the keen fresh mountain air coming across the foothills a big man walked down the street and stopped in front of the high porch of the store his long black moustache black eyebrows and curly black hair contrasted queerly with his light pink complexion which belonged by rights to a blonde he was about forty and wore a white vest a white hat a watch chain made of five dollar gold pieces linked together and a rather well fitting two piece gray suit of the cut that college boys of eighteen are wont to affect he glanced at me distrustfully and then at bell with coldness and i thought something of enmity in his expression well asked bell as if he were addressing a stranger did you fix up that matter did i the man answered in a resentful tone what do you suppose i ve been here two weeks for the business is to be settled to night does that suit you or have you got something to kick about it s all right said bell i knew you d do it of course you did said the magnificent stranger haven t i done it before you have admitted bell and so have i how do you find it at the hotel rocky grub but i ain t kicking say can you give me any pointers about managing that affair it s my first deal in that line of business you know no i can t answered bell after some thought i ve tried all kinds of ways you ll have to try some of your own tried soft soap barrels of it tried a saddle girth with a buckle on the end of it never none started to once and here s what i got bill held out his right hand even in the deepening twilight i could see on the back of it a long white scar that might have been made by a claw or a knife or some sharp edged tool oh well said the florid man carelessly i ll know what to do later on he walked away without another word when he had gone ten steps he turned and called to bell you keep well out of the way when the goods are delivered so there won t be any hitch in the business all right answered bell i ll attend to my end of the line this talk was scarcely clear in its meaning to me but as it did not concern me i did not let it weigh upon my mind but the singularity of the other man s appearance lingered with me for a while and as we walked toward bell s house i remarked to him your customer seems to be a surly kind of fellow not one that you d like to be snowed in with in a camp on a hunting trip he is that assented bell heartily he reminds me of a rattlesnake that s been poisoned by the bite of a tarantula he doesn t look like a citizen of saltillo i went on no said bell he lives in sacramento he s down here on a little business trip his name is george ringo and he s been my best friend in fact the only friend i ever had for twenty years i was too surprised to make any further comment bell lived in a comfortable plain square two story white house on the edge of the little town i waited in the parlor a room depressingly genteel furnished with red plush straw matting looped up lace curtains and a glass case large enough to contain a mummy full of mineral specimens while i waited i heard upstairs that unmistakable sound instantly recognized the world over a bickering woman s voice rising as her anger and fury grew i could hear between the gusts the temperate rumble of bell s tones striving to oil the troubled waters the storm subsided soon but not before i had heard the woman say in a lower concentrated tone rather more carrying than her high pitched railings this is the last time i tell you the last time oh you will understand the household seemed to consist of only bell and his wife and a servant or two i was introduced to mrs bell at supper at first sight she seemed to be a handsome woman but i soon perceived that her charm had been spoiled an uncontrolled petulance i thought and emotional egotism an absence of poise and a habitual dissatisfaction had marred her womanhood during the meal she showed that false gayety spurious kindliness and reactionary softness that mark the woman addicted to tantrums withal she was a woman who might be attractive to many men after supper bell and i took our chairs outside set them on the grass in the moonlight and smoked the full moon is a witch in her light truthful men dig up for you nuggets of purer gold while liars squeeze out brighter colors from the tubes of their invention i saw bell s broad slow smile come out upon his face and linger there i reckon you think george and me are a funny kind of friends he said the fact is we never did take much interest in each other s company but his idea and mine of what a friend should be was always synonymous and we lived up to it strict all these years now i ll give you an idea of what our idea is a man don t need but one friend the fellow who drinks your liquor and hangs around you slapping you on the back and taking up your time telling you how much he likes you ain t a friend even if you did play marbles at school and fish in the same creek with him as long as you don t need a friend one of that kind may answer but a friend to my mind is one you can deal with on a strict reciprocity basis like me and george have always done a good many years ago him and me was connected in a number of ways we put our capital together and run a line of freight wagons in new mexico and we mined some and gambled a few and then we got into trouble of one or two kinds and i reckon that got us on a better understandable basis than anything else did unless it was the fact that we never had much personal use for each other s ways george is the vainest man i ever see and the biggest brag he could blow the biggest geyser in the yosemite valley back into its hole with one whisper i am a quiet man and fond of studiousness and thought the more we used to see each other personally the less we seemed to like to be together if he ever had slapped me on the back and snivelled over me like i ve seen men do to what they called their friends i know i d have had a rough and tumble with him on the spot same way with george he hated my ways as bad as i did his when we were mining we lived in separate tents so as not to intrude our obnoxiousness on each other but after a long time we begun to know each of us could depend on the other when we were in a pinch up to his last dollar word of honor or perjury bullet or drop of blood we had in the world we never even spoke of it to each other because that would have spoiled it but we tried it out time after time until we came to know i ve grabbed my hat and jumped a freight and rode miles to identify him when he was about to be hung by mistake in idaho for a train robber once i laid sick of typhoid in a tent in texas without a dollar or a change of clothes and sent for george in boise city he came on the next train the first thing he did before speaking to me was to hang up a little looking glass on the side of the tent and curl his moustache and rub some hair dye on his head his hair is naturally a light reddish then he gave me the most scientific cussing i ever had and took off his coat if you wasn t a moses meek little mary s lamb you wouldn t have been took down this way says he haven t you got gumption enough not to drink swamp water or fall down and scream whenever you have a little colic or feel a mosquito bite you he made me a little mad you ve got the bedside manners of a piute medicine man says i and i wish you d go away and let me die a natural death i m sorry i sent for you i ve a mind to says george for nobody cares whether you live or die but now i ve been tricked into coming i might as well stay until this little attack of indigestion or nettle rash or whatever it is passes away two weeks afterward when i was beginning to get around again the doctor laughed and said he was sure that my friend s keeping me mad all the time did more than his drugs to cure me so that s the way george and me was friends there wasn t any sentiment about it it was just give and take and each of us knew that the other was ready for the call at any time i remember once i played a sort of joke on george just to try him i felt a little mean about it afterward because i never ought to have doubted he d do it we was both living in a little town in the san luis valley running some flocks of sheep and a few cattle we were partners but as usual we didn t live together i had an old aunt out from the east visiting for the summer so i rented a little cottage she soon had a couple of cows and some pigs and chickens to make the place look like home george lived alone in a little cabin half a mile out of town one day a calf that we had died that night i broke its bones dumped it into a coarse sack and tied it up with wire i put on an old shirt tore a sleeve most out of it and the collar half off tangled up my hair put some red ink on my hands and spashed some of it over my shirt and face i must have looked like i d been having the fight of my life i put the sack in a wagon and drove out to george s cabin when i halloed he came out in a yellow dressing gown a turkish cap and patent leather shoes george always was a great dresser i dumped the bundle to the ground sh sh says i kind of wild in my way take that and bury it george out somewhere behind your house bury it just like it is and don don t get excited says george and for the lord s sake go and wash your hands and face and put on a clean shirt and he lights his pipe while i drive away at a gallop the next morning he drops around to our cottage where my aunt was fiddling with her flowers and truck in the front yard he bends himself and bows and makes compliments as be could do when so disposed and begs a rose bush from her saying he had turned up a little land back of his cabin and wanted to plant something on it by way of usefulness and ornament so my aunt flattered pulls up one of her biggest by the roots and gives it to him afterward i see it growing where he planted it in a place where the grass had been cleared off and the dirt levelled but neither george nor me ever spoke of it to each other again the moon rose higher possibly drawing water from the sea pixies from their dells and certainly more confidences from simms bell the friend of a friend there come a time not long afterward he went on when i was able to do a good turn for george ringo george had made a little pile of money in beeves and he was up in denver and he showed up when i saw him wearing deer skin vests yellow shoes clothes like the awnings in front of drug stores and his hair dyed so blue that it looked black in the dark he wrote me to come up there quick that he needed me and to bring the best outfit of clothes i had i had em on when i got the letter so i left on the next train george was bell stopped for half a minute listening intently i thought i heard a team coming down the road he explained george was at a summer resort on a lake near denver and was putting on as many airs as he knew how he had rented a little two room cottage and had a chihauhau dog and a hammock and eight different kinds of walking sticks simms he says to me there s a widow woman here that s pestering the soul out of me with her intentions i can t get out of her way it ain t that she ain t handsome and agreeable in a sort of style but her attentions is serious and i ain t ready for to marry nobody and settle down i can t go to no festivity nor sit on the hotel piazza or mix in any of the society round ups but what she cuts me out of the herd and puts her daily brand on me i like this here place goes on george and i m making a hit here in the most censorious circles so i don t want to have to run away from it so i sent for you what do you want me to do i asks george why says he i want you to head her off i want you to cut me out i want you to come to the rescue suppose you seen a wildcat about for to eat me what would you do go for it says i correct says george then go for this mrs de clinton the same how am i to do it i asks by force and awfulness or in some gentler and less lurid manner court her george says get her off my trail feed her take her out in boats hang around her and stick to her get her mashed on you if you can some women are pretty big fools who knows but what she might take a fancy to you had you ever thought i asks of repressing your fatal fascinations in her presence of squeezing a harsh note in the melody of your siren voice of veiling your beauty in other words of giving her the bounce yourself george sees no essence of sarcasm in my remark he twists his moustache and looks at the points of his shoes well simms he said you know how i am about the ladies i can t hurt none of their feelings i m by nature polite and esteemful of their intents and purposes this mrs de clinton don t appear to be the suitable sort for me besides i ain t a marrying man by all means all right said i i ll do the best i can in the case so i bought a new outfit of clothes and a book on etiquette and made a dead set for mrs de clinton she was a fine looking woman cheerful and gay at first i almost had to hobble her to keep her from loping around at george s heels but finally i got her so she seemed glad to go riding with me and sailing on the lake and she seemed real hurt on the mornings when i forgot to send her a bunch of flowers still i didn t like the way she looked at george sometimes out of the corner of her eye george was having a fine time now going with the whole bunch just as he pleased yes m continued bell she certainly was a fine looking woman at that time she s changed some since as you might have noticed at the supper table what i exclaimed i married mrs de clinton went on bell one evening while we were up at the lake when i told george about it he opened his mouth and i thought be was going to break our traditions and say something grateful but he swallowed it back all right says he playing with his dog i hope you won t have too much trouble myself i m not never going to marry that was three years ago said bell we came here to live for a year we got along medium fine and then everything changed for two years i ve been having something that rhymes first class with my name you heard the row upstairs this evening that was a merry welcome compared to the usual average she s tired of me and of this little town life and she rages all day like a panther in a cage i stood it until two weeks ago and then i had to send out the call i located george in sacramento he started the day he got my wire mrs bell came out of the house swiftly toward us some strong excitement or anxiety seemed to possess her but she smiled a faint hostess smile and tried to keep her voice calm the dew is falling she said and it s growing rather late wouldn t you gentlemen rather come into the house bell took some cigars from his pocket and answered it s most too fine a night to turn in yet i think mr ames and i will walk out along the road a mile or so and have another smoke i want to talk with him about some goods that i want to buy up the road or down the road asked mrs bell down said bell i thought she breathed a sigh of relief when we had gone a hundred yards and the house became concealed by trees bell guided me into the thick grove that lined the road and back through them toward the house again we stopped within twenty yards of the house concealed by the dark shadows i wondered at this maneuver and then i heard in the distance coming down the road beyond the house the regular hoofbeats of a team of horses bell held his watch in a ray of moonlight on time within a minute he said that s george s way the team slowed up as it drew near the house and stopped in a patch of black shadows we saw the figure of a woman carrying a heavy valise move swiftly from the other side of the house and hurry to the waiting vehicle then it rolled away briskly in the direction from which it had come i looked at bell inquiringly i suppose i certainly asked him no question she s running away with george said bell simply he s kept me posted about the progress of the scheme all along she ll get a divorce in six months and then george will marry her he never helps anybody halfway it s all arranged between them i began to wonder what friendship was after all when we went into the house bell began to talk easily on other subjects and i took his cue by and by the big chance to buy out the business in mountain city came back to my mind and i began to urge it upon him now that he was free it would be easier for him to make the move and he was sure of a splendid bargain bell was silent for some minutes but when i looked at him i fancied that he was thinking of something else that he was not considering the project why no mr ames he said after a while i can t make that deal i m awful thankful to you though for telling me about it but i ve got to stay here i can t go to mountain city why i asked missis bell he replied won t live in mountain city she hates the place and wouldn t go there i ve got to keep right on here in saltillo mrs bell i exclaimed too puzzled to conjecture what he meant i ought to explain said bell i know george and i know mrs bell he s impatient in his ways he can t stand things that fret him long like i can six months i give them six months of married life and there ll be another disunion mrs bell will come back to me there s no other place for her to go i ve got to stay here and wait at the end of six months i ll have to grab a satchel and catch the first train for george will be sending out the call a dinner at footnote see advertising column where to dine well in the daily newspapers the story referred to in this skit appears in the trimmed lamp under the same title the badge of policeman o roon the adventures of an author with his own hero all that day in fact from the moment of his creation van sweller had conducted himself fairly well in my eyes of course i had had to make many concessions but in return he had been no less considerate once or twice we had had sharp brief contentions over certain points of behavior but prevailingly give and take had been our rule his morning toilet provoked our first tilt van sweller went about it confidently the usual thing i suppose old chap he said with a smile and a yawn i ring for a b and s and then i have my tub i splash a good deal in the water of course you are aware that there are two ways in which i can receive tommy carmichael when he looks in to have a chat about polo i can talk to him through the bathroom door or i can be picking at a grilled bone which my man has brought in which would you prefer i smiled with diabolic satisfaction at his coming discomfiture neither i said you will make your appearance on the scene when a gentleman should after you are fully dressed which indubitably private function shall take place behind closed doors and i will feel indebted to you if after you do appear your deportment and manners are such that it will not be necessary to inform the public in order to appease its apprehension that you have taken a bath van sweller slightly elevated his brows oh very well he said a trifle piqued i rather imagine it concerns you more than it does me cut the tub by all means if you think best but it has been the usual thing you know this was my victory but after van sweller emerged from his apartments in the beaujolie i was vanquished in a dozen small but well contested skirmishes i allowed him a cigar but routed him on the question of naming its brand but he worsted me when i objected to giving him a coat unmistakably english in its cut i allowed him to stroll down broadway and even permitted passers by god knows there s nowhere to pass but by to turn their heads and gaze with evident admiration at his erect figure i demeaned myself and as a barber gave him a smooth dark face with its keen frank eye and firm jaw later on he looked in at the club and saw freddy vavasour polo team captain dawdling over grilled bone no dear old boy began van sweller but in an instant i had seized him by the collar and dragged him aside with the scantiest courtesy for heaven s sake talk like a man i said sternly do you think it is manly to use those mushy and inane forms of address that man is neither dear nor old nor a boy to my surprise van sweller turned upon me a look of frank pleasure i am glad to hear you say that he said heartily i used those words because i have been forced to say them so often they really are contemptible thanks for correcting me dear old boy still i must admit that van sweller s conduct in the park that morning was almost without flaw the courage the dash the modesty the skill and fidelity that he displayed atoned for everything this is the way the story runs van sweller has been a gentleman member of the rugged riders the company that made a war with a foreign country famous among his comrades was lawrence o roon a man whom van sweller liked a strange thing and a hazardous one in fiction was that van sweller and o roon resembled each other mightily in face form and general appearance after the war van sweller pulled wires and o roon was made a mounted policeman now one night in new york there are commemorations and libations by old comrades and in the morning mounted policeman o roon unused to potent liquids another premise hazardous in fiction finds the earth bucking and bounding like a bronco with no stirrup into which he may insert foot and save his honor and his badge noblesse oblige surely so out along the driveways and bridle paths trots hudson van sweller in the uniform of his incapacitated comrade as like unto him as one french pea is unto a petit pois it is of course jolly larks for van sweller who has wealth and social position enough for him to masquerade safely even as a police commissioner doing his duty if he wished to do so but society not given to scanning the countenances of mounted policemen sees nothing unusual in the officer on the beat and then comes the runaway that is a fine scene the swaying victoria the impetuous daft horses plunging through the line of scattering vehicles the driver stupidly holding his broken reins and the ivory white face of amy ffolliott as she clings desperately with each slender hand fear has come and gone it has left her

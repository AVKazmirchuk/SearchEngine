and climbs that have brought back your health and strength god bless the old doctor just then the old doctor himself drove slowly down the road in his rickety old buggy i waved my hand at him and shouted that i would be on hand the next day at the usual time he stopped his horse and called to amaryllis to come out to him they talked for five minutes while i waited then the old doctor drove on when we got to the house amaryllis lugged out an encyclopaedia and sought a word in it the doctor said she told me that you needn t call any more as a patient but he d be glad to see you any time as a friend and then he told me to look up my name in the encyclopaedia and tell you what it means it seems to be the name of a genus of flowering plants and also the name of a country girl in theocritus and virgil what do you suppose the doctor meant by that i know what he meant said i i know now a word to a brother who may have come under the spell of the unquiet lady neurasthenia the formula was true even though gropingly at times the physicians of the walled cities had put their fingers upon the specific medicament and so for the exercise one is referred to good doctor tatum on black oak mountain take the road to your right at the methodist meeting house in the pine grove absolute rest and exercise what rest more remedial than to sit with amaryllis in the shade and with a sixth sense read the wordless theocritan idyl of the gold bannered blue mountains marching orderly into the dormitories of the night october and june the captain gazed gloomily at his sword that hung upon the wall in the closet near by was stored his faded uniform stained and worn by weather and service what a long long time it seemed since those old days of war s alarms and now veteran that he was of his country s strenuous times he had been reduced to abject surrender by a woman s soft eyes and smiling lips as he sat in his quiet room he held in his hand the letter he had just received from her the letter that had caused him to wear that look of gloom he re read the fatal paragraph that had destroyed his hope in declining the honour you have done me in asking me to be your wife i feel that i ought to speak frankly the reason i have for so doing is the great difference between our ages i like you very very much but i am sure that our marriage would not be a happy one i am sorry to have to refer to this but i believe that you will appreciate my honesty in giving you the true reason the captain sighed and leaned his head upon his hand yes there were many years between their ages but he was strong and rugged he had position and wealth would not his love his tender care and the advantages he could bestow upon her make her forget the question of age besides he was almost sure that she cared for him the captain was a man of prompt action in the field he had been distinguished for his decisiveness and energy he would see her and plead his cause again in person age what was it to come between him and the one he loved in two hours he stood ready in light marching order for his greatest battle he took the train for the old southern town in tennessee where she lived theodora deming was on the steps of the handsome porticoed old mansion enjoying the summer twilight when the captain entered the gate and came up the gravelled walk she met him with a smile that was free from embarrassment as the captain stood on the step below her the difference in their ages did not appear so great he was tall and straight and clear eyed and browned she was in the bloom of lovely womanhood i wasn t expecting you said theodora but now that you ve come you may sit on the step didn t you get my letter i did said the captain and that s why i came i say now theo reconsider your answer won t you theodora smiled softly upon him he carried his years well she was really fond of his strength his wholesome looks his manliness perhaps if no no she said shaking her head positively it s out of the question i like you a whole lot but marrying won t do my age and yours are but don t make me say it again i told you in my letter the captain flushed a little through the bronze on his face he was silent for a while gazing sadly into the twilight beyond a line of woods that he could see was a field where the boys in blue had once bivouacked on their march toward the sea how long ago it seemed now truly fate and father time had tricked him sorely just a few years interposed between himself and happiness theodora s hand crept down and rested in the clasp of his firm brown one she felt at least that sentiment that is akin to love don t take it so hard please she said gently it s all for the best i ve reasoned it out very wisely all by myself some day you ll be glad i didn t marry you it would be very nice and lovely for a while but just think in only a few short years what different tastes we would have one of us would want to sit by the fireside and read and maybe nurse neuralgia or rheumatism of evenings while

settled to night does that suit you or have you got something to kick about it s all right said bell i knew you d do it of course you did said the magnificent stranger haven t i done it before you have admitted bell and so have i how do you find it at the hotel rocky grub but i ain t kicking say can you give me any pointers about managing that affair it s my first deal in that line of business you know no i can t answered bell after some thought i ve tried all kinds of ways you ll have to try some of your own tried soft soap barrels of it tried a saddle girth with a buckle on the end of it never none started to once and here s what i got bill held out his right hand even in the deepening twilight i could see on the back of it a long white scar that might have been made by a claw or a knife or some sharp edged tool oh well said the florid man carelessly i ll know what to do later on he walked away without another word when he had gone ten steps he turned and called to bell you keep well out of the way when the goods are delivered so there won t be any hitch in the business all right answered bell i ll attend to my end of the line this talk was scarcely clear in its meaning to me but as it did not concern me i did not let it weigh upon my mind but the singularity of the other man s appearance lingered with me for a while and as we walked toward bell s house i remarked to him your customer seems to be a surly kind of fellow not one that you d like to be snowed in with in a camp on a hunting trip he is that assented bell heartily he reminds me of a rattlesnake that s been poisoned by the bite of a tarantula he doesn t look like a citizen of saltillo i went on no said bell he lives in sacramento he s down here on a little business trip his name is george ringo and he s been my best friend in fact the only friend i ever had for twenty years i was too surprised to make any further comment bell lived in a comfortable plain square two story white house on the edge of the little town i waited in the parlor a room depressingly genteel furnished with red plush straw matting looped up lace curtains and a glass case large enough to contain a mummy full of mineral specimens while i waited i heard upstairs that unmistakable sound instantly recognized the world over a bickering woman s voice rising as her anger and fury grew i could hear between the gusts the temperate rumble of bell s tones striving to oil the troubled waters the storm subsided soon but not before i had heard the woman say in a lower concentrated tone rather more carrying than her high pitched railings this is the last time i tell you the last time oh you will understand the household seemed to consist of only bell and his wife and a servant or two i was introduced to mrs bell at supper at first sight she seemed to be a handsome woman but i soon perceived that her charm had been spoiled an uncontrolled petulance i thought and emotional egotism an absence of poise and a habitual dissatisfaction had marred her womanhood during the meal she showed that false gayety spurious kindliness and reactionary softness that mark the woman addicted to tantrums withal she was a woman who might be attractive to many men after supper bell and i took our chairs outside set them on the grass in the moonlight and smoked the full moon is a witch in her light truthful men dig up for you nuggets of purer gold while liars squeeze out brighter colors from the tubes of their invention i saw bell s broad slow smile come out upon his face and linger there i reckon you think george and me are a funny kind of friends he said the fact is we never did take much interest in each other s company but his idea and mine of what a friend should be was always synonymous and we lived up to it strict all these years now i ll give you an idea of what our idea is a man don t need but one friend the fellow who drinks your liquor and hangs around you slapping you on the back and taking up your time telling you how much he likes you ain t a friend even if you did play marbles at school and fish in the same creek with him as long as you don t need a friend one of that kind may answer but a friend to my mind is one you can deal with on a strict reciprocity basis like me and george have always done a good many years ago him and me was connected in a number of ways we put our capital together and run a line of freight wagons in new mexico and we mined some and gambled a few and then we got into trouble of one or two kinds and i reckon that got us on a better understandable basis than anything else did unless it was the fact that we never had much personal use for each other s ways george is the vainest man i ever see and the biggest brag he could blow the biggest geyser in the yosemite valley back into its hole with one whisper i am a quiet man and fond of studiousness and thought the more we used to see each other personally the less

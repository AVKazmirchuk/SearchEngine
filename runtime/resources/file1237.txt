when meeks had settled his bill and departed shamrock jolnes stood with his hat in his hand before juggins if it would not be asking too much he stammered if you would favour me so far would you object to certainly not said juggins pleasantly i will tell you how i did it you remember the description of mrs snyder did you ever know a woman like that who wasn t paying weekly instalments on an enlarged crayon portrait of herself the biggest factory of that kind in the country is just around the corner i went there and got her address off the books that s all witches loaves miss martha meacham kept the little bakery on the corner the one where you go up three steps and the bell tinkles when you open the door miss martha was forty her bank book showed a credit of two thousand dollars and she possessed two false teeth and a sympathetic heart many people have married whose chances to do so were much inferior to miss martha s two or three times a week a customer came in in whom she began to take an interest he was a middle aged man wearing spectacles and a brown beard trimmed to a careful point he spoke english with a strong german accent his clothes were worn and darned in places and wrinkled and baggy in others but he looked neat and had very good manners he always bought two loaves of stale bread fresh bread was five cents a loaf stale ones were two for five never did he call for anything but stale bread once miss martha saw a red and brown stain on his fingers she was sure then that he was an artist and very poor no doubt he lived in a garret where he painted pictures and ate stale bread and thought of the good things to eat in miss martha s bakery often when miss martha sat down to her chops and light rolls and jam and tea she would sigh and wish that the gentle mannered artist might share her tasty meal instead of eating his dry crust in that draughty attic miss martha s heart as you have been told was a sympathetic one in order to test her theory as to his occupation she brought from her room one day a painting that she had bought at a sale and set it against the shelves behind the bread counter it was a venetian scene a splendid marble palazzio so it said on the picture stood in the foreground or rather forewater for the rest there were gondolas with the lady trailing her hand in the water clouds sky and chiaro oscuro in plenty no artist could fail to notice it two days afterward the customer came in two loafs of stale bread if you blease you haf here a fine bicture madame he said while she was wrapping up the bread yes says miss martha reveling in her own cunning i do so admire art and no it would not do to say artists thus early and paintings she substituted you think it is a good picture der balance said the customer is not in good drawing der bairspective of it is not true goot morning madame he took his bread bowed and hurried out yes he must be an artist miss martha took the picture back to her room how gentle and kindly his eyes shone behind his spectacles what a broad brow he had to be able to judge perspective at a glance and to live on stale bread but genius often has to struggle before it is recognized what a thing it would be for art and perspective if genius were backed by two thousand dollars in bank a bakery and a sympathetic heart to but these were day dreams miss martha often now when he came he would chat for a while across the showcase he seemed to crave miss martha s cheerful words he kept on buying stale bread never a cake never a pie never one of her delicious sally lunns she thought he began to look thinner and discouraged her heart ached to add something good to eat to his meagre purchase but her courage failed at the act she did not dare affront him she knew the pride of artists miss martha took to wearing her blue dotted silk waist behind the counter in the back room she cooked a mysterious compound of quince seeds and borax ever so many people use it for the complexion one day the customer came in as usual laid his nickel on the showcase and called for his stale loaves while miss martha was reaching for them there was a great tooting and clanging and a fire engine came lumbering past the customer hurried to the door to look as any one will suddenly inspired miss martha seized the opportunity on the bottom shelf behind the counter was a pound of fresh butter that the dairyman had left ten minutes before with a bread knife miss martha made a deep slash in each of the stale loaves inserted a generous quantity of butter and pressed the loaves tight again when the customer turned once more she was tying the paper around them when he had gone after an unusually pleasant little chat miss martha smiled to herself but not without a slight fluttering of the heart had she been too bold would he take offense but surely not there was no language of edibles butter was no emblem of unmaidenly forwardness for a long time that day her mind dwelt on the subject she imagined the scene when he should discover her little deception he would lay down his brushes and palette there would stand his easel with the picture he was painting in which the perspective was beyond criticism he would prepare for his luncheon of dry bread and water he would slice into a loaf ah miss martha blushed would he think of the hand that placed it there as he ate would he the front door bell jangled viciously somebody was coming in making a great deal of noise miss martha hurried to the front two men were there one was a young man smoking a pipe a man she had never seen before the other was her artist his face was very red his hat was on the back of his head his hair was wildly rumpled he clinched his two fists and shook them ferociously at miss martha at miss martha dummkopf he shouted with extreme loudness and then tausendonfer or something like it in german the young man tried to draw him away i vill not go he said angrily else i shall told her he made a bass drum of miss martha s counter you haf shpoilt me he cried his blue eyes blazing behind his spectacles i vill tell you you vas von meddingsome old cat miss martha leaned weakly against the shelves and laid one hand on her blue dotted silk waist the young man took the other by the collar come on he said you ve said enough he dragged the angry one out at the door to the sidewalk and then came back guess you ought to be told ma am he said what the row is about that s blumberger he s an architectural draftsman i work in the same office with him he s been working hard for three months drawing a plan for a new city hall it was a prize competition he finished inking the lines yesterday you know a draftsman always makes his drawing in pencil first when it s done he rubs out the pencil lines with handfuls of stale bread crumbs that s better than india rubber blumberger s been buying the bread here well to day well you know ma am that butter isn t well blumberger s plan isn t good for anything now except to cut up into railroad sandwiches miss martha went into the back room she took off the blue dotted silk waist and put on the old brown serge she used to wear then she poured the quince seed and borax mixture out of the window into the ash can the pride of the cities said mr kipling the cities are full of pride challenging each to each even so new york was empty two hundred thousand of its people were away for the summer three million eight hundred thousand remained as caretakers and to pay the bills of the absentees but the two hundred thousand are an expensive lot the new yorker sat at a roof garden table ingesting solace through a straw his panama lay upon a chair the july audience was scattered among vacant seats as widely as outfielders when the champion batter steps to the plate vaudeville happened at intervals the breeze was cool from the bay around and above everywhere except on the stage were stars glimpses were to be had of waiters always disappearing like startled chamois prudent visitors who had ordered refreshments by phone in the morning were now being served the new yorker was aware of certain drawbacks to his comfort but content beamed softly from his rimless eyeglasses his family was out of town the drinks were warm the ballet was suffering from lack of both tune and talcum but his family would not return until september then up into the garden stumbled the man from topaz city nevada the gloom of the solitary sightseer enwrapped him bereft of joy through loneliness he stalked with a widower s face through the halls of pleasure thirst for human companionship possessed him as he panted in the metropolitan draught straight to the new yorker s table he steered the new yorker disarmed and made reckless by the lawless atmosphere of a roof garden decided upon utter abandonment of his life s traditions he resolved to shatter with one rash dare devil impulsive hair brained act the conventions that had hitherto been woven into his existence carrying out this radical and precipitous inspiration he nodded slightly to the stranger as he drew nearer the table the next moment found the man from topaz city in the list of the new yorker s closest friends he took a chair at the table he gathered two others for his feet he tossed his broad brimmed hat upon a fourth and told his life s history to his new found pard the new yorker warmed a little as an apartment house furnace warms when the strawberry season begins a waiter who came within hail in an unguarded moment was captured and paroled on an errand to the doctor wiley experimental station the ballet was now in the midst of a musical vagary and danced upon the stage programmed as bolivian peasants clothed in some portions of its anatomy as norwegian fisher maidens in others as ladies in waiting of marie antoinette historically denuded in other portions so as to represent sea nymphs and presenting the tout ensemble of a social club of central park west housemaids at a fish fry been in the city long inquired the new yorker getting ready the exact tip against the waiter s coming with large change from the bill me said the man from topaz city four days never in topaz city was you i said the new yorker i was never farther west than eighth avenue i had a brother who died on ninth but i met the cortege at eighth there was a bunch of violets on the hearse and the undertaker mentioned the incident to avoid mistake i cannot say that i am familiar with the west topaz city said the man who occupied four chairs is one of the finest towns in the world i presume that you have seen the sights of the metropolis said the new yorker four days is not a sufficient length of time in which to view even our most salient points of interest but one can possibly form a general impression our architectural supremacy is what generally strikes visitors to our city most forcibly of course you have seen our flatiron building it is considered saw it said the man from topaz city but you ought to come out our way it s mountainous you know and the ladies all wear short skirts for climbing and excuse me said the new yorker but that isn t exactly the point new york must be a wonderful revelation to a visitor from the west now as to our hotels say said the man from topaz city that reminds me there were sixteen stage robbers shot last year within twenty miles of i was speaking of hotels said the new yorker we lead europe in that respect and as far as our leisure class is concerned we are far oh i don t know interrupted the man from topaz city there were twelve tramps in our jail when i left home i guess new york isn t so beg pardon you seem to misapprehend the idea of course you visited the stock exchange and wall street where the oh yes said the man from topaz city as he lighted a pennsylvania stogie and i want to tell you chat we ve got the finest town marshal west of the rockies bill rainer he took in five pickpockets out of the crowd when red nose thompson laid the cornerstone of his new saloon topaz city don t allow have another rhine wine and seltzer suggested the new yorker i ve never been west as i said but there can t be any place out there to compare with new york as to the claims of chicago i one man said the topazite one man only has been murdered and robbed in topaz city in the last three oh i know what chicago is interposed the new yorker have you been up fifth avenue to see the magnificent residences of our mil seen em all you ought to know reub stegall the assessor of topaz when old man tilbury that owns the only two story house in town tried to swear his taxes from down to reub buckled on his forty five and went down to see yes yes but speaking of our great city one of its greatest features is our superb police department there is no body of men in the world that can equal it for that waiter gets around like a langley flying machine remarked the man from topaz city thirstily we ve got men in our town too worth there s old bill withers and colonel metcalf and have you seen broadway at night asked the new yorker courteously there are few streets in the world that can compare with it when the electrics are shining and the pavements are alive with two hurrying streams of elegantly clothed men and beautiful women attired in the costliest costumes that wind in and out in a close maze of expensively never knew but one case in topaz city said the man from the west jim bailey our mayor had his watch and chain and in cash taken from his pocket while that s another matter said the new yorker while you are in our city you should avail yourself of every opportunity to see its wonders our rapid transit system if you was out in topaz broke in the man from there i could show you a whole cemetery full of people that got killed accidentally talking about mangling folks up why when berry rogers turned loose that old double barrelled shot gun of his loaded with slugs at anybody here waiter called the new yorker two more of the same it is acknowledged by every one that our city is the centre of art and literature and learning take for instance our after dinner speakers where else in the country would you find such wit and eloquence as emanate from depew and ford and if you take the papers interrupted the westerner you must have read of pete webster s daughter the websters live two blocks north of the court house in topaz city miss tillie webster she slept forty days and nights without waking up the doctors said that pass the matches please said the new yorker have you observed the expedition with which new buildings are being run up in new york improved inventions in steel framework and i noticed said the nevadian that the statistics of topaz city showed only one carpenter crushed by falling timbers last year and he was caught in a cyclone they abuse our sky line continued the new yorker and it is likely that we are not yet artistic in the construction of our buildings but i can safely assert that we lead in pictorial and decorative art in some of our houses can be found masterpieces in the way of paintings and sculpture one who has the entree to our best galleries will find back up exclaimed the man from topaz city there was a game last month in our town in which changed hands on a pair of ta romt tara went the orchestra the stage curtain blushing pink at the name asbestos inscribed upon it came down with a slow midsummer movement the audience trickled leisurely down the elevator and stairs on the sidewalk below the new yorker and the man from topaz city shook hands with alcoholic gravity the elevated crashed raucously surface cars hummed and clanged cabmen swore newsboys shrieked wheels clattered ear piercingly the new yorker conceived a happy thought with which he aspired to clinch the pre eminence of his city you must admit said he that in the way of noise new york is far ahead of any other back to the everglades said the man from topaz city in when sousa s band and the repeating candidate were in our town you couldn t the rattle of an express wagon drowned the rest of the words holding up a train note the man who told me these things was for several years an outlaw in the southwest and a follower of the pursuit he so frankly describes his description of the modus operandi should prove interesting his counsel of value to the potential passenger in some future hold up while his estimate of the pleasures of train robbing will hardly induce any one to adopt it as a profession i give the story in almost exactly his own words o h most people would say if their opinion was asked for that holding up a train would be a hard job well it isn t it s easy i have contributed some to the uneasiness of railroads and the insomnia of express companies and the most trouble i ever had about a hold up was in being swindled by unscrupulous people while spending the money i got the danger wasn t anything to speak of and we didn t mind the trouble one man has come pretty near robbing a train by himself two have succeeded a few times three can do it if they are hustlers but five is about the right number the time to do it and the place depend upon several things the first stick up i was ever in happened in maybe the way i got into it will explain how most train robbers start in the business five out of six western outlaws are just cowboys out of a job and gone wrong the sixth is a tough from the east who dresses up like a bad man and plays some low down trick that gives the boys a bad name wire fences and nesters made five of them a bad heart made the sixth jim s and i were working on the ranch in colorado the nesters had the cowman on t he go they had taken up the land and elected officers who were hard to get along with jim and i rode into la junta one day going south from a round up we were having a little fun without malice toward any body when a farmer administration cut in and tried to harvest us jim shot a deputy marshal and i kind of corroborated his side of the argument we skirmished up and down the main street the boomers having bad luck all the time after a while we leaned forward and shoved for the ranch down on the ceriso we were riding a couple of horses that couldn t fly but they could catch birds a few days after that a gang of the la junta boomers came to the ranch and wanted us to go back with them naturally we declined we had the house on them and before we were done refusing that old dobe was plumb full of lead when dark came we fagged em a batch of bullets and shoved out the back door for the rocks they sure smoked us as we went we had to drift which we did and rounded up down in oklahoma well there wasn t anything we could get there and being mighty hard up we decided to transact a little business with the railroads jim and i joined forces with tom and ike moore two brothers who had plenty of sand they were willing to convert into dust i can call their names for both of them are dead tom was shot while robbing a bank in arkansas ike was killed during the more dangerous pastime of attending a dance in the creek nation we selected a place on the santa fe where there was a bridge across a deep creek surrounded by heavy timber all passenger trains took water at the tank close to one end of the bridge it was a quiet place the nearest house being five miles away the day before it happened we rested our horses and made medicine as to how we should get about it our plans were not at all elaborate as none of us had ever engaged in a hold up before the santa fe flyer was due at the tank at p m at eleven tom and i lay down on one side of the track and jim and ike took the other as the train rolled up the headlight flashing far down the track and the steam hissing from the engine i turned weak all over i would have worked a whole year on the ranch for nothing to have been out of that affair right then some of the nerviest men in the business have told me that they felt the same way the first time the engine had hardly stopped when i jumped on the running board on one side while jim mounted the other as soon as the engineer and fireman saw our guns they threw up their hands without being told and begged us not to shoot saying they would do anything we wanted them to hit the ground i ordered and they both jumped off we drove them before us down the side of the train while this was happening tom and ike had been blazing away one on each side of the train yelling like apaches so as to keep the passengers herded in the cars some fellow stuck a little twenty two calibre out one of the coach windows and fired it straight up in the air i let drive and smashed the glass just over his head that settled everything like resistance from that direction by this time all my nervousness was gone i felt a kind of pleasant excitement as if i were at a dance or a frolic of some sort the lights were all out in the coaches and as tom and ike gradually quit firing and yelling it got to be almost as still as a graveyard i remember hearing a little bird chirping in a bush at the side of the track as if it were complaining at being waked up i made the fireman get a lantern and then i went to the express car and yelled to the messenger to open up or get perforated he slid the door back and stood in it with his hands up jump overboard son i said and he hit the dirt like a lump of lead there were two safes in the car a big one and a little one by the way i first located the messenger s arsenal a double barrelled shot gun with buckshot cartridges and a thirty eight in a drawer i drew the cartridges from the shot gun pocketed the pistol and called the messenger inside i shoved my gun against his nose and put him to work he couldn t open the big safe but he did the little one there was only nine hundred dollars in it that was mighty small winnings for our trouble so we decided to go through the passengers we took our prisoners to the smoking car and from there sent the engineer through the train to light up the coaches beginning with the first one we placed a man at each door and ordered the passengers to stand between the seats with their hands up if you want to find out what cowards the majority of men are all you have to do is rob a passenger train i don t mean because they don t resist i ll tell you later on why they can t do that but it makes a man feel sorry for them the way they lose their heads big burly drummers and farmers and ex soldiers and high collared dudes and sports that a few moments before were filling the car with noise and bragging get so scared that their ears flop there were very few people in the day coaches at that time of night so we made a slim haul until we got to the sleeper the pullman conductor met me at one door while jim was going round to the other one he very politely informed me that i could not go into that car as it did not belong to the railroad company and besides the passengers had already been greatly disturbed by the shouting and firing never in all my life have i met with a finer instance of official dignity and reliance upon the power of mr pull man s great name i jabbed my six shooter so hard against mr conductor s front that i afterward found one of his vest buttons so firmly wedged in the end of the barrel that i had to shoot it out he just shut up like a weak springed knife and rolled down the car steps i opened the door of the sleeper and stepped inside a big fat old man came wabbling up to me puffing and blowing he had one coat sleeve on and was trying to put his vest on over that i don t know who he thought i was young man young man says he you must keep cool and not get excited above everything keep cool i can t says i excitement s just eating me up and then i let out a yell and turned loose my forty five through the skylight that old man tried to dive into one of the lower berths but a screech came out of it and a bare foot that took him in the bread basket and landed him on the floor i saw jim coming in the other door and i hollered for everybody to climb out and line up they commenced to scramble down and for a while we had a three ringed circus the men looked as frightened and tame as a lot of rabbits in a deep snow they had on on an average about a quarter of a suit of clothes and one shoe apiece one chap was sitting on the floor of the aisle looking as if he were working a hard sum in arithmetic he was trying very solemn to pull a lady s number two shoe on his number nine foot the ladies didn t stop to dress they were so curious to see a real live train robber bless em that they just wrapped blankets and sheets around themselves and came out squeaky and fidgety looking they always show more curiosity and sand than the men do we got them all lined up and pretty quiet and i went through the bunch i found very little on them i mean in the way of valuables one man in the line was a sight he was one of those big overgrown solemn snoozers that sit on the platform at lectures and look wise before crawling out he had managed to put on his long frock tailed coat and his high silk hat the rest of him was nothing but pajamas and bunions when i dug into that prince albert i expected to drag out at least a block of gold mine stock or an armful of government bonds but all i found was a little boy s french harp about four inches long what it was there for i don t know i felt a little mad because he had fooled me so i stuck the harp up against his mouth if you can t pay play i says i can t play says he then learn right off quick says i letting him smell the end of my gun barrel he caught hold of the harp turned red as a beet and commenced to blow he blew a dinky little tune i remembered hearing when i was a kid prettiest little gal in the country oh mammy and daddy told me so i made him keep on playing it all the time we were in the car now and then he d get weak and off the key and i d turn my gun on him and ask what was the matter with that little gal and whether he had any intention of going back on her which would make him start up again like sixty i think that old boy standing there in his silk hat and bare feet playing his little french harp was the funniest sight i ever saw one little red headed woman in the line broke out laughing at him you could have heard her in the next car then jim held them steady while i searched the berths i grappled around in those beds and filled a pillow case with the strangest assortment of stuff you ever saw now and then i d come across a little pop gun pistol just about right for plugging teeth with which i d throw out the window when i finished with the collection i dumped the pillow case load in the middle of the aisle there were a good many watches bracelets rings and pocket books with a sprinkling of false teeth whiskey flasks fa ce powder boxes chocolate caramels and heads of hair of various colours and lengths there were also about a dozen ladies stockings into which jewellery watches and rolls of bills had been stuffed and then wadded up tight and stuck under the mattresses i offered to return what i called the scalps saying that we were not indians on the war path but none of the ladies seemed to know to whom the hair belonged one of the women and a good looker she was wrapped in a striped blanket saw me pick up one of the stockings that was pretty chunky and heavy about the toe and she snapped out that s mine sir you re not in the business of robbing women are you now as this was our first hold up we hadn t agreed upon any code of ethics so i hardly knew what to answer but anyway i replied well not as a specialty if this contains your personal property you can have it back it just does she declared eagerly and reached out her hand for it you ll excuse my taking a look at the contents i said holding the stocking up by the toe out dumped a big gent s gold watch worth two hundred a gent s leather pocket book that we afterward found to contain six hundred dollars a calibre revolver and the only thing of the lot that could have been a lady s personal property was a silver bracelet worth about fifty cents i said madame here s your property and handed her the bracelet now i went on how can you expect us to act square with you when you try to deceive us in this manner i m surprised at such conduct the young woman flushed up as if she had been caught doing something dishonest some other woman down the line called out the mean thing i never knew whether she meant the other lady or me when we finished our job we ordered everybody back to bed told em good night very politely at the door and left we rode forty miles before daylight and then divided the stuff each one of us got in money we lumped the jewellery around then we scattered each man for himself that was my first train robbery and it was about as easily done as any of the ones that followed but that was the last and only time i ever went through the passengers i don t like that part of the business afterward i stuck strictly to the express car during the next eight years i handled a good deal of money the best haul i made was just seven years after the first one we found out about a train that was going to bring out a lot of money to pay off the soldiers at a government post we stuck that train up in broad daylight five of us lay in the sand hills near a little station ten soldiers were guarding the money on the train but they might just as well have been at home on a furlough we didn t even allow them to stick their heads out the windows to see the fun we had no trouble at all in getting the money which was all in gold of course a big howl was raised at the time about the robbery it was government stuff and the government got sarcastic and wanted to know what the convoy of soldiers went along for the only excuse given was that nobody was expecting an attack among those bare sand hills in daytime i don t know what the government thought about the excuse but i know that it was a good one the surprise that is the keynote of the train robbing business the papers published all k inds of stories about the loss finally agreeing that it was between nine thousand and ten thousand dollars the government sawed wood here are the correct figures printed for the first time forty eight thousand dollars if anybody will take the trouble to look over uncle sam s private accounts for that little debit to profit and loss he will find that i am right to a cent by that time we were expert enough to know what to do we rode due west twenty miles making a trail that a broadway policeman could have followed and then we doubled back hiding our tracks on the second night after the hold up while posses were scouring the country in every direction jim and i were eating supper in the second story of a friend s house in the town where the alarm started from our friend pointed out to us in an office across the street a printing press at work striking off handbills offering a reward for our capture i have been asked what we do with the money we get well i never could account for a tenth part of it after it was spent it goes fast and freely an outlaw has to have a good many friends a highly respected citizen may and often does get along with very few but a man on the dodge has got to have sidekickers with angry posses and reward hungry officers cutting out a hot trail for him he must have a few places scattered about the country where he can stop and feed himself and his horse and get a few hours sleep without having to keep both eyes open when he makes a haul he feels like dropping some of the coin with these friends and he does it liberally sometimes i have at the end of a hasty visit at one of these havens of refuge flung a handful of gold and bills into the laps of the kids playing on the floor without knowing whether my contribution was a hundred dollars or a thousand when old timers make a big haul they generally go far away to one of the big cities to spend their money green hands however successful a hold up they make nearly always give themselves away by showing too much money near the place where they got it i was in a job in where we got twenty thousand dollars we followed our favourite plan for a get away that is doubled on our trail and laid low for a time near the scene of the train s bad luck one morning i picked up a newspaper and read an article with big headlines stating that the marshal with eight deputies and a posse of thirty armed citizens had the train robbers surrounded in a mesquite thicket on the cimarron and that it was a question of only a few hours when they would be dead men or prisoners while i was reading that article i was sitting at breakfast in one of the most elegant private residences in washington city with a flunky in knee pants standing behind my chair jim was sitting across the table talking to his half uncle a retired naval officer whose name you have often seen in the accounts of doings in the capital we had gone there and bought rattling outfits of good clothes and were resting from our labours among the nabobs we must have been killed in that mesquite thicket for i can make an affidavit that we didn t surrender now i propose to tell why it is easy to hold up a train and then why no one should ever do it in the first place the attacking party has all the advantage that is of course supposing that they are old timers with the necessary experience and courage they have the outside and are protected by the darkness while the others are in the light hemmed into a small space and exposed the moment they show a head at a window or door to the aim of a man who is a dead shot and who won t hesitate to shoot but in my opinion the main condition that makes train robbing easy is the element of surprise in connection with the imagination of the passengers if you have ever seen a horse that has eaten loco weed you will understand what i mean when i say that the passengers get locoed that horse gets the awfullest imagination on him in the world you can t coax him to cross a little branch stream two feet wide it looks as big to him as the mississippi river that s just the way with the passenger he thinks there are a hundred men yelling and shooting outside when maybe there are only two or three and the muzzle of a forty five looks like the entrance to a tunnel the passenger is all right although he may do mean little tricks like hiding a wad of money in his shoe and forgetting to dig up until you jostle his ribs some with the end of your six shooter but there s no harm in him as to the train crew we never had any more trouble with them than if they had been so many sheep i don t mean that they are cowards i mean that they have got sense they know they re not up against a bluff it s the same way with the officers i ve seen secret service men marshals and railroad detectives fork over their change as meek as moses i saw one of the bravest marshals i ever knew hide his gun under his seat and dig up along with the rest while i was taking toll he wasn t afraid he simply knew that we had the drop on the whole outfit besides many of those officers have families and they feel that they oughtn t to take chances whereas death has no terrors for the man who holds up a train he expects to get killed some day and he generally does my advice to you if you should ever be in a hold up is to line up with the cowards and save your bravery for an occasion when it may be of some benefit to you another reason why officers are backward about mixing things with a train robber is a financial one every time there is a scrimmage and somebody gets killed the officers lose money if the train robber gets away they swear out a warrant against john doe et al and travel hundreds of miles and sign vouchers for thousands on the trail of the fugitives and the government foots the bills so with them it is a question of mileage rather than courage i will give one instance to support my statement that the surprise is the best card in playing for a hold up along in the daltons were cutting out a hot trail for the officers down in the cherokee nation those were their lucky days and they got so reckless and sandy that they used to announce before hand what job they were going to undertake once they gave it out that they were going to hold up the m k t flyer on a certain night at the station of pryor creek in indian territory that night the railroad company got fifteen deputy marshals in muscogee and put them on the train beside them they had fifty armed men hid in the depot at pryor creek when the katy flyer pulled in not a dalton showed up the next station was adair six miles away when the train reached there and the deputies were having a good time explaining what they would have done to the dalton gang if they had turned up all at once it sounded like an army firing outside the conductor and brakeman came running into the car yelling train robbers some of those deputies lit out of the door hit the ground and kept on running some of them hid their winchesters under the seats two of them made a fight and were both killed it took the daltons just ten minutes to capture the train and whip the escort in twenty minutes more they robbed the express car of twenty seven thousand dollars and made a clean get away my opinion is that those deputies would have put up a stiff fight at pryor creek where they were expecting trouble but they were taken by surprise and locoed at adair just as the daltons who knew their business expected they would i don t think i ought to close without giving some deductions from my experience of eight years on the dodge it doesn t pay to rob trains leaving out the question of right and morals which i don t think i ought to tackle there is very little to envy in the life of an outlaw after a while money ceases to have any value in his eyes he gets to looking upon the railroads and express companies as his bankers and his six shooter as a cheque book good for any amount he throws away money right and left most of the time he is on the jump riding day and night and he lives so hard between times that he doesn t enjoy the taste of high life when he gets it he knows that his time is bound to come to lose his life or liberty and that the accuracy of his aim the speed of his horse and the fidelity of his sider are all that postpone the inevitable it isn t that he loses any sleep over danger from the officers of the law in all my experience i never knew officers to attack a band of outlaws unless they outnumbered them at least three to one but the outlaw carries one thought constantly in his mind and that is what makes him so sore against life more than anything else he knows where the marshals get their recruits of deputies he knows that the majority of these upholders of the law were once lawbreakers horse thieves rustlers highwaymen and outlaws like himself and that they gamed their positions and immunity by turning state s evidence by turning traitor and delivering up their comrades to imprisonment and death he knows that some day unless he is shot first his judas will set to work the trap will be laid and he will be the surprised instead of a surpriser at a stick up that is why the man who holds up trains picks his company with a thousand times the care with which a careful girl chooses a sweetheart that is why he raises himself from his blanket of nights and listens to the tread of every horse s hoofs on the distant road that is why he broods suspiciously for days upon a jesting remark or an unusual movement of a tried comrade or the broken mutterings of his closest friend sleeping by his side and it is one of the reasons why the train robbing profession is not so pleasant a one as either of its collateral branches politics or cornering the market ulysses and the dogman do you know the time of the dogmen when the forefinger of twilight begins to smudge the clear drawn lines of the big city there is inaugurated an hour devoted to one of the most melancholy sights of urban life out from the towering flat crags and apartment peaks of the cliff dwellers of new york steals an army of beings that were once men even yet they go upright upon two limbs and retain human form and speech but you will observe that they are behind animals in progress each of these beings follows a dog to which he is fastened by an artificial ligament these men are all victims to circe not willingly do they become flunkeys to fido bell boys to bull terriers and toddlers after towzer modern circe instead of turning them into animals has kindly left the difference of a six foot leash between them every one of those dogmen has been either cajoled bribed or commanded by his own particular circe to take the dear household pet out for an airing by their faces and manner you can tell that the dogmen are bound in a hopeless enchantment never will there come even a dog catcher ulysses to remove the spell the faces of some are stonily set they are past the commiseration the curiosity or the jeers of their fellow beings years of matrimony of continuous compulsory canine constitutionals have made them callous they unwind their beasts from lamp posts or the ensnared legs of profane pedestrians with the stolidity of mandarins manipulating the strings of their kites others more recently reduced to the ranks of rover s retinue take their medicine sulkily and fiercely they play the dog on the end of their line with the pleasure felt by the girl out fishing when she catches a sea robin on her hook they glare at you threateningly if you look at them as if it would be their delight to let slip the dogs of war these are half mutinous dogmen not quite circe ized and you will do well not to kick their charges should they sniff around your ankles others of the tribe do not seem to feel so keenly they are mostly unfresh youths with gold caps and drooping cigarettes who do not harmonize with their dogs the animals they attend wear satin bows in their collars and the young men steer them so assiduously that you are tempted to the theory that some personal advantage contingent upon satisfactory service waits upon the execution of their duties the dogs thus personally conducted are of many varieties but they are one in fatness in pampered diseased vileness of temper in insolent snarling capriciousness of behaviour they tug at the leash fractiously they make leisurely nasal inventory of every door step railing and post they sit down to rest when they choose they wheeze like the winner of a third avenue beefsteak eating contest they blunder clumsily into open cellars and coal holes they lead the dogmen a merry dance these unfortunate dry nurses of dogdom the cur cuddlers mongrel managers spitz stalkers poodle pullers skye scrapers dachshund dandlers terrier trailers and pomeranian pushers of the cliff dwelling circes follow their charges meekly the doggies neither fear nor respect them masters of the house these men whom they hold in leash may be but they are not masters of them from cosey corner to fire escape from divan to dumbwaiter doggy s snarl easily drives this two legged being who is commissioned to walk at the other end of his string during his outing one twilight the dogmen came forth as usual at their circes pleading guerdon or crack of the whip one among them was a strong man apparently of too solid virtues for this airy vocation his expression was melancholic his manner depressed he was leashed to a vile white dog loathsomely fat fiendishly ill natured gloatingly intractable toward his despised conductor at a corner nearest to his apartment house the dogman turned down a side street hoping for fewer witnesses to his ignominy the surfeited beast waddled before him panting with spleen and the labour of motion suddenly the dog stopped a tall brown long coated wide brimmed man stood like a colossus blocking the sidewalk and declaring well i m a son of a gun jim berry breathed the dogman with exclamation points in his voice sam telfair cried wide brim again you ding basted old willy walloo give us your hoof their hands clasped in the brief

the leash was slightly wrenched the shrieks of the awakened beast rang for a block around if that s your dog said jim when they were on the street again what s to hinder you from running that habeas corpus you ve got around his neck over a limb and walking off and forgetting him i d never dare to said the dogman awed at the bold proposition he sleeps in the bed i sleep on a lounge he runs howling

that was before i was dogmatized does misses telfair began jim hush said the dogman here s another cafe they lined up at the bar the dog fell asleep at their feet whiskey said jim make it two said the dogman i thought about you said jim when i bought that wild land i wished you was out there to help me with the stock last tuesday said the dogman he bit me on the ankle because i asked for cream in

s a straight forty miles of wire on one side of it you pass through the kitchen to get to the bedroom said the dogman and you pass through the parlour to get to the bath room and you back out through the dining room to get into the bedroom so you can turn around and leave by the kitchen and he snores and barks in his sleep and i have to smoke in the park on account of his asthma don t missis telfair began jim oh shut up said the dogman what is it this time whiskey said jim make it two said the dogman well i ll be racking along down toward the ferry said the other come on there you mangy turtle backed snake headed bench legged ton and a half of soap grease shouted the dogman with a new note in his voice and a new hand on the leash the dog scrambled after them with an angry whine at such unusual language from his guardian at the foot of twenty third street the dogman led the way through swinging doors last chance said he speak up whiskey said jim make it two said the dogman i don

the ranchman stepped to the ticket window suddenly the swift landing of three or four heavy kicks was heard the air was rent by piercing canine shrieks and a pained outraged lubberly bow legged pudding of a dog ran frenziedly up the street alone ticket to denver said jim make it two shouted the ex dogman reaching for his inside pocket the champion of the weather if you should speak of the kiowa reservation to the average new yorker he probably wouldn t know whether you were referring to a new political dodge at albany or a leitmotif from parsifal but out in the kiowa reservation advices have been received concerning the existence of new york a party of us were on a hunting trip in the reservation bud kingsbury our guide philosopher and friend was broiling antelope steaks in camp one night one of the party a pinkish haired young man in a correct hunting costume sauntered over to the fire to light a cigarette and remarked carelessly to bud nice night why yes said bud as nice as any night could be that ain t received the broadway stamp of approval now the young man was from new york but the rest of us wondered how bud guessed it so when the steaks were done we besought him to lay bare his system of ratiocination and as bud was something of a territorial talking machine he made oration as follows how did i know he was from new york well i figured it out as

falcon established his headquarters in one of the rooms of the casa morena here for a week he held informal sittings much as if he were a kind of unified grand jury and summoned before him all those whose testimony might illumine the financial tragedy that had accompanied the less momentous one of the late president s death two or three who were thus examined among whom was the barber esteban declared that they had identified the body of the president before its burial of a truth testified esteban before the mighty secretary it was he the president consider how could i shave a man and not see his face he sent for me to shave him in a small house he had a beard very black and thick had i ever seen the president before why not i saw him once ride forth in a carriage from the vapor in solitas when i shaved him he gave me a gold piece and said there was to be no talk but i am a liberal i am devoted to my country and i spake of these things to senor goodwin it is known said colonel falcon smoothly that the late president took with him an american leather valise containing a large amount of money did you see that de veras no esteban answered the light in the little house was but a small lamp by which i could scarcely see to shave the president such a thing there may have been but i did not see it no also in the room was a young lady a senorita of much beauty that i could see even in so small a light but the money senor or the thing in which it was carried that i did not see the comandante and other officers gave testimony that they had been awakened and alarmed by the noise of a pistol shot in the hotel de los extranjeros hurrying thither to protect the peace and dignity of the republic they found a man lying dead with a pistol clutched in his hand beside him was a young woman weeping sorely senor goodwin was also in the room when they entered it but of the valise of money they saw nothing madame timotea ortiz the proprietress of the hotel in which the game of fox in the morning had been played out told of the coming of the two guests to her house to my house they came said she one senor not quite old and one senorita of sufficient handsomeness they desired not to eat or to drink not even of my aguardiente which is the best to their rooms they ascended numero nueve and numero diez later came senor goodwin who ascended to speak with them then i heard a great noise like that of a canon and they said that the pobre presidente had shot himself esta bueno i saw nothing of money or of the thing you call veliz that you say he carried it in colonel falcon soon came to the reasonable conclusion that if any one in coralio could furnish a clue to the vanished money frank goodwin must be the man but the wise secretary pursued a different course in seeking information from the american goodwin was a powerful friend to the new administration and one who was not to be carelessly dealt with in respect to either his honesty or his courage even the private secretary of his excellency hesitated to have this rubber prince and mahogany baron haled before him as a common citizen of anchuria so he sent goodwin a flowery epistle each word petal dripping with honey requesting the favor of an interview goodwin replied with an invitation to dinner at his own house before the hour named the american walked over to the casa morena and greeted his guest frankly and friendly then the two strolled in the cool of the afternoon to goodwin s home in the environs the american left colonel falcon in a big cool shadowed room with a floor of inlaid and polished woods that any millionaire in the states would have envied excusing himself for a few minutes he crossed a patio shaded with deftly arranged awnings and plants and entered a long room looking upon the sea in the opposite wing of the house the broad jalousies were opened wide and the ocean breeze flowed in through the room an invisible current of coolness and health goodwin s wife sat near one of the windows making a water color sketch of the afternoon seascape here was a woman who looked to be happy and more she looked to be content had a poet been inspired to pen just similes concerning her favor he would have likened her full clear eyes with their white encircled gray irises to moonflowers with none of the goddesses whose traditional charms have become coldly classic would the discerning rhymester have compared her she was purely paradisaic not olympian if you can imagine eve after the eviction beguiling the flaming warriors and serenely reentering the garden you will have her just so human and still so harmonious with eden seemed mrs goodwin when her husband entered she looked up and her lips curved and parted her eyelids fluttered twice or thrice a movement remindful proesy forgive us of the tail wagging of a faithful dog and a little ripple went through her like the commotion set up in a weeping willow by a puff of wind thus she ever acknowledged his coming were it twenty times a day if they who sometimes sat over their wine in coralio reshaping old diverting stories of the madcap career of isabel guilbert could have seen the wife of frank goodwin that afternoon in the estimable aura of her happy wifehood they might have disbelieved or have agreed to forget those graphic annals of the life of the one for whom their president gave up his country and his honor i have brought a guest to dinner said goodwin one colonel falcon from san mateo he is come on government business i do not think you will care to see him so i prescribe for you one of those convenient and indisputable feminine headaches he has come to inquire about the lost money has he not asked mrs goodwin going on with her sketch a good guess acknowledged goodwin he has been holding an inquisition among the natives for three days i am next on his list of witnesses but as he feels shy about dragging one of uncle sam s subjects before him he consents to give it the outward appearance of a social function he will apply the torture over my own wine and provender has he found any one who saw the valise of money not a soul even madama ortiz whose eyes are so sharp for the sight of a revenue official does not remember that there was any baggage mrs goodwin laid down her brush and sighed i am so sorry frank she said that they are giving you so much trouble about the money but we can t let them know about it can we not without doing our intelligence a great injustice said goodwin with a smile and a shrug that he had picked up from the natives americano though i am they would have me in the calaboza in half an hour if they knew we had appropriated that valise no we must appear as ignorant about the money as the other ignoramuses in coralio do you think that this man they have sent suspects you she asked with a little pucker of her brows he d better not said the american carelessly it s lucky that no one caught a sight of the valise except myself as i was in the rooms when the shot was fired it is not surprising that they should want to investigate my part in the affair rather closely but there s no cause for alarm this colonel is down on the list of events for a good dinner with a dessert of american bluff that will end the matter i think mrs goodwin rose and walked to the window goodwin followed and stood by her side she leaned to him and rested in the protection of his strength as she had always rested since that dark night on which he had first made himself her tower of refuge thus they stood for a little while straight through the lavish growth of tropical branch and leaf and vine that confronted them had been cunningly trimmed a vista that ended at the cleared environs of coralio on the banks of the mangrove swamp at the other end of the aerial tunnel they could see the grave and wooden headpiece that bore the name of the unhappy president miraflores from this window when the rains forbade the open and from the green and shady slopes of goodwin s fruitful lands when the skies were smiling his wife was wont to look upon that grave with a gentle sadness that was now scarcely a mar to her happiness i loved him so frank she said even after that terrible flight and its awful ending and you have been so good to me and have made me so happy it has all grown into such a strange puzzle if they were to find out that we got the money do you think they would force you to make the amount good to the government they would undoubtedly try answered goodwin you are right about its being a puzzle and it must remain a puzzle to falcon and all his countrymen until it solves itself you and i who know more than any one else only know half of the solution we must not let even a hint about this money get abroad let them come to the theory that the president concealed it in the mountains during his journey or that he found means to ship it out of the country before he reached coralio i don t think that falcon suspects me he is making a closer investigation according to his orders but he will find out nothing thus they spake together had any one overheard or overseen them as they discussed the lost funds of anchuria there would have been a second puzzle presented for upon the faces and in the bearing of each of them was visible if countenances are to be believed saxon honesty and pride and honorable thoughts in goodwin s steady eye and firm lineaments molded into material shape by the inward spirit of kindness and generosity and courage there was nothing reconcilable with his words as for his wife physiognomy championed her even in the face of their accusive talk nobility was in her guise purity was in her glance the devotion that she manifested had not even the appearance of that feeling that now and then inspires a woman to share the guilt of her partner out of the pathetic greatness other love no there was a discrepancy here between what the eye would have seen and the ear have heard dinner was served to goodwin and his guest in the patio under cool foliage and flowers the american begged the illustrious secretary to excuse the absence of mrs goodwin who was suffering he said from a headache brought on by a slight calentura after the meal they lingered according to the custom over their coffee and cigars colonel falcon with true castilian delicacy waited for his host to open the question that they had met to discuss he had not long to wait as soon as the cigars were lighted the american cleared the way by inquiring whether the secretary s investigations in the town had furnished him with any clue to the lost funds i have found no one yet admitted colonel falcon who even had sight of the valise or the money yet i have persisted it has been proven in the capital that president miraflores set out from san mateo with one hundred thousand dollars belonging to the government accompanied by senorita isabel guilbert the opera singer the government officially and personally is loathe to believe concluded colonel falcon with a smile that our late president s tastes would have permitted him to abandon on the route as excess baggage either of the desirable articles with which his flight was burdened i suppose you would like to hear what i have to say about the affair said goodwin coming directly to the point it will not require many words on that night with others of our friends here i was keeping a lookout for the president having been notified of his flight by a telegram in our national cipher from englehart one of our leaders in the capital about ten o clock that night i saw a man and a woman hurrying along the streets they went to the hotel de los extranjeros and engaged rooms i followed them upstairs leaving esteban who had come up to watch outside the barber had told me that he had shaved the beard from the president s face that night therefore i was prepared when i entered the rooms to find him with a smooth face when i apprehended him in the name of the people he drew a pistol and shot himself instantly in a few minutes many officers and citizens were on the spot i suppose you have been informed of the subsequent facts goodwin paused losada s agent maintained an attitude of waiting as if he expected a continuance and now went on the american looking steadily into the eyes of the other man and giving each word a deliberate emphasis you will oblige me by attending carefully to what i have to add i saw no valise or receptacle of any kind or any money belonging to the republic of anchuria if president miraflores decamped with any funds belonging to the treasury of this country or to himself or to any one else i saw no trace of it in the house or elsewhere at that time or at any other does that statement cover the ground of the inquiry you wished to make of me colonel falcon bowed and described a fluent curve with his cigar his duty was performed goodwin was not to be disputed he was a loyal supporter of the government and enjoyed the full confidence of the new president his rectitude had been the capital that had brought him fortune in anchuria just as it had formed the lucrative graft of mellinger the secretary of miraflores i thank you senor goodwin said falcon for speaking plainly but senor goodwin i am instructed to pursue every clue that presents itself in this matter there is one that i have not yet touched upon our friends in france senor have a saying cherchez la femme when there is a mystery without a clue but here we do not have to search the woman who accompanied the late president in his flight must surely i must interrupt you there interposed goodwin it is true that when i entered the hotel for the purpose of intercepting president miraflores i found a lady there i must beg of you to remember that that lady is now my wife i speak for her as i do for myself she knows nothing of the fate of the valise or of the money that you are seeking you will say to his excellency that i guarantee her innocence i do not need to add to you colonel falcon that i do not care to have her questioned or disturbed colonel falcon bowed again por supuesto no he cried and to indicate that the inquiry was ended he added and now senor let me beg of you to show me that sea view from your galeria of which you spoke i am a lover of the sea in the early evening goodwin walked back to the town with his guest leaving him at the corner of the calle grande as he was returning homeward one beelzebub blythe with the air of a courtier and the outward aspect of a scarecrow pounced upon him hopefully from the door of a pulperia blythe had been re christened beelzebub as an acknowledgement of the greatness of his fall once in some distant paradise lost he had foregathered with the angels of the earth but fate had hurled him headlong down to the tropics where flamed in his bosom a fire that was seldom quenched in coralio they called him a beach comber but he was in reality a categorical idealist who strove to anamorphosize the dull verities of life by the means of brandy and rum as beelzebub himself might have held in his clutch with unwitting tenacity his harp or crown during his tremendous fall so his namesake had clung to his gold rimmed eyeglasses as the only souvenir of his lost estate these he wore with impressiveness and distinction while he combed beaches and extracted toll from his friends by some mysterious means he kept his drink reddened face always smoothly shaven for the rest he sponged gracefully upon whomsoever he could for enough to keep him pretty drunk and sheltered from the rains and night dews hallo goodwin called the derelict airily i was hoping i d strike you i wanted to see you particularly suppose we go where we can talk of course you know there s a chap down here looking up the money old miraflores lost yes said goodwin i ve been talking with him let s go into espada s place i can spare you ten minutes they went into the pulperia and sat at a little table upon stools with rawhide tops have a drink said goodwin they can t bring it too quickly said blythe i ve been in a drought ever since morning hi muchacho el aguardiente por aca now what do you want to see me about asked goodwin when the drinks were before them confound it old man drawled blythe why do you spoil a golden moment like this with business i wanted to see you well this has the preference he gulped down his brandy and gazed longingly into the empty glass have another suggested goodwin between gentlemen said the fallen angel i don t quite like your use of that word another it isn t quite delicate but the concrete idea that the word represents is not displeasing the glasses were refilled blythe sipped blissfully from his as he began to enter the state of a true idealist i must trot along in a minute or two hinted goodwin was there anything in particular blythe did not reply at once old losada would make it a hot country he remarked at length for the man who swiped that gripsack of treasury boodle don t you think undoubtedly he would agreed goodwin calmly as he rose leisurely to his feet i ll be running over to the house now old man mrs goodwin is alone there was nothing important you had to say was there that s all said blythe unless you wouldn t mind sending in another drink from the bar as you go out old espada has closed my account to profit and loss and pay for the lot will you like a good fellow all right said goodwin buenas noches beezlebub blythe lingered over his cups polishing his eyeglasses with a disreputable handkerchief i thought i could do it but i couldn t he muttered to himself after a time a gentleman can t blackmail the man that he drinks with viii the admiral spilled milk draws few tears from an anchurian administration many are its lacteal sources and the clocks hands point forever to milking time even the rich cream skimmed from the treasury by the bewitched miraflores did not cause the newly installed patriots to waste time in unprofitable regrets the government philosophically set about supplying the deficiency by increasing the import duties and by suggesting to wealthy private citizens that contributions according to their means would be considered patriotic and in order prosperity was expected to attend the reign of losada the new president the ousted office holders and military favorites organized a new liberal party and began to lay their plans for a re succession thus the game of anchurian politics began like a chinese comedy to unwind slowly its serial length here and there mirth peeps for an instant from the wings and illumines the florid lines a dozen quarts of champagne in conjunction with an informal sitting of the president and his cabinet led to the establishment of the navy and the appointment of felipe carrera as its admiral next to the champagne the credit of the appointment belongs to don sabas placido the newly confirmed minister of war the president had requested a convention of his cabinet for the discussion of questions politic and for the transaction of certain routine matters of state the session had been signally tedious the business and the wine prodigiously dry a sudden prankish humor of don sabas impelling him to the deed spiced the grave affairs of state with a whiff of agreeable playfulness in the dilatory order of business had come a bulletin from the coast department of orilla del mar reporting the seizure by the custom house officers at the town of coralio of the sloop estrella del noche and her cargo of drygoods patent medicines granulated sugar and three star brandy also six martini rifles and a barrel of american whiskey caught in the act of smuggling the sloop with its cargo was now according to law the property of the republic the collector of customs in making his report departed from the conventional forms so far as to suggest that the confiscated vessel be converted to the use of the government the prize was the first capture to the credit of the department in ten years the collector took opportunity to pat his department on the back it often happened that government officers required transportation from point to point along the coast and means were usually lacking furthermore the sloop could be manned by a loyal crew and employed as a coast guard to discourage the pernicious art of smuggling the collector also ventured to nominate one to whom the charge of the boat could be safely intrusted a young man of coralio felipe carrera not be it understood one of extreme wisdom but loyal and the best sailor along the coast it was upon this hint that the minister of war acted executing a rare piece of drollery that so enlivened the tedium of the executive session in the consultation of this small maritime banana republic was a forgotten section that provided for the maintenance of a navy this provision with many other wiser ones had lain inert since the establishment of the republic anchuria had no navy and had no use for one it was characteristic of don sabas a man at once merry learned whimsical and audacious that he should have disturbed the dust of this musty and sleeping statute to increase the humor of the world by so much as a smile from his indulgent colleagues with delightful mock seriousness the minister of war proposed the creation of a navy he argued its need and the glories it might achieve with such gay and witty zeal that the travesty overcame with its humor even the swart dignity of president losada himself the champagne was bubbling trickily in the veins of the mercurial statesmen it was not the custom of the grave governors of anchuria to enliven their sessions with a beverage so apt to cast a veil of disparagement over sober affairs the wine had been a thoughtful compliment tendered by the agent of the vesuvius fruit company as a token of amicable relations and certain consummated deals between that company and the republic of anchuria the jest was carried to its end a formidable official document was prepared encrusted with chromatic seals and jaunty with fluttering ribbons bearing the florid signatures of state this commission conferred upon el senor don felipe carrera the title of flag admiral of the republic of anchuria thus within the space of a few minutes and the dominion of a dozen extra dry the country took its place among the naval powers of the world and felipe carrera became entitled to a salute of nineteen guns whenever he might enter port the southern races are lacking in that particular kind of humor that finds entertainment in the defects and misfortunes bestowed by nature owing to this defect in their constitution they are not moved to laughter as are their northern brothers by the spectacle of the deformed the feeble minded or the insane felipe carrera was sent upon earth with but half his wits therefore the people of coralio called him el pobrecito loco the poor little crazed one saying that god had sent but half of him to earth retaining the other half a sombre youth glowering and speaking only at the rarest times felipe was but negatively loco on shore he generally refused all conversation he seemed to know that he was badly handicapped on land where so many kinds of understanding are needed but on the water his one talent set him equal with most men few sailors whom god had carefully and completely made could handle a sailboat as well five points nearer the wind than the best of them he could sail his sloop when the elements raged and set other men to cowering the deficiencies of felipe seemed of little importance he was a perfect sailor if an imperfect man he owned no boat but worked among the crews of the schooners and sloops that skimmed the coast trading and freighting fruit out to the steamers where there was no harbor it was through his famous skill and boldness on the sea as well as for the pity felt for his mental imperfections that he was recommended by the collector as a suitable custodian of the captured sloop when the outcome of don sabas little pleasantry arrived in the form of the imposing and preposterous commission the collector smiled he had not expected such prompt and overwhelming response to his recommendation he despatched a muchacho at once to fetch the future admiral the collector waited in his official quarters his office was in the calle grande and the sea breezes hummed through its windows all day the collector in white linen and canvas shoes philandered with papers on an antique desk a parrot perched on a pen rack seasoned the official tedium with a fire of choice castilian imprecations two rooms opened into the collector s in one the clerical force of young men of variegated complexions transacted with glitter and parade their several duties through the open door of the other room could be seen a bronze babe guiltless of clothing that rollicked upon the floor in a grass hammock a thin woman tinted a pale lemon played a guitar and swung contentedly in the breeze thus surrounded by the routine of his high duties and the visible tokens of agreeable domesticity the collector s heart was further made happy by the power placed in his hands to brighten the fortunes of the innocent felipe felipe came and stood before the collector he was a lad of twenty not ill favored in looks but with an expression of distant and pondering vacuity he wore white cotton trousers down the seams of which he had sewed red stripes with some vague aim at military decoration a flimsy blue shirt fell open at his throat his feet were bare he held in his hand the cheapest of straw hats from the states senor carrera said the collector gravely producing the showy commission i have sent for you at the president s bidding this document that i present to you confers upon you the title of admiral of this great republic and gives you absolute command of the naval forces and fleet of our country you may think friend felipe that we have no navy but yes the sloop the estrella del noche that my brave men captured from the coast smugglers is to be placed under your command the boat is to be devoted to the services of your country you will be ready at all times to convey officials of the government to points along the coast where they may be obliged to visit you will also act as a coast guard to prevent as far as you may be able the crime of smuggling you will uphold the honor and prestige of your country at sea and endeavor to place anchuria among the proudest naval powers of the world these are your instructions as the minister of war desires me to convey them to you por dios i do not know how all this is to be accomplished for not one word did his letter contain in respect to a crew or to the expenses of this navy perhaps you are to provide a crew yourself senor admiral i do not know but it is a very high honor that has descended upon you i now hand you your commission when you are ready for the boat i will give orders that she shall be made over into your charge that is as far as my instructions go felipe took the commission that the collector handed to him he gazed through the open window at the sea for a moment with his customary expression of deep but vain pondering then he turned without having spoken a word and walked swiftly away through the hot sand of the street pobrecito loco sighed the collector and the parrot on the pen racks screeched loco loco loco the next morning a strange procession filed through the streets to the collector s office at its head was the admiral of the navy somewhere felipe had raked together a pitiful semblance of a military uniform a pair of red trousers a dingy blue short jacket heavily ornamented with gold braid and an old fatigue cap that must have been cast away by one of the british soldiers in belize and brought away by felipe on one of his coasting voyages buckled around his waist was an ancient ship s cutlass contributed to his equipment by pedro lafitte the baker who proudly asserted its inheritance from his ancestor the illustrious buccaneer at the admiral s heels tagged his newly shipped crew three grinning glossy black caribs bare to the waist the sand spurting in showers from the spring of their naked feet briefly and with dignity felipe demanded his vessel of the collector and now a fresh honor awaited him the collector s wife who played the guitar and read novels in the hammock all day had more than a little romance in her placid yellow bosom she had found in an old book an engraving of a flag that purported to be the naval flag of anchuria perhaps it had so been designed by the founders of the nation but as no navy had ever been established oblivion had claimed the flag laboriously with her own hands she had made a flag after the pattern a red cross upon a blue and white ground he presented it to felipe with these words brave sailor this flag is of your country be true and defend it with your life go you with god for the first time since his appointment the admiral showed a flicker of emotion he took the silken emblem and passed his hand reverently over its surface i am the admiral he said to the collector s lady being on land he could bring himself to no more exuberant expression of sentiment at sea with the flag at the masthead of his navy some more eloquent exposition of feelings might be forthcoming abruptly the admiral departed with his crew for the next three days they were busy giving the estrella del noche a new coat of white paint trimmed with blue and then felipe further adorned himself by fastening a handful of brilliant parrot s plumes in his cap again he tramped with his faithful crew to the collector s office and formally notified him that the sloop s name had been changed to el nacional during the next few months the navy had its troubles even an admiral is perplexed to know what to do without any orders but none came neither did any salaries el nacional swung idly at anchor when felipe s little store of money was exhausted he went to the collector and raised the question of finances salaries exclaimed the collector with hands raised valgame dios not one centavo of my own pay have i received for the last seven months the pay of an admiral do you ask quien sabe should it be less than three thousand pesos mira you will see a revolution in this country very soon a good sign of it is when the government calls all the time for pesos pesos pesos and pays none out felipe left the collector s office with a look almost of content on his sombre face a revolution would mean fighting and then the government would need his services it was rather humiliating to be an admiral without anything to do and have a hungry crew at your heels begging for reales to buy plantains and tobacco with when he returned to where his happy go lucky caribs were waiting they sprang up and saluted as he had drilled them to do come muchachos said the admiral it seems that the government is poor it has no money to give us we will earn what we need to live upon thus will we serve our country soon his heavy eyes almost lighted up it may gladly call upon us for help thereafter el nacional turned out with the other coast craft and became a wage earner she worked with the lighters freighting bananas and oranges out to the fruit steamers that could not approach nearer than a mile from the shore surely a self supporting navy deserves red letters in the budget of any nation after earning enough at freighting to keep himself and his crew in provisions for a week felipe would anchor the navy and hang about the little telegraph office looking like one of the chorus of an insolvent comic opera troupe besieging the manager s den a hope for orders from the capital was always in his heart that his services as admiral had never been called into requirement hurt his pride and patriotism at every call he would inquire gravely and expectantly for despatches the operator would pretend to make a search and then reply not yet it seems senor el almirante poco tiempo outside in the shade of the lime trees the crew chewed sugar cane or slumbered well content to serve a country that was contented with so little service one day in the early summer the revolution predicted by the collector flamed out suddenly it had long been smoldering at the first note of alarm the admiral of the navy force and fleet made all sail for a larger port on the coast of a neighboring republic where he traded a hastily collected cargo of fruit for its value in cartridges for the five martini rifles the only guns that the navy could boast then to the telegraph office sped the admiral sprawling in his favorite corner in his fast decaying uniform with his prodigious sabre distributed between his red legs he waited for the long delayed but now soon expected orders not yet senor el almirante the telegraph clerk would call to him poco tiempo at the answer the admiral would plump himself down with a great rattling of scabbard to await the infrequent tick of the little instrument on the table they will come would be his unshaken reply i am the admiral ix the flag paramount at the head of the insurgent party appeared that hector and learned theban of the southern republics don sabas placido a traveller a soldier a poet a scientist a statesman and a connoisseur the wonder was that he could content himself with the petty remote life of his native country it is a whim of placido s said a friend who knew him well to take up political intrigue it is not otherwise than as if he had come upon a new tempo in music a new bacillus in the air a new scent or rhyme or explosive he will squeeze this revolution dry of sensations and a week afterward will forget it skimming the seas of the world in his brigantine to add to his already world famous collections collections of what por dios of everything from postage stamps to prehistoric stone idols but for a mere dilettante the aesthetic placido seemed to be creating a lively row the people admired him they were fascinated by his brilliancy and flattered by his taking an interest in so small a thing as his native country they rallied to the call of his lieutenants in the capital where somewhat contrary to arrangements the army remained faithful to the government there was also lively skirmishing in the coast towns it was rumored that the revolution was aided by the vesuvius fruit company the power that forever stood with chiding smile and uplifted finger to keep anchuria in the class of good children two of its steamers the traveler and the salvador were known to have conveyed insurgent troops from point to point along the coast as yet there had been no actual uprising in coralio military law prevailed and the ferment was bottled for the time and then came the word that everywhere the revolutionists were encountering defeat in the capital the president s forces triumphed and there was a rumor that the leaders of the revolt had been forced to fly hotly pursued in the little telegraph office at coralio there was always a gathering of officials and loyal citizens awaiting news from the seat of government one morning the telegraph key began clicking and presently the operator called loudly one telegram for el almirante don senor felipe carrera there was a shuffling sound a great rattling of tin scabbard and the admiral prompt at his spot of waiting leaped across the room to receive it the message was handed to him slowly spelling it out he found it to be his first official order thus running proceed immediately with your vessel to mouth of rio ruiz transport beef and provisions to barracks at alforan martinez general small glory to be sure in this his country s first call but it had called and joy surged in the admiral s breast he drew his cutlass belt to another buckle hole roused his dozing crew and in a quarter of an hour el nacional was tacking swiftly down coast in a stiff landward breeze the rio ruiz is a small river emptying into the sea ten miles below coralio that portion of the coast is wild and solitary through a gorge in the cordilleras rushes the rio ruiz cold and bubbling to glide at last with breadth and leisure through an alluvial morass into the sea in two hours el nacional entered the river s mouth the banks were crowded with a disposition of formidable trees the sumptuous undergrowth of the tropics overflowed the land and drowned itself in the fallow waters silently the sloop entered there and met a deeper silence brilliant with greens and ochres and floral scarlets the umbrageous mouth of the rio ruiz furnished no sound or movement save of the sea going water as it purled against the prow of the vessel small chance there seemed of wresting beef or provisions from that empty solitude the admiral decided to cast anchor and at the chain s rattle the forest was stimulated to instant and resounding uproar the mouth of the rio ruiz had only been taking a morning nap parrots and baboons screeched and barked in the trees a whirring and a hissing and a booming marked the awakening of animal life a dark blue bulk was visible for an instant as a startled tapir fought his way through the vines the navy under orders hung in the mouth of the little river for hours the crew served the dinner of shark s fin soup plantains crab gumbo and sour wine the admiral with a three foot telescope closely scanned the impervious foliage fifty yards away it was nearly sunset when a reverberating hal lo o o came from the forest to their left it was answered and three men mounted upon mules crashed through the tropic tangle to within a dozen yards of the river s bank there they dismounted and one unbuckling his belt struck each mule a violent blow with his sword scabbard so that they with a fling of heels dashed back again into the forest those were strange looking men to be conveying beef and provisions one was a large and exceedingly active man of striking presence he was of the purest spanish type with curling gray besprinkled dark hair blue sparkling eyes and the pronounced air of a caballero grande the other two were small brown faced men wearing white military uniforms high riding boots and swords the clothes of all were drenched bespattered and rent by the thicket some stress of circumstance must have driven them diable a quatre through flood mire and jungle o he senor almirante called the large man send to us your boat the dory was lowered and felipe with one of the caribs rowed toward the left bank the large man stood near the water s brink waist deep in the curling vines as he gazed upon the scarecrow figure in the stern of the dory a sprightly interest beamed upon his mobile face months of wageless and thankless service had dimmed the admiral s splendor his red trousers were patched and ragged most of the bright buttons and yellow braid were gone from his jacket the visor of his cap was torn and depended almost to his eyes the admiral s feet were bare dear admiral cried the large man and his voice was like a blast from a horn i kiss your hands i knew we could build upon your fidelity you had our despatch from general martinez a little nearer with your boat dear admiral upon these devils of shifting vines we stand with the smallest security felipe regarded him with a stolid face provisions and beef for the barracks at alforan he quoted no fault of the butchers almirante mio that the beef awaits you not but you are come in time to save the cattle get us aboard your vessel senor at once you first caballeros a priesa come back for me the boat is too small the dory conveyed the two officers to the sloop and returned for the large man have you so gross a thing as food good admiral he cried when aboard and perhaps coffee beef and provisions nombre de dios a little longer and we could have eaten one of those mules that you colonel rafael saluted so feelingly with your sword scabbard at parting let us have food and then we will sail for the barracks at alforan no the caribs prepared a meal to which the three passengers of el nacional set themselves with famished delight about sunset as was its custom the breeze veered and swept back from the mountains cool and steady bringing a taste of the stagnant lagoons and mangrove swamps that guttered the lowlands the mainsail of the sloop was hoisted and swelled to it and at that moment they heard shouts and a waxing clamor from the bosky profundities of the shore the butchers my dear admiral said the large man smiling too late for the slaughter further than his orders to his crew the admiral was saying nothing the topsail and jib were spread and the sloop elided out of the estuary the large man and his companions had bestowed themselves with what comfort they could about the bare deck belike the thing big in their minds had been their departure from that critical shore and now that the hazard was so far reduced their thoughts were loosed to the consideration of further deliverance but when they saw the sloop turn and fly up coast again they relaxed satisfied with the course the admiral had taken the large man sat at ease his spirited blue eye engaged in the contemplation of the navy s commander he was trying to estimate this sombre and fantastic lad whose impenetrable stolidity puzzled him himself a fugitive his life sought and chafing under the smart of defeat and failure it was characteristic of him to transfer instantly his interest to the study of a thing new to him it was like him too to have conceived and risked all upon this last desperate and madcap scheme this message to a poor crazed fanatico cruising about with his grotesque uniform and his farcical title but his companions had been at their wits end escape had seemed incredible and now he was pleased with the success of the plan they had called crack brained and precarious the brief tropic twilight seemed to slide swiftly into the pearly splendor of a moonlit night and now the lights of coralio appeared distributed against the darkening shore to their right the admiral stood silent at the tiller the caribs like black panthers held the sheets leaping noiselessly at his short commands the three passengers were watching intently the sea before them and when at length they came in sight of the bulk of a steamer lying a mile out from the town with her lights radiating deep into the water they held a sudden voluble and close headed converse the sloop was speeding as if to strike midway between ship and shore the large man suddenly separated from his companions and approached the scarecrow at the helm my dear admiral he said the government has been exceedingly remiss i feel all the shame for it that only its ignorance of your devoted service has prevented it from sustaining an inexcusable oversight has been made a vessel a uniform and a crew worthy of your fidelity shall be furnished you but just now dear admiral there is business of moment afoot the steamer lying there is the salvador i and my friends desire to be conveyed to her where we are sent on the government s business do us the favor to shape your course accordingly without replying the admiral gave a sharp command and put the tiller hard to port el nacional swerved and headed straight as an arrow s course for the shore do me the favor said the large man a trifle restively to acknowledge at least that you catch the sound of my words it was possible that the fellow might be lacking in senses as well as intellect the admiral emitted a croaking harsh laugh and spake they will stand you he said with your face to a wall and shoot you dead that is the way they kill traitors i knew you when you stepped into my boat i have seen your picture in a book you are sabas placido traitor to your country with your face to a wall so you will die i am the admiral and i will take you to them with your face to a wall yes don sabas half turned and waved his hand with a ringing laugh toward his fellow fugitives to you caballeros i have related the history of that session when we issued that so ridiculous commission of a truth our jest has been turned against us behold the frankenstein s monster we have created don sabas glanced toward the shore the lights of coralio were drawing near he could see the beach the warehouse of the bodega nacional the long low cuartel occupied by the soldiers and behind that gleaming in the moonlight a stretch of high adobe wall he had seen men stood with their faces to that wall and shot dead again he addressed the extravagant figure at the helm it is true he said that i am fleeing the country but receive the assurance that i care very little for that courts and camps everywhere are open to sabas placido vaya what is this molehill of a republic this pig s head of a country to a man like me i am a paisano of everywhere in rome in london in paris in vienna you will hear them say welcome back don sabas come tonto baboon of a boy admiral whatever you call yourself turn your boat put us on board the salvador and here is your pay five hundred pesos in money of the estados unidos more than your lying government will pay you in twenty years don sabas pressed a plump purse against the youth s hand the admiral gave no heed to the words or the movement braced against the helm he was holding the sloop dead on her shoreward course his dull face was lit almost to intelligence by some inward conceit that seemed to afford him joy and found utterance in another parrot like cackle that is why they do it he said so that you will not see the guns they fire boom and you fall dead with your face to the wall yes the admiral called a sudden order to his crew the lithe silent caribs made fast the sheets they held and slipped down the hatchway into the hold of the sloop when the last one had disappeared don sabas like a big brown leopard leaped forward closed and fastened the hatch and stood smiling no rifles if you please dear admiral he said it was a whimsey of mine once to compile a dictionary of the carib lengua so i understood your order perhaps now you will he cut short his words for he heard the dull swish of iron scraping along tin the admiral had drawn the cutlass of pedro lafitte and was darting upon him the blade descended and it was only by a display of surprising agility that the large man escaped with only a bruised shoulder the glancing weapon he was drawing his pistol as he sprang and the next instant he shot the admiral down don sabas stooped over him and rose again in the heart he said briefly senores the navy is abolished colonel rafael sprang to the helm and the other officer hastened to loose the mainsail sheets the boom swung round el nacional veered and began to tack industriously for the salvador strike that flag senor called colonel rafael our friends on the steamer will wonder why we are sailing under it well said cried don sabas advancing to the mast he lowered the flag to the deck where lay its too loyal supporter thus ended the minister of war s little piece of after dinner drollery and by the same hand that began it suddenly don sabas gave a great cry of joy and ran down the slanting deck to the side of colonel rafael across his arm he carried the flag of the extinguished navy mire mire senor ah dios already can i hear that great bear of an oestreicher shout du hast mein herz gebrochen mire of my friend herr grunitz of vienna you have heard me relate that man has travelled to ceylon for an orchid to patagonia for a headdress to benares for a slipper to mozambique for a spearhead to add to his famous collections thou knowest also amigo rafael that i have been a gatherer of curios my collection of battle flags of the world s navies was the most complete in existence until last year then herr grunitz secured two such rare specimens one of a barberry state and one of the makarooroos a tribe on the west coast of africa i have not those but they can be procured but this flag senor do you know what it is name of god do you know see that red cross upon the blue and white ground you never saw it before seguramente no it is the naval flag of your country mire this rotten tub we stand upon is its navy that dead cockatoo lying there was its commander that stroke of cutlass and single pistol shot a sea battle all a piece of absurd foolery i grant you but authentic there has never been another flag like this and there never will be another no it is unique in the whole world yes think of what that means to a collector of flags do you know coronel mio how many golden crowns herr grunitz would give for this flag ten thousand likely well a hundred thousand would not buy it beautiful flag only flag little devil of a most heaven born flag o he old grumbler beyond the ocean wait till don sabas comes again to the konigin strasse he will let you kneel and touch the folds of it with one finger o he old spectacled ransacker of the world forgotten was the impotent revolution the danger the loss the gall of defeat possessed solely by the inordinate and unparalleled passion of the collector he strode up and down the little deck clasping to his breast with one hand the paragon of a flag he snapped his fingers triumphantly toward the east he shouted the paean to his prize in trumpet tones as though he would make old grunitz hear in his musty den beyond the sea they were waiting on the salvador to welcome them the sloop came close alongside the steamer where her sides were sliced almost to the lower deck for the loading of fruit the sailors of the salvador grappled and held her there captain mcleod leaned over the side well senor the jig is up i m told the jig is up don sabas looked perplexed for a moment that revolution ah yes with a shrug of his shoulders he dismissed the matter the captain learned of the escape and the imprisoned crew caribs he said no harm in them he slipped down into the sloop and kicked loose the hasp of the hatch the black fellows came tumbling up sweating but grinning hey black boys said the captain in a dialect of his own you sabe catchy boat and vamos back same place quick they saw him point to themselves the sloop and coralio yas yas they cried with broader grins and many nods the four don sabas the two officers and the captain moved to quit the sloop don sabas lagged a little behind looking at the still form of the late admiral sprawled in his paltry trappings pobrecito loco he said softly he was a brilliant cosmopolite and a cognoscente of high rank but after all he was of the same race and blood and instinct as this people even as the simple paisanos of coralio had said it so said don sabas without a smile he looked and said the poor little crazed one stooping he raised the limp shoulders drew the priceless and induplicable flag under them and over the breast pinning it there with the diamond star of the order of san carlos that he took from the collar of his own coat he followed after the others and stood with them upon the deck of the salvador the sailors that steadied el nacional shoved her off the jabbering caribs hauled away at the rigging the sloop headed for the shore and herr grunitz s collection of naval flags was still the finest in the world x the shamrock and the palm one night when there was no breeze and coralio seemed closer than ever to the gratings of avernus five men were grouped about the door of the photograph establishment of keogh and clancy thus in all the scorched and exotic places of the earth caucasians meet when the day s work is done to preserve the fulness of their heritage by the aspersion of alien things johnny atwood lay stretched upon the grass in the undress uniform of a carib and prated

in the hall i would like to talk with you a while mr pinkhammer if i may said the gentleman who remained very well if you care to i replied and will excuse me if i take it comfortably i am rather tired i stretched myself upon a couch by a window and lit a cigar he drew a chair nearby let us speak to the point he said soothingly your name is not pinkhammer i know that as well as you do i said coolly but a man must have a name of some sort i can assure you that i do not extravagantly admire the name of pinkhammer but when one christens one s self suddenly the fine names do not seem to suggest themselves but suppose it had been scheringhausen or scroggins i think i did very well with pinkhammer your name said the other man seriously is elwyn c bellford you are one of the first lawyers in denver you are suffering from an attack of aphasia which has caused you to forget your identity the cause of it was over application to your profession and perhaps a life too bare of natural recreation and pleasures the lady who has just left the room is your wife she is what i would call a fine looking woman i said after a judicial pause i particularly admire the shade of brown in her hair she is a wife to be proud of since your disappearance nearly two weeks ago she has scarcely closed her eyes we learned that you were in new york through a telegram sent by isidore newman a traveling man from denver he said that he had met you in a hotel here and that you did not recognize him i think i remember the occasion i said the fellow called me bellford if i am not mistaken but don t you think it about time now for you to introduce yourself i am robert volney doctor volney i have been your close friend for twenty years and your physician for fifteen i came with mrs bellford to trace you as soon as we got the telegram try elwyn old man try to remember what s the use to try i asked with a little frown you say you are a physician is aphasia curable when a man loses his memory does it return slowly or suddenly sometimes gradually and imperfectly sometimes as suddenly as it went will you undertake the treatment of my case doctor volney i asked old friend said he i ll do everything in my power and wil have done everything that science can do to cure you very well said i then you will consider that i am your patient everything is in confidence now professional confidence of course said doctor volney i got up from the couch some one had set a vase of white roses on the centre table a cluster of white roses freshly sprinkled and fragrant i threw them far out of the window and then laid myself upon the couch again it will be best bobby i said to have this cure happen suddenly i m rather tired of it all anyway you may go now and bring marian in but oh doc i

best of the lot san francisco frank norris east is east and west is san francisco according to californians californians are a race of people they are not merely inhabitants of a state they are the southerners of the west now chicagoans are no less loyal to their city but when you ask them why they stammer and speak of lake fish and the new odd fellows building but californians go into detail of course they have in the climate an argument that is good for half an hour while you are thinking of your coal bills and heavy underwear but as soon as they come to mistake your silence for conviction madness comes upon them and they picture the city of the golden gate as the bagdad of the new world so far as a matter of opinion no refutation is necessary but dear cousins all from adam and eve descended it is a rash one who will lay his finger on the map and say in this town there can be no romance what could happen here yes it is a bold and a rash deed to challenge in one sentence history romance and rand and mcnally nashville a city port of delivery and the capital of the state of tennessee is on the cumberland river and on the n c st l and the l n railroads this city is regarded as

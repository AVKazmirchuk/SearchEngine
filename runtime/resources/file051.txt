gazed intently through the prickly openings then he dismounted dropped the roan s reins and proceeded on foot stooping and silent like an indian the roan knowing his part stood still making no sound the kid crept noiselessly to the very edge of the pear thicket and reconnoitred between the leaves of a clump of cactus ten yards from his hiding place in the shade of the jacal sat his tonia calmly plaiting a rawhide lariat so far she might surely escape condemnation women have been known from time to time to engage in more mischievous occupations but if all must be told there is to be added that her head reposed against the broad and comfortable chest of a tall red and yellow man and that his arm was about her guiding her nimble fingers that required so many lessons at the intricate six strand plait sandridge glanced quickly at the dark mass of pear when he heard a slight squeaking sound that was not altogether unfamiliar a gun scabbard will make that sound when one grasps the handle of a six shooter suddenly but the sound was not repeated and tonia s fingers needed close attention and then in the shadow of death they began to talk of their love and in the still july afternoon every word they uttered reached the ears of the kid remember then said tonia you must not come again until i send for you soon he will be here a vaquero at the tienda said to day he saw him on the guadalupe three days ago when he is that near he always comes if he comes and finds you here he will kill you so for my sake you must come no more until i send you the word all right said the stranger and then what and then said the girl you must bring your men here and kill him if not he will kill you he ain t a man to surrender that s sure said sandridge it s kill or be killed for the officer that goes up against mr cisco kid he must die said the girl otherwise there will not be any peace in the world for thee and me he has killed many let him so die bring your men and give him no chance to escape you used to think right much of him said sandridge tonia dropped the lariat twisted herself around and curved a lemon tinted arm over the ranger s shoulder but then she murmured in liquid spanish i had not beheld thee thou great red mountain of a man and thou art kind and good as well as strong could one choose him knowing thee let him die for then i will not be filled with fear by day and night lest he hurt thee or me how can i know when he comes asked sandridge when he comes said tonia he remains two days sometimes three gregorio the small son of old luisa the lavendera has a swift pony i will write a letter to thee and send it by him saying how it will be best to come upon him by gregorio will the letter come and bring many men with thee and have much care oh dear red one for the rattlesnake is not quicker to strike than is el chivato as they call him to send a ball from his pistola the kid s handy with his gun sure enough admitted sandridge but when i come for him i shall come alone i ll get him by myself or not at all the cap wrote one or two things to me that make me want to do the trick without any help you let me know when mr kid arrives and i ll do the rest i will send you the message by the boy gregorio said the girl i knew you were braver than that small slayer of men who never smiles how could i ever have thought i cared for him it was time for the ranger to ride back to his camp on the water hole before he mounted his horse he raised the slight form of tonia with one arm high from the earth for a parting salute the drowsy stillness of the torpid summer air still lay thick upon the dreaming afternoon the smoke from the fire in the jacal where the frijoles blubbered in the iron pot rose straight as a plumb line above the clay daubed chimney no sound or movement disturbed the serenity of the dense pear thicket ten yards away when the form of sandridge had disappeared loping his big dun down the steep banks of the frio crossing the kid crept back to his own horse mounted him and rode back along the tortuous trail he had come but not far he stopped and waited in the silent depths of the pear until half an hour had passed and then tonia heard the high untrue notes of his unmusical singing coming nearer and nearer and she ran to the edge of the pear to meet him the kid seldom smiled but he smiled and waved his hat when he saw her he dismounted and his girl sprang into his arms the kid looked at her fondly his thick black hair clung to his head like a wrinkled mat the meeting brought a slight ripple of some undercurrent of feeling to his smooth dark face that was usually as motionless as a clay mask how s my girl he asked holding her close sick of waiting so long for you dear one she answered my eyes are dim with always gazing into that devil s pincushion through which you come and i can see into it such a little way too but you are here beloved one and i will not scold que mal muchacho not to come to see your alma more often go in and

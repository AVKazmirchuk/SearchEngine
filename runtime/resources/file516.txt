an hour i told you you never could i poked my straw anxiously in the cr me de menthe i m sure i beg your pardon i said a little uneasy at her gaze but that is just the trouble i have forgotten i ve forgotten everything she flouted my denial she laughed deliciously at something she seemed to see in my face i ve heard of you at times she went on you re quite a big lawyer out west denver isn t it or los angeles marian must be very proud of you you knew i suppose that i married six months after you did you may have seen it in the papers the flowers alone cost two thousand dollars she had mentioned fifteen years fifteen years is a long time would it be too late i asked somewhat timorously to offer you congratulations not if you dare do it she answered with such fine intrepidity that i was silent and began to crease patterns on the cloth with my thumb nail tell me one thing she said leaning toward me rather eagerly a thing i have wanted to know for many years just from a woman s curiosity of course have you ever dared since that night to touch smell or look at white roses at white roses wet with rain and dew i took a sip of cr me de menthe it would be useless i suppose i said with a sigh for me to repeat that i have no recollection at all about these things my memory is completely at fault i need not say how much i regret it the lady rested her arms upon the table and again her eyes disdained my words and went traveling by their own route direct to my soul she laughed softly with a strange quality in the sound it was a laugh of happiness yes and of content and of misery i tried to look away from her you lie elwyn bellford she breathed blissfully oh i know you lie i gazed dully into the ferns my name is edward pinkhammer i said i came with the delegates to the druggists national convention there is a movement on foot for arranging a new position for the bottles of tartrate of antimony and tartrate of potash in which very likely you would take little interest a shining landau stopped before the entrance the lady rose i took her hand and bowed i am deeply sorry i said to her that i cannot remember i could explain but fear you would not understand you will not concede pinkhammer and i really cannot at all conceive of the the roses and other things good by mr bellford she said with her happy sorrowful smile as she stepped into her carriage i attended the theatre that night when i returned to my hotel a quiet man in dark clothes who seemed interested in rubbing his finger nails with a silk handkerchief appeared magically at my side mr pinkhammer he said giving the bulk of his attention to his forefinger may i request you to step aside with me for a little conversation there is a room here certainly i answered he conducted me into a small private parlor a lady and a gentleman were there the lady i surmised would have been unusually good looking had her features not been clouded by an expression of keen worry and fatigue she was of a style of figure and possessed coloring and features that were agreeable to my fancy she was in a traveling dress she fixed upon me an earnest look of extreme anxiety and pressed an unsteady hand to her bosom i think she would have started forward but the gentleman arrested her movement with an authoritative motion of his hand he then came himself to meet me he was a man of forty a little gray about the temples and with a strong thoughtful face bellford old man he said cordially i m glad to see you again of course we know everything is all right i warned you you know that you were overdoing it now you ll go back with us and be yourself again in no time i smiled ironically i havae been bellforded so often i said that it has lost its edge still in the end it may grow wearisome would you be willing at all to entertain the hypothesis that my name is edward pinkhammer and that i never saw you before in my life before the man could reply a wailing cry came from the woman she sprang past his detaining arm elwyn she sobbed and cast herself upon me and clung tight elwyn she cried again don t break my heart i am your wife call my name once just once i could see you dead rather than this way i unwound her arms respectfully but firmly madam i said severely pardon me if i suggest that you accept a resemblance too precipitately it is a pity i went on with an amused laugh as the thought occurred to me that this bellford and i could not be kept side by side upon the same shelf like tartrates of sodium and antimony for purposes of identification in order to understand the allusion i concluded airily it may be necessary for you to keep an eye on the proceedings of the druggists national convention the lady turned to her companion and grasped his arm what is it doctor volney oh what is it she moaned go to your room for a while i heard him say i will remain and talk with him his mind no i think not only a portion of the brain yes i am sure he will recover go to your room and leave me with him the lady disappeared the man in dark clothes also went outside still manicuring himself in a thoughtful way i think he waited

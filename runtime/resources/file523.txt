as the outcome of an old palpitation of the heart impy fanned her as she lay on the sofa the doctor was due elsewhere and i followed him to the door i told him that it was within my power and intentions to make a reasonable advance of money to azalea adair on future contributions to the magazine and he seemed pleased by the way he said perhaps you would like to know that you have had royalty for a coachman old caesar s grandfather was a king in congo caesar himself has royal ways as you may have observed as the doctor was moving off i heard uncle caesar s voice inside did he get bofe of dem two dollars from you mis zalea yes caesar i heard azalea adair answer weakly and then i went in and concluded business negotiations with our contributor i assumed the responsibility of advancing fifty dollars putting it as a necessary formality in binding our bargain and then uncle caesar drove me back to the hotel here ends all of the story as far as i can testify as a witness the rest must be only bare statements of facts at about six o clock i went out for a stroll uncle caesar was at his corner he threw open the door of his carriage flourished his duster and began his depressing formula step right in suh fifty cents to anywhere in the city hack s puffickly clean suh jus got back from a funeral and then he recognized me i think his eyesight was getting bad his coat had taken on a few more faded shades of color the twine strings were more frayed and ragged the last remaining button the button of yellow horn was gone a motley descendant of kings was uncle caesar about two hours later i saw an excited crowd besieging the front of a drug store in a desert where nothing happens this was manna so i edged my way inside on an extemporized couch of empty boxes and chairs was stretched the mortal corporeality of major wentworth caswell a doctor was testing him for the immortal ingredient his decision was that it was conspicuous by its absence the erstwhile major had been found dead on a dark street and brought by curious and ennuied citizens to the drug store the late human being had been engaged in terrific battle the details showed that loafer and reprobate though he had been he had been also a warrior but he had lost his hands were yet clinched so tightly that his fingers would not be opened the gentle citizens who had know him stood about and searched their vocabularies to find some good words if it were possible to speak of him one kind looking man said after much thought when cas was about fo teen he was one of the best spellers in school while i stood there the fingers of the right hand of the man that was which hung down the side of a white pine box relaxed and dropped something at my feet i covered it with one foot quietly and a little later on i picked it up and pocketed it i reasoned that in his last struggle his hand must have seized that object unwittingly and held it in a death grip at the hotel that night the main topic of conversation with the possible exceptions of politics and prohibition was the demise of major caswell i heard one man say to a group of listeners in my opinion gentlemen caswell was murdered by somme of these no account niggers for his money he had fifty dollars this afternoon which he showed to several gentlemen in the hotel when he was found the money was not on his person i left the city the next morning at nine and as the train was crossing the bridge over the cumberland river i took out of my pocket a yellow horn overcoat button the size of a fifty cent piece with frayed ends of coarse twine hanging from it and cast it out of the window into the slow muddy waters below i wonder what s doing in buffalo psyche and the pskyscraper if you are a philosopher you can do this thing you can go to the top of a high building look down upon your fellow men feet below and despise them as insects like the irresponsible black waterbugs on summer ponds they crawl and circle and hustle about idiotically without aim or purpose they do not even move with the admirable intelligence of ants for ants always know when they are going home the ant is of a lowly station but he will often reach home and get his slippers on while you are left at your elevated station man then to the housetopped philosopher appears to be but a creeping contemptible beetle brokers poets millionaires bootblacks beauties hod carriers and politicians become little black specks dodging bigger black specks in streets no wider than your thumb from this high view the city itself becomes degraded to an unintelligible mass of distorted buildings and impossible perspectives the revered ocean is a duck pond the earth itself a lost golf ball all the minutiae of life are gone the philosopher gazes into the infinite heavens above him and allows his soul to expand to the influence of his new view he feels that he is the heir to eternity and the child of time space too should be his by the right of his immortal heritage and he thrills at the thought that some day his kind shall traverse theose mysterious aerial roads between planet and planet the tiny world beneath his feet upon which this towering structure of steel rests as a speck of dust upon a himalayan mountain it is but one of a countless number of such whirling atoms what are the ambitions the achievements the paltry conquests and

will lead the troops from here the new president will be senor espadas now minister of finance in the present cabinet what do you get i asked twill be strange said o connor smiling if i don t have all the jobs handed to me on a silver salver to pick what i choose i ve been the brains of the scheme and when the fighting opens i guess i won t be in the rear rank who managed it so our troops could get arms smuggled into this country didn t i arrange it with a new york firm before i left there our financial agents inform me that stands of winchester rifles have been delivered a month ago at a secret place up coast and distributed among the towns i tell you bowers the game is already won well that kind of talk kind of shook my disbelief in the infallibility of the serious irish gentleman soldier of fortune it certainly seemed that the patriotic grafters had gone about the thing in a business way i looked upon o connor with more respect and began to figure on what kind of uniform i might wear as secretary of war tuesday the day set for the revolution came around according to schedule o connor said that a signal had been agreed upon for the uprising there was an old cannon on the beach near the national warehouse that had been secretly loaded and promptly at twelve o clock was to be fired off immediately the revolutionists would seize their concealed arms attack the comandante s troops in the cuartel and capture the custom house and all government property and supplies i was nervous all the morning and about eleven o clock o connor became infused with the excitement and martial spirit of murder he geared his father s sword around him and walked up and down in the back room like a lion in the zoo suffering from corns i smoked a couple of dozen cigars and decided on yellow stripes down the trouser legs of my uniform at half past eleven o connor asks me to take a short stroll through the streets to see if i could notice any signs of the uprising i was back in fifteen minutes did you hear anything he asks i did says i at first i thought it was drums but it wasn t it was snoring everybody in town s asleep o connor tears out his watch fools says he they ve set the time right at the siesta hour when everybody takes a nap but the cannon will wake em up everything will be all right depend upon it just at twelve o clock we heard the sound of a cannon boom shaking the whole town o connor loosens his sword in its scabbard and jumps for the door i went as far as the door and stood in it people were sticking their heads out of doors and windows but there was one grand sight that made the landscape look tame general tumbalo the comandante was rolling down the steps of his residential dugout waving a five foot sabre in his hand he wore his cocked and plumed hat and his dress parade coat covered with gold braid and buttons sky blue pajamas one rubber boot and one red plush slipper completed his make up the general had heard the cannon and he puffed down the sidewalk toward the soldiers barracks as fast as his rudely awakened two hundred pounds could travel o connor sees him and lets out a battle cry and draws his father s sword and rushes across the street and tackle s the enemy right there in the street he and the general gave an exhibition of blacksmithing and butchery sparks flew from their blades the general roared and o connor gave the slogan of his race and proclivities then the general s sabre broke in two and he took to his ginger colored heels crying out policios at every jump o connor chased him a block imbued with the sentiment of manslaughter and slicing buttons off the general s coat tails with the paternal weapon at the corner five barefooted policemen in cotton undershirts and straw fiats climbed over o connor and subjugated him according to the municipal statutes they brought him past the late revolutionary headquarters on the way to jail i stood in the door a policeman had him by each hand and foot and they dragged him on his back through the grass like a turtle twice they stopped and the odd policeman took another s place while he rolled a cigarette the great soldier of fortune turned his head and looked at me as they passed i blushed and lit another cigar the procession passed on and at ten minutes past twelve everybody had gone back to sleep again in the afternoon the interpreter came around and smiled as he laid his hand on the big red jar we usually kept ice water in the ice man didn t call to day says i what s the matter with everything sancho ah yes says the liver colored linguist they just tell me in the town verree bad act that senor o connor make fight with general tumbalo yes general tumbalo great soldier and big mans what ll they do to mr o connor i asks i talk little

thousand he tapped his coat over the region of his chest exultantly gold mining stock he explained every cent of it shares par value one dollar bound to go up per cent within a year non assessable the blue gopher mine just discovered a month ago better get in yourself if you ve any spare dollars on hand sometimes said i these mines are not oh this one s solid as an old goose said jeff fifty thousand dollars worth of ore in sight and per cent monthly earnings guaranteed he drew out a long envelope from his pocket and cast it on the table always carry it with me said he so the burglar can

see that stock said jeff quickly almost snatching it from me to mitigate even though slightly the embarrassment i summoned the waiter and ordered another bottle of the barbera i thought it was the least i could do a tempered wind the first time my optical nerves was disturbed by the sight of buckingham skinner was in kansas city i was standing on a corner when i see buck stick his straw colored head out of a third story window of a business block and holler whoa there whoa like you would in endeavoring to assuage a team of runaway mules i looked around but all the animals i see in sight is a policeman having his shoes shined and a couple of delivery wagons hitched to posts then in a minute downstairs tumbles this buckingham skinner and runs to the corner and stands and gazes down the other street at the imaginary dust kicked up by the fabulous hoofs of the fictitious team of chimerical quadrupeds and then b skinner goes back up to the third story room again and i see that the lettering on the window is the farmers friend loan company by and by straw top comes down again and i crossed the street to meet him for i had my ideas yes sir when i got close i could see where he overdone it he was reub all right as far as his blue jeans and cowhide boots went but he had a matinee actor s hands and the rye straw stuck over his ear looked like it belonged to the property man of the old homestead co curiosity to know what his graft was got the best of me was that your team broke away and run just now i asks him polite i tried to stop em says i but i couldn t i guess they re half way back to the farm by now gosh blame them darned mules says straw top in a voice so good that i nearly apologized they re a lus bustin loose and then he looks at me close and then he takes off his hayseed hat and says in a different voice i d like to shake hands with parleyvoo pickens the greatest street man in the west barring only montague silver which you can no more than allow i let him shake hands with me i learned under silver i said i don t begrudge him the lead but what s your graft son i admit that the phantom flight of the non existing animals at which you remarked whoa has puzzled me somewhat how do you win out on the trick buckingham skinner blushed pocket money says he that s all i am temporarily unfinanced this little coup de rye straw is good for forty dollars in a town of this size how do i work it why i involve myself as you perceive in the loathsome apparel of the rural dub thus embalmed i am jonas stubblefield a name impossible to improve upon i repair

education in europe loans like that always suit the loan companies it s ten to one that when the note falls due the foreclosure will be leading the semiquavers by a couple of lengths well sir i reach in my pocket for the abstract of title but i suddenly hear my team running away i run to the window and emit the word or exclamation which ever it may be viz whoa then i rush down stairs and down the street returning in a few minutes dang them mules i says they done run away and busted the doubletree and two traces now i got to hoof it home for i never brought no money along reckon we ll talk about that loan some other time gen lemen then i spreads out my tarpaulin like the israelites and waits for the manna to drop why no mr stubblefield says the lobster colored party in the specs and

careful knot of morley s tie there s the buyers from the dry goods stores in the south during august and honeymooners from staten island and wrong said morley chuckling happily the answer is just men women and children the world well say new york and as far as summer boarders can swim out from long island is full of greenhorns two minutes longer on the broiler would have made this steak fit to be eaten by a gentleman francois if yez t inks it s on de bum said the waiter oi ll morley lifted his hand in protest slightly martyred protest it will do he said magnanimously and now green chartreuse frappe and a demi tasse morley went out leisurely and stood on a corner where two tradeful arteries of the city cross with a solitary dime in his pocket he stood on the curb watching with confident cynical smiling eyes the tides of people that flowed past him into that stream he must cast his net and draw fish for his further sustenance and need good izaak walton had not the half of his self reliance and bait lore a joyful party of four two women and two men fell upon him with cries of delight there was a dinner party on where had he been for a fortnight past what luck to thus run upon him they surrounded and engulfed him he must join them tra la la and the rest one with a white hat plume curving to the shoulder touched his sleeve and cast at the others a triumphant look that said see what i can do with him and added her queen s command to the invitations i leave you to imagine said morley pathetically how it desolates me to forego the pleasure but my friend carruthers of the new york yacht club is to pick me up here in his motor car at the white plume tossed and the quartet danced like midges around an arc light down the frolicsome way morley stood turning over and over the dime in his pocket and laughing gleefully to himself front he chanted under his breath front does it it is trumps in the game how they take it in men women and children forgeries water and salt lies how they all take it in an old man with an ill fitting suit a straggling gray beard and a corpulent umbrella hopped from the conglomeration of cabs and street cars to the sidewalk at morley s side stranger said he excuse me for troubling you but do you know anybody in this here town named solomon smothers he s my son and i ve come down from ellenville to visit him be darned if i know what i done with his street and number i do not sir said morley half closing his eyes to veil the joy in them you had better apply to the police the police said the old man i ain t done nothin to call in the police about i just come down to see ben he lives in a five story house he writes me if you know anybody by that name and could i told you i did not said morley coldly i know no one by the name of smithers and i advise you to smothers not smithers interrupted the old man hopefully a heavy sot man sandy complected about twenty nine two front teeth out about five foot oh smothers exclaimed morley

ninety eight cent one that the railroads according to these watchmakers are run by the bishop of long island said morley was to meet me here at to dine with me at the kingfishers club but i can t leave the father of my friend sol smothers alone on the street by st swithin mr smothers we wall street men have to work tired is no name for it i was about to step across to the other corner and have a glass of ginger ale with a dash of sherry when you approached me you must let me take you to sol s house mr smothers but before we take the car i hope you will join me in an hour later morley seated himself on the end of a quiet bench in madison square with a twenty five cent cigar between his lips and in deeply creased bills in his inside pocket content light hearted ironical keenly philosophic he watched the moon drifting in and out amidst a maze of flying clouds an old ragged man with a low bowed head sat at the other end of the bench presently the old man stirred and looked at his bench companion in morley s appearance he seemed to recognize something superior to the usual nightly occupants of the benches kind sir he whined if you could spare a dime or even a few pennies to one who morley cut short his stereotyped appeal by throwing him a dollar god bless you said the old man i ve been trying to find work for work echoed morley with his ringing laugh you are a fool my friend the

for big jim dougherty the habitat of the sport is the lobby or the outside corner of certain hotels and combination restaurants and cafes they are mostly men of different sizes running from small to large but they are unanimous in the possession of a recently shaven blue black cheek and chin and dark overcoats in season with black velvet collars of the domestic life of the sport little is known it has been said that cupid and hymen sometimes take a band in the game and copper the queen of hearts to lose daring theorists have averred not content with simply saying that a sport often contracts a spouse and even incurs descendants sometimes he sits in the game of politics and then at chowder picnics there is a revelation of a mrs sport and little sports in glazed hats with tin pails but mostly the sport is oriental he believes his women folk should not be too patent somewhere be bind grilles or flower ornamented fire escapes they await him there no doubt they tread on rugs from teheran and are diverted by the bulbul and play upon the dulcimer and feed upon sweetmeats but away from his home the sport is an integer he does not as men of other races in manhattan do become the convoy in his unoccupied hours of fluttering laces and high heels that tick off delectably the happy seconds of the evening parade he herds with his own race at corners and delivers a commentary in his carib lingo upon the passing show big jim dougherty had a wife but be did not wear a button portrait of her upon his lapel he bad a home in one of those brown stone iron railed streets on the west side that look like a recently ex cavated bowling alley of pompeii to this home of his mr dougherty repaired each night when the hour was so late as to promise no further diversion in the arch domains of sport by that time the occupant of the monogamistic harem would be in dreamland the bulbul silenced and the hour propitious for slumber big jim always arose at twelve meridian for breakfast and soon afterward he would return to the rendezvous of his crowd he was always vaguely conscious that there was a mrs dougherty he would have received without denial the charge that the quiet neat comfortable little woman across the table at home was his wife in fact he remembered pretty well that they bad been married for nearly four years she would often tell him about the cute tricks of spot the canary and the light haired lady that lived in the window of the flat across the street big jim dougherty even listened to this con versation of hers sometimes he knew that she would have a nice dinner ready for him every evening at seven when he came for it she sometimes went to matinees and she bad a talking machine with six dozen records once when her uncle amos blew in on a wind from up state she went with him to the eden musee surely these things were diversions enough for any woman one afternoon mr dougherty finished his break fast put on his bat and got away fairly for the door when his hand was on the knob be heard his wife s voice jim she said firmly i wish you would take me out to dinner this evening it has been three years since you have been outside the door with me big jim was astounded she bad never asked anything like this before it had the flavor of a totally new proposition but he was a game sport all right be said you be ready when i come at seven none of this wait two minutes till i primp an hour or two kind of business now dele i ll be ready said his wife calmly at seven she descended the stone steps in the pom peian bowling alley at the side of big jim dough erty she wore a dinner gown made of a stuff that the spiders must have woven and of a color that a twilight sky must have contributed a light coat with many admirably unnecessary capes and adorably inutile ribbons floated downward from her shoulders fine feathers do make fine birds and the only re proach in the saying is for the man who refuses to give up his earnings to the ostrich tip industry big jim dougherty was troubled there was a being at his side whom be did not know he thought of the sober hued plumage that this bird of paradise was accustomed to wear in her cage and this winged revelation puzzled him in some way she reminded him of the delia cullen that be had married four years before shyly and rather awkwardly he stalked at her right band after dinner i ll take you back home dele said mr dougherty and then i ll drop back up to selt zer s with the boys you can have swell chuck to night if you want it i made a winning on anaconda yesterday so you can go as far as you like mr dougherty had intended to make the outing with his unwonted wife an inconspicuous one uxori ousness was a weakness that the precepts of the caribs did not countenance if any of his friends of the track the billiard cloth or the square circle had wives they had never complained of the fact in public there were a number of table d hote places on the cross streets near the broad and

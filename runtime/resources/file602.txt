endeavours to be polite and help the ladies out the camp demanded the particulars i was manager of the triangle b ranch in the panhandle said bud it was owned at that time by old man sterling of new york he wanted to sell out and he wrote for me to come on to new york and explain the ranch to the syndicate that wanted to buy so i sends to fort worth and has a forty dollar suit of clothes made and hits the trail for the big village well when i got there old man sterling and his outfit certainly laid themselves out to be agreeable we had business and pleasure so mixed up that you couldn t tell whether it was a treat or a trade half the time we had trolley rides and cigars and theatre round ups and rubber parties rubber parties said a listener inquiringly sure said bud didn t you never attend em you walk around and try to look at the tops of the skyscrapers well we sold the ranch and old man sterling asks me round to his house to take grub on the night before i started back it wasn t any high collared affair just me and the old man and his wife and daughter but they was a fine haired outfit all right and the lilies of the field wasn t in it they made my fort worth clothes carpenter look like a dealer in horse blankets and gee strings and then the table was all pompous with flowers and there was a whole kit of tools laid out beside everybody s plate you d have thought you was fixed out to burglarize a restaurant before you could get your grub but i d been in new york over a week then and i was getting on to stylish ways i kind of trailed behind and watched the others use the hardware supplies and then i tackled the chuck with the same weapons it ain t much trouble to travel with the high flyers after you find out their gait i got along fine i was feeling cool and agreeable and pretty soon i was talking away fluent as you please all about the ranch and the west and telling em how the indians eat grasshopper stew and snakes and you never saw people so interested but the real joy of that feast was that miss sterling just a little trick she was not bigger than two bits worth of chewing plug but she had a way about her that seemed to say she was the people and you believed it and yet she never put on any airs and she smiled at me the same as if i was a millionaire while i was telling about a creek dog feast and listened like it was news from home by and by after we had eat oysters and some watery soup and truck that never was in my repertory a methodist preacher brings in a kind of camp stove arrangement all silver on long legs with a lamp under it miss sterling lights up and begins to do some cooking right on the supper table i wondered why old man sterling didn t hire a cook with all the money he had pretty soon she dished out some cheesy tasting truck that she said was rabbit but i swear there had never been a molly cotton tail in a mile of it the last thing on the programme was lemonade it was brought around in little flat glass bowls and set by your plate i was pretty thirsty and i picked up mine and took a big swig of it right there was where the little lady had made a mistake she had put in the lemon all right but she d forgot the sugar the best housekeepers slip up sometimes i thought maybe miss sterling was just learning to keep house and cook that rabbit would surely make you think so and i says to myself little lady sugar or no sugar i ll stand by you and i raises up my bowl again and drinks the last drop of the lemonade and then all the balance of em picks up their bowls and does the same and then i gives miss sterling the laugh proper just to carry it off like a joke so she wouldn t feel bad about the mistake after we all went into the sitting room she sat down and talked to me quite awhile it was so kind of you mr kingsbury says she to bring my blunder off so nicely it was so stupid of me to forget the sugar never you mind says i some lucky man will throw his rope over a mighty elegant little housekeeper some day not far from here if you mean me mr kingsbury says she laughing out loud i hope he will be as lenient with my poor housekeeping as you have been don t mention it says i anything to oblige the ladies bud ceased his reminiscences and then some one asked him what he considered the most striking and prominent trait of new yorkers the most visible and peculiar trait of new york folks answered bud is new york most of em has new york on the brain they have heard of other places such as waco and paris and hot springs and london but they don t believe in em they think that town is all merino now to show you how much they care for their village i ll tell you about one of em that strayed out as far as the triangle b while i was working there this new yorker come out there looking for a job on the ranch he said he was a good horseback rider and there was pieces of tanbark hanging on his clothes yet from his riding school well for a while

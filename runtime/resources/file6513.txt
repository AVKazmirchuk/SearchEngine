crying for it s a custom of the sex to cry when they have sorrow to weep when they have joy and to shed tears whenever they find themselves without either the old women s fingers shake when they stuff the skads in the bosom of their rusty dresses the factory girls just stoop over and flap their dry goods a second and you hear the elastic go pop as the currency goes down in the ladies department of the old domestic lisle thread bank some of the stockholders that had been doing the jeremiah act the loudest outside had spasms of restored confidence and wanted to leave the money invested salt away that chicken feed in your duds and skip along says buck what business have you got investing in bonds the tea pot or the crack in the wall behind the clock for your hoard of pennies when the pretty girl in the red shawl cashes in buck hands her an extra twenty a wedding present says our treasurer from the golconda company and say if jakey ever follows his nose even at a respectful distance around the corner where rosa steinfeld lives you are hereby authorized to knock a couple of inches of it off when they was all paid off and gone buck calls the newspaper reporter and shoves the rest of the money over to him you begun this says buck now finish it over there are the books showing every share and bond issued here s the money to cover except what we ve spent to live on you ll have to

scheme excuse me gang giving back the boodle oh no i m not on the comic supplement you can t understand it of course says buck with his hand on the door knob me and pick ain t wall streeters like you know em we never allowed to swindle sick old women and working girls and take nickels off of kids in the lines of graft we ve worked we took money from the people the lord made to be buncoed sports and rounders and smart alecks and street crowds that always have a few dollars to throw away and farmers that wouldn t ever be happy if the grafters didn t come around and play with em when they sold their crops we never cared to fish for the kind of suckers that bite here no sir we got too much respect for the profession and for ourselves good by to you mr receiver here says the journalist reporter wait a minute there s a broker i know on the next floor wait till i put this truck in his safe i want you fellows to take a drink on me before you go on you says buck winking solemn don t you go and try to make em believe at the office you said that thanks we can t spare the time i reckon so long and me and buck slides out the door and that s the way the golconda company went into involuntary liquefaction if you had seen me and buck the next night you d have had to go to a little bum hotel over near the west side ferry landings we was in a little back room and i was filling up a gross of six ounce bottles with hydrant water colored red with aniline and flavored with cinnamon buck was smoking contented and he wore a decent brown derby in place of his silk hat it s a good thing pick says he as he drove in the corks that we got brady to lend us his horse and wagon for a week we ll rustle up the stake by then this hair tonic ll sell right along over in jersey bald heads ain t popular over there on account of the mosquitoes directly i dragged out my valise and went down in it for labels hair tonic labels are out says i only about a dozen on hand buy some more says buck we investigated our pockets and found we had just enough money to settle our hotel bill in the morning and pay our passage over the ferry plenty of the shake the shakes chill cure labels says i after looking what more do you want says buck slap em on the chill season is just opening up in the hackensack low grounds what s hair anyway if you have to shake it off we pasted on the chill cure labels about half an hour and buck says making an honest livin s better than that wall street anyhow ain t it pick you bet says i hostages to momus i i never got inside of the legitimate line of graft but once but one time as i say i reversed the decision of the revised statutes and undertook a thing that i d have to apologize for even under the new jersey trust laws me and caligula polk of muskogee in the creek nation was down in the mexican state of tamaulipas running a peripatetic lottery and monte game now selling lottery tickets is a government graft in mexico just like selling forty eight cents worth of postage stamps for forty nine cents is over here so uncle porfirio he instructs the rurales to attend to our case rurales they re a sort of country police but don t draw any mental crayon portraits of the worthy constables with a tin star and a gray goatee the rurales well if we d mount our supreme court on broncos arm em with winchesters and start em out after john doe et al we d have about the same thing when the rurales started for us we started for the states they chased us as far as matamoras we hid in a brickyard and that night we swum the rio grande caligula with a brick in each hand absent minded which he drops upon the soil of texas forgetting he had em from there we emigrated to san antone and then over to new orleans where we took a rest and in that town of cotton bales and other adjuncts to female beauty we made the acquaintance of drinks invented by the creoles during the period of louey cans in which they are still served at the side doors the most i can remember of this town is that me and caligula and a frenchman named mccarty wait a minute adolph mccarty was trying to make the french quarter pay up the back trading stamps due on the louisiana purchase when somebody hollers that the johndarms are coming i have an insufficient recollection of buying two yellow tickets through a window and i seemed to see a man swing a lantern and say all aboard i remembered no more except that the train butcher was covering me and caligula up with augusta j evans s works and figs when we become revised we find that we have collided up against the state of georgia at a spot hitherto unaccounted for in time tables except by an asterisk which means that trains stop every other thursday on signal by tearing up a rail we was waked up in a yellow pine hotel by the noise of flowers and the smell of birds yes sir for the wind was banging sunflowers as big as buggy wheels against the weatherboarding and the chicken coop was right under the window me and caligula dressed and went down stairs the landlord was shelling peas on the front porch he was six feet of chills and fever and hongkong in complexion though in other respects he seemed amenable in the exercise of his sentiments and features caligula who is a spokesman by birth and a small man though red haired and impatient of painfulness of any kind speaks up pardner says he good morning and be darned to you would you mind telling us why we are at we know the reason we are where but can t exactly figure out on account of at what place well gentlemen says the landlord i reckoned you all would be inquiring this morning you all dropped off of the nine thirty train here last night and you was right tight yes you was right smart in liquor i can inform you that you are now in the town of mountain valley in the state of georgia on top of that says caligula don t say that we can t have anything to eat sit down gentlemen says the landlord and in twenty minutes i ll call you to the best breakfast you can get anywhere in town that breakfast turned out to be composed of fried bacon and a yellowish edifice that proved up something between pound cake and flexible sandstone the landlord calls it corn pone and then he sets out a dish of the exaggerated breakfast food known as hominy and so me and caligula makes the acquaintance of the celebrated food that enabled every johnny reb to lick one and two thirds yankees for nearly four years at a stretch the wonder to me is says caligula that uncle robert lee s boys didn t chase the grant and sherman outfit clear up into hudson s bay it would have made me that mad to eat this truck they call mahogany hog and hominy i explains is the staple food of this section then says caligula they ought to keep it where it belongs i thought this was a hotel and not a stable now if we was in muskogee at the st lucifer house i d show you some breakfast grub antelope steaks and fried liver to begin on and venison cutlets with chili con carne and pineapple fritters and then some sardines and mixed pickles and top it off with a can of yellow clings and a bottle of beer you won t find a layout like that on the bill of affairs of any of your eastern restauraws too lavish says i i ve traveled and i m unprejudiced there ll never be a perfect breakfast eaten until some man grows arms long enough to stretch down to new orleans for his coffee and over to norfolk for his rolls and reaches up to vermont and digs a slice of butter out of a spring house and then turns over a beehive close to a white clover patch out in indiana for the rest then he d come pretty close to making a meal on the amber that the gods eat on mount olympia too ephemeral says caligula i d want ham and eggs or rabbit stew anyhow for a chaser what do you consider the most edifying and casual in the way of a dinner i ve been infatuated from time to time i answers with fancy ramifications of grub such as terrapins lobsters reed birds jambolaya and canvas covered ducks but after all there s nothing less displeasing to me than a beefsteak smothered in mushrooms on a balcony in sound of the broadway streetcars with a hand organ playing down below and the boys hollering extras about the latest suicide for the wine give me a reasonable ponty cany and that s all except a demi tasse well says caligula i reckon in new york you get to be a conniseer and when you go around with the demi tasse you are naturally bound to buy em stylish grub it s a great town for epicures says i you d soon fall into their ways if you was there i ve heard it was says caligula but i reckon i wouldn t i can polish my fingernails all they need myself ii after breakfast we went out on the front porch lighted up two of the landlord s flor de upas perfectos and took a look at georgia the installment of scenery visible to the eye looked mighty poor as far as we could see was red hills all washed down with gullies and scattered over with patches of piny woods blackberry bushes was all that kept the rail fences from falling down about fifteen miles over to the north was a little range of well timbered mountains that town of mountain valley wasn t going about a dozen people permeated along the sidewalks but what you saw mostly was rain barrels and roosters and boys poking around with sticks in piles of ashes made by burning the scenery of uncle tom shows and just then there passes down on the other side of the street a high man in a long black coat and a beaver hat all the people in sight bowed and some crossed the street to shake hands with him folks came out of stores and houses to holler at him women leaned out of windows and smiled and all the kids stopped playing to look at him our landlord stepped out on the porch and bent himself double like a carpenter s rule and sung out good morning colonel when he was a dozen yards gone by and is that alexander pa says caligula to the landlord and why is he called great that gentlemen says the landlord is no less than colonel jackson t rockingham the president of the sunrise edenville tap railroad mayor of mountain valley and chairman of the perry county board of immigration and public improvements been away a good many years hasn t he i asked no sir colonel rockingham is going down to the post office for his mail his fellow citizens take pleasure in greeting him thus every morning the colonel is our most prominent citizen besides the height of the stock of the sunrise edenville tap railroad he owns a thousand acres of that land across the creek mountain valley delights sir to honor a citizen of such worth and public spirit for an hour that afternoon caligula sat on the back of his neck on the porch and studied a newspaper which was unusual in a man who despised print when he was through he took me to the end of the porch among the sunlight and drying dish towels i knew that caligula had invented a new graft for he chewed the ends of his mustache and ran the left catch of his suspenders up and down which was his way what is it now i asks just so it ain t floating mining stocks or raising pennsylvania pinks we ll talk it over pennsylvania pinks oh that refers to a coin raising scheme of the keystoners they burn the soles of old women s feet to make them tell where their money s hid caligula s words in business was always few and bitter you see them mountains said he pointing and you seen that colonel man that owns railroads and cuts more ice when he goes to the post office than roosevelt does when he cleans em out what we re going to do is to kidnap the latter into the former and inflict a ransom of ten thousand dollars illegality says i shaking my head i knew you d say that says caligula at first sight it does seem to jar peace and dignity but it don t i got the idea out of that newspaper would you commit aspersions on a equitable graft that the united states itself has condoned and indorsed and ratified kidnapping says i is an immoral function in the derogatory list of the statutes if the united states upholds it it must be a recent enactment of ethics along with race suicide and rural delivery listen says caligula and i ll explain the case set down in the papers here was a greek citizen named burdick harris says he captured for a graft by africans and the united states sends two gunboats to the state of tangiers and makes the king of morocco give up seventy thousand dollars to raisuli go slow says i that sounds too international to take in all at once it s like thimble thimble who s got the naturalization papers twas press despatches from constantinople says caligula you ll see six months from now they ll be confirmed by the monthly magazines and then it won t be long till you ll notice em alongside the photos of the mount pelee eruption photos in the while you get your hair cut weeklies it s all right pick this african man raisuli hides burdick harris up in the mountains and advertises his price to the governments of different nations now you wouldn t think for a minute goes on caligula that john hay would have chipped in and helped this graft along if it wasn t a square game would you why no says i i ve always stood right in with bryan s policies and i couldn t consciously say a word against the republican administration just now but if harris was a greek on what system of international protocols did hay interfere it ain t exactly set forth in the papers says caligula i suppose it s a matter of sentiment you know he wrote this poem little breeches and them greeks wear little or none but anyhow john hay sends the brooklyn and the olympia over and they cover africa with thirty inch guns and then hay cables after the health of the persona grata and how are they this morning he wires is burdick harris alive yet or mr raisuli dead and the king of morocco sends up the seventy thousand dollars and they turn burdick harris loose and there s not half the hard feelings among the nations about this little kidnapping matter as there was about the peace congress and burdick harris says to the reporters in the greek language that he s often heard about the united states and he admires roosevelt next to raisuli who is one of the whitest and most gentlemanly kidnappers that he ever worked alongside of so you see pick winds up caligula we ve got the law of nations on our side we ll cut this colonel man out of the herd and corral him in them little mountains and stick up his heirs and assigns for ten thousand dollars well you seldom little red headed territorial terror i answers you can t bluff your uncle tecumseh pickens i ll be your company in this graft but i misdoubt if you ve absorbed the inwardness of this burdick harris case calig and if on any morning we get a telegram from the secretary of state asking about the health of the scheme i propose to acquire the most propinquitous and celeritous mule in this section and gallop diplomatically over into the neighboring and peaceful nation of alabama iii me and caligula spent the next three days investigating the bunch of mountains into which we proposed to kidnap colonel jackson t rockingham we finally selected an upright slice of topography covered with bushes and trees that you could only reach by a secret path that we cut out up the side of it and the only way to reach the mountain was to follow up the bend of a branch that wound among the elevations then i took in hand an important subdivision of the proceedings i went up to atlanta on the train and laid in a two hundred and fifty dollar supply of the most gratifying and efficient lines of grub that money could buy i always was an admirer of viands in their more palliative and revised stages hog and hominy are not only inartistic to my stomach but they give indigestion to my moral sentiments and i thought of colonel jackson t rockingham president of the sunrise edenville tap railroad and how he would miss the luxury of his home fare as is so famous among wealthy southerners so i sunk half of mine and caligula s capital in as elegant a layout of fresh and canned provisions as burdick harris or any other professional kidnappee ever saw in a camp i put another hundred in a couple of cases of bordeaux two quarts of cognac two hundred havana regalias with gold bands and a camp stove and stools and folding cots i wanted colonel rockingham to be comfortable and i hoped after he gave up the ten thousand dollars he would give me and caligula as good a name for gentlemen and entertainers as the greek man did the friend of his that made the united states his bill collector against africa when the goods came down from atlanta we hired a wagon moved them up on the little mountain and established camp and then we laid for the colonel we caught him one morning about two miles out from mountain valley on his way to look after some of his burnt umber farm land he was an elegant old gentleman as thin and tall as a trout rod with frazzled shirt cuffs and specs on a black string we explained to him brief and easy what we wanted and caligula showed him careless the handle of his forty five under his coat what says colonel rockingham bandits in perry county georgia i shall see that the board of immigration and public improvements hears of this be so unfoolhardy as to climb into that buggy says caligula by order of the board of perforation and public depravity this is a business meeting and we re anxious to adjourn sine qua non we drove colonel rockingham over the mountain and up the side of it as far as the buggy could go then we tied the horse and took our prisoner on foot up to the camp now colonel i says to him we re after the ransom me and my partner and no harm will come to you if the king of mor if your friends send up the dust in the mean time we are gentlemen the same as you and if you give us your word not to try to escape the freedom of the camp is yours i give you my word says the colonel all right says i and now it s eleven o clock and me and mr polk will proceed to inculcate the occasion with a few well timed trivialities in the way of grub thank you says the colonel i believe i could relish a slice of bacon and a plate of hominy but you won t says i emphatic not in this camp we soar in higher regions than them occupied by your celebrated but repulsive dish while the colonel read his paper me and caligula took off our coats and went in for a little luncheon de luxe just to show him caligula was a fine cook of the western brand he could toast a buffalo or fricassee a couple of steers as easy as a woman could make a cup of tea he was gifted in the way of knocking together edibles when haste and muscle and quantity was to be considered he held the record west of the arkansas river for frying pancakes with his left hand broiling venison cutlets with his right and skinning a rabbit with his teeth at the same time but i could do things en casserole and la creole and handle the oil and tobasco as gently and nicely as a french chef so at twelve o clock we had a hot lunch ready that looked like a banquet on a mississippi river steamboat we spread it on the tops of two or three big boxes opened two quarts of the red wine set the olives and a canned oyster cocktail and a ready made martini by the colonel s plate and called him to grub colonel rockingham drew up his campstool wiped off his specs and looked at the things on the table then i thought he was swearing and i felt mean because i hadn t taken more pains with the victuals but he wasn t he was asking a blessing and me and caligula hung our heads and i saw a tear drop from the colonel s eye into his cocktail i never saw a man eat with so much earnestness and application not hastily like a grammarian or one of the canal but slow and appreciative like a anaconda or a real vive bonjour in an hour and a half the colonel leaned back i brought him a pony of brandy and his black coffee and set the box of havana regalias on the table gentlemen says he blowing out the smoke and trying to breathe it back again when we view the eternal hills and the smiling and beneficent landscape and reflect upon the goodness of the creator who excuse me colonel says i but there s some business to attend to now and i brought out paper and pen and ink and laid em before him who do you want to send to for the money i asks i reckon says he after thinking a bit to the vice president of our railroad at the general offices of the company in edenville how far is it to edenville from here i asked about ten miles says he then i dictated these lines and colonel rockingham wrote them out i am kidnapped and held a prisoner by two desperate outlaws in a place which is useless to attempt to find they demand ten thousand dollars at once for my release the amount must be raised immediately and these directions followed come alone with the money to stony creek which runs out of blacktop mountains follow the bed of the creek till you come to a big flat rock on the left bank on which is marked a cross in red chalk stand on the rock and wave a white flag a guide will come to you and conduct you to where i am held lose no time after the colonel had finished this he asked permission to take on a postscript about how he was being treated so the railroad wouldn t feel uneasy in its bosom about him we agreed to that he wrote down that he had just had lunch with the two desperate ruffians and then he set down the whole bill of fare from cocktails to coffee he wound up with the remark that dinner would be ready about six and would probably be a more licentious and intemperate affair than lunch me and caligula read it and decided to let it go for we being cooks were amenable to praise though it sounded out of place on a sight draft for ten thousand dollars i took the letter over to the mountain valley road and watched for a messenger by and by a colored equestrian came along on horseback riding toward edenville i gave him a dollar to take the letter to the railroad offices and then i went back to camp iv about four o clock in the afternoon caligula who was acting as lookout calls to me i have to report a white shirt signalling on the starboard bow sir i went down the mountain and brought back a fat red man in an alpaca coat and no collar gentlemen says colonel rockingham allow me to introduce my brother captain duval c rockingham vice president of the sunrise edenville tap railroad otherwise the king of morocco says i i reckon you don t mind my counting the ransom just as a business formality well no not exactly says the fat man not when it comes i turned that matter over to our second vice president i was anxious after brother jackson s safetiness i reckon he ll be along right soon what does that lobster salad you mentioned taste like brother jackson mr vice president says i you ll oblige us by remaining here till the second v p arrives this is a private rehearsal and we don t want any roadside speculators selling tickets in half an hour caligula sings out again sail ho looks like an apron on a broomstick i perambulated down the cliff again and escorted up a man six foot three with a sandy beard and no other dimension that you could notice thinks i to myself if he s got ten thousand dollars on his person it s in one bill and folded lengthwise mr patterson g coble our second vice president announces the colonel glad to know you gentlemen says this coble i came up to disseminate the tidings that major tallahassee tucker our general passenger agent is now negotiating a peachcrate full of our railroad bonds with the perry county bank for a loan my dear colonel rockingham was that chicken gumbo or cracked goobers on the bill of fare in your note me and the conductor of fifty six was having a dispute about it another white wings on the rocks hollers caligula if i see any more i ll fire on em and swear they was torpedo boats the guide goes down again and convoys into the lair a person in blue overalls carrying an amount of inebriety and a lantern i am so sure that this is major tucker that i don t even ask him until we are up above and then i discover that it is uncle timothy the yard switchman at edenville who is sent ahead to flag our understandings with the gossip that judge pendergast the railroad s attorney is in the process of mortgaging colonel rockingham s farming lands to make up the ransom while he is talking two men crawl from under the bushes into camp and caligula with no white flag to disinter him from his plain duty draws his gun but again colonel rockingham intervenes and introduces mr jones and mr batts engineer and fireman of train number forty two excuse us says batts but me and jim have hunted squirrels all over this mounting and we don t need no white flag was that straight colonel about the plum pudding and pineapples and real store cigars towel on a fishing pole in the offing howls caligula suppose it s the firing line of the freight conductors and brakeman my last trip down says i wiping off my face if the s e t wants to run an excursion up here just because we kidnapped their president let em we ll put out our sign the kidnapper s cafe and trainmen s home this time i caught major tallahassee tucker by his own confession and i felt easier i asked him into the creek so i could drown him if he happened to be a track walker or caboose porter all the way up the mountain he driveled to me about asparagus on toast a thing that his intelligence in life had skipped up above i got his mind segregated from food and asked if he had raised the ransom my dear sir says he i succeeded in negotiating a loan on thirty thousand dollars worth of the bonds of our railroad and never mind just now major says i it s all right then wait till after dinner and we ll settle the business all of you gentlemen i continues to the crowd are invited to stay to dinner we have mutually trusted one another and the white flag is supposed to wave over the proceedings the correct idea says caligula who was standing by me two baggage masters and a ticket agent dropped out of a tree while you was below the last time did the major man bring the money he says i answered that he succeeded in negotiating the loan if any cooks ever earned ten thousand dollars in twelve hours me and caligula did that day at six o clock we spread the top of the mountain with as fine a dinner as the personnel of any railroad ever engulfed we opened all the wine and we concocted entr es and pi ces de resistance and stirred up little savory chef de cuisines and organized a mass of grub such as has been seldom instigated out of canned and bottled goods the railroad gathered around it and the wassail and diversions was intense after the feast me and caligula in the line of business takes major tucker to one side and talks ransom the major pulls out an agglomeration of currency about the size of the price of a town lot in the suburbs of rabbitville arizona and makes this outcry gentlemen says he the stock of the sunrise edenville railroad has depreciated some the best i could do with thirty thousand dollars worth of the bonds was to secure a loan of eighty seven dollars and fifty cents on the farming lands of colonel rockingham judge pendergast was able to obtain on a ninth mortgage the sum of fifty dollars you will find the amount one hundred and thirty seven fifty correct a railroad president said i looking this tucker in the eye and the owner of a thousand acres of land and yet gentlemen says tucker the railroad is ten miles long there don t any train run on it except when the crew goes out in the pines and gathers enough lightwood knots to get up steam a long time ago when times was good the net earnings used to run as high as eighteen dollars a week colonel rockingham s land has been sold for taxes thirteen times there hasn t been a peach crop in this part of georgia for two years the wet spring killed the watermelons nobody around here has money enough to buy fertilizer and land is so poor the corn crop failed and there wasn t enough grass to support the rabbits all the people have had to eat in this section for over a year is hog and hominy and pick interrupts caligula mussing up his red hair what are you going to do with that chicken feed i hands the money back to major tucker and then i goes over to colonel rockingham and slaps him on the back colonel says i i hope you ve enjoyed our little joke we don t want to carry it too far kidnappers well wouldn t it tickle your uncle my name s rhinegelder and i m a nephew of chauncey depew my friend s a second cousin of the editor of puck so you can see we are down south enjoying ourselves in our humorous way now there s two quarts of cognac to open yet and then the joke s over what s the use to go into details one or two will be enough i remember major tallahassee tucker playing on a jew s harp and caligula waltzing with his head on the watch pocket of a tall baggage master i hesitate to refer to the cake walk done by me and mr patterson g coble with colonel jackson t rockingham between us and even on the next morning when you wouldn t think it possible there was a consolation for me and caligula we knew that raisuli himself never made half the hit with burdick harris that we did with the sunrise edenville tap railroad the ethics of pig on an east bound train i went into the smoker and found jefferson peters the only man with a brain west of the wabash river who can use his cerebrum cerebellum and medulla oblongata at the same time jeff is in the line of unillegal graft he is not to be dreaded by widows and orphans he is a reducer of surplusage his favorite disguise is that of the target bird at which the spendthrift or the reckless investor may shy a few inconsequential dollars he is readily vocalized by tobacco so with the aid of two thick and easy burning brevas i got the story of his latest autolycan adventure in my line of business said jeff the hardest thing is to find an upright trustworthy strictly honorable partner to work a graft with some of the best men i ever worked with in a swindle would resort to trickery at times so last summer i thinks i will go over into this section of country where i hear the serpent has not yet entered and see if i can find a partner naturally gifted with a talent for crime but not yet contaminated by success i found a village that seemed to show the right kind of a layout the inhabitants hadn t found that adam had been dispossessed and were going right along naming the animals and killing snakes just as if they were in the garden of eden they call this town mount nebo and it s up near the spot where kentucky and west virginia and north carolina corner together them states don t meet well it was in that neighborhood anyway after putting in a week proving i wasn t a revenue officer i went over to the store where the rude fourflushers of the hamlet lied to see if i could get a line on the kind of man i wanted gentlemen says i after we had rubbed noses and gathered round the dried apple barrel i don t suppose there s another community in the whole world into which sin and chicanery has less extensively permeated than this life here where all the women are brave and propitious and all the men honest and expedient must indeed be an idol it reminds me says i of goldstein s beautiful ballad entitled the deserted village which says ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey what art can drive its charms away the judge rode slowly down the lane mother for i m to be queen of the may why yes mr peters says the storekeeper i reckon we air about as moral and torpid a community as there be on the mounting according to censuses of opinion but i reckon you ain t ever met rufe tatum why no says the town constable he can t hardly have ever that air rufe is shore the monstrousest scalawag that has escaped hangin on the galluses and that puts me in mind that i ought to have turned rufe out of the lockup before yesterday the thirty days he got for killin yance goodloe was up then a day or two more won t hurt rufe any though shucks now says i in the mountain idiom don t tell me there s a man in mount nebo as bad as that worse says the storekeeper he steals hogs i think i will look up this mr tatum so a day or two after the constable turned him out i got acquainted with him and invited him out on the edge of town to sit on a log and talk business what i wanted was a partner with a natural rural make up to play a part in some little one act outrages that i was going to book with the pitfall gin circuit in some of the western towns and this r tatum was born for the role as sure as nature cast fairbanks for the stuff that kept eliza from sinking into the river he was about the size of a first baseman and he had ambiguous blue eyes like the china dog on the mantelpiece that aunt harriet used to play with when she was a child his hair waved a little bit like the statue of the dinkus thrower at the vacation in rome but the color of it reminded you of the sunset in the grand canon by an american artist that they hang over the stove pipe holes in the salongs he was the reub without needing a touch you d have known him for one even if you d seen him on the vaudeville stage with one cotton suspender and a straw over his ear i told him what i wanted and found him ready to jump at the job overlooking such a trivial little peccadillo as the habit of manslaughter says i what have you accomplished in the way of indirect brigandage or nonactionable thriftiness that you could point to with or without pride as an evidence of your qualifications for the position why says he in his kind of southern system of procrastinated accents hain t you heard tell there ain t any man black or white in the blue ridge that can tote off a shoat as easy as i can without bein heard seen or cotched i can lift a shoat he goes on out of a pen from under a porch at the trough in the woods day or night anywhere or anyhow and i guarantee nobody won t hear a squeal it s all in the way you grab hold of em and carry em atterwards some day goes on this gentle despoiler of pig pens i hope to become reckernized as the champion shoat stealer of the world it s proper to be ambitious says i and hog stealing will do very well for mount nebo but in the outside world mr tatum it would be considered as crude a piece of business as a bear raid on bay state gas however it will do as a guarantee of good faith we ll go into partnership i ve got a thousand dollars cash capital and with that homeward plods atmosphere of yours we ought to be able to win out a few shares of soon parted preferred in the money market so i attaches rufe and we go away from mount nebo down into the lowlands and all the way i coach him for his part in the grafts i had in mind i had idled away two months on the florida coast and was feeling all to the ponce de leon besides having so many new schemes up my sleeve that i had to wear kimonos to hold em i intended to assume a funnel shape and mow a path nine miles wide though the farming belt of the middle west so we headed in that direction but when we got as far as lexington we found binkley brothers circus there and the blue grass peasantry romping into town and pounding the belgian blocks with their hand pegged sabots as artless and arbitrary as an extra session of a datto bryan drama i never pass a circus without pulling the valve cord and coming down for a little key west money so i engaged a couple of rooms and board for rufe and me at a house near the circus grounds run by a widow lady named peevy then i took rufe to a clothing store and gent s outfitted him he showed up strong as i knew he would after he was rigged up in the ready made rutabaga regalia me and old misfitzky stuffed him into a bright blue suit with a nile green visible plaid effect and riveted on a fancy vest of a light tuskegee normal tan color a red necktie and the yellowest pair of shoes in town they were the first clothes rufe had ever worn except the gingham layette and the butternut top dressing of his native kraal and he looked as self conscious as an igorrote with a new nose ring that night i went down to the circus tents and opened a small shell game rufe was to be the capper i gave him a roll of phony currency to bet with and kept a bunch of it in a special pocket to pay his winnings out of no i didn t mistrust him but i simply can t manipulate the ball to lose when i see real money bet my fingers go on a strike every time i try it i set up my little table and began to show them how easy it was to guess which shell the little pea was under the unlettered hinds gathered in a thick semicircle and began to nudge elbows and banter one another to bet then was when rufe ought to have single footed up and called the turn on the little joker for a few tens and fives to get them started but no rufe i d seen him two or three times walking about and looking at the side show pictures with his mouth full of peanut candy but he never came nigh the crowd piked a little but trying to work the shells without a capper is like fishing without a bait i closed the game with only forty two dollars of the unearned increment while i had been counting on yanking the yeomen for two hundred at least i went home at eleven and went to bed i supposed that the circus had proved too alluring for rufe and that he had succumbed to it concert and all but i meant to give him a lecture on general business principles in the morning just after morpheus had got both my shoulders to the shuck mattress i hears a houseful of unbecoming and ribald noises like a youngster screeching with green apple colic i opens my door and calls out in the hall for the widow lady and when she sticks her head out i says mrs peevy ma am would you mind choking off that kid of yours so that honest people can get their rest sir says she it s no child of mine it s the pig squealing that your friend mr tatum brought home to his room a couple of hours ago and if you are uncle or second cousin or brother to it i d appreciate your stopping its mouth sir yourself if you please i put on some of the polite outside habiliments of external society and went into rufe s room he had gotten up and lit his lamp and was pouring some milk into a tin pan on the floor for a dingy white half grown squealing pig how is this rufe says i you flimflammed in your part of the work to night and put the game on crutches and how do you explain the pig it looks like back sliding to me now don t be too hard on me jeff says he you know how long i ve been used to stealing shoats it s got to be a habit with me and to night when i see such a fine chance i couldn t help takin it well says i maybe you ve really got kleptopigia and maybe when we get out of the pig belt you ll turn your mind to higher and more remunerative misconduct why you should want to stain your soul with such a distasteful feeble minded perverted roaring beast as that i can t understand why jeff says he you ain t in sympathy with shoats you don t understand em like i do this here seems to me to be an animal of more than common powers of ration and intelligence he walked half across the room on his hind legs a while ago well i m going back to bed says i see if you can impress it upon your friend s ideas of intelligence that he s not to make so much noise he was hungry says rufe he ll go to sleep and keep quiet now i always get up before breakfast and read the morning paper whenever i happen to be within the radius of a hoe cylinder or a washington hand press the next morning i got up early and found a lexington daily on the front porch where the carrier had thrown it the first thing i saw in it was a double column ad on the front page that read like this five thousand dollars reward the above amount will be paid and no questions asked for the return alive and uninjured of beppo the famous european educated pig that strayed or was stolen from the side show tents of binkley bros circus last night geo b tapley business manager at the circus grounds i folded up the paper flat put it into my inside pocket and went to rufe s room he was nearly dressed and was feeding the pig the rest of the milk and some apple peelings well well well good morning all i says hearty and amiable so we are up and piggy is having his breakfast what had you intended doing with that pig rufe i m going to crate him up says rufe and express him to ma in mount nebo he ll be company for her while i am away he s a mighty fine pig says i scratching him on the back you called him a lot of names last night says rufe oh well says i he looks better to me this morning i was raised on a farm and i m very fond of pigs i used to go to bed at sundown so i never saw one by lamplight before tell you what i ll do rufe i says i ll give you ten dollars for that pig i reckon i wouldn t sell this shoat says he if it was any other one i might why not this one i asked fearful that he might know something why because says he it was the grandest achievement of my life there ain t airy other man that could have done it if i ever have a fireside and children i ll sit beside it and tell em how their daddy toted off a shoat from a whole circus full of people and maybe my grandchildren too they ll certainly be proud a whole passel why says he there was two tents one openin into the other this shoat was on a platform tied with a little chain i seen a giant and a lady with a fine chance of bushy white hair in the other tent i got the shoat and crawled out from under the canvas again without him squeakin as loud as a mouse i put him under my coat and i must have passed a hundred folks before i got out where the streets was dark i reckon i wouldn t sell that shoat jeff i d want ma to keep it so there d be a witness to what i done the pig won t live long enough i says to use as an exhibit in your senile fireside mendacity your grandchildren will have to take your word for it i ll give you one hundred dollars for the animal rufe looked at me astonished the shoat can t be worth anything like that to you he says what do you want him for viewing me casuistically says i with a rare smile you wouldn t think that i ve got an artistic side to my temper but i have i m a collector of pigs i ve scoured the world for unusual pigs over in the wabash valley i ve got a hog ranch with most every specimen on it from a merino to a poland china this looks like a blooded pig to me rufe says i i believe it s a genuine berkshire that s why i d like to have it i d shore like to accommodate you says he but i ve got the artistic tenement too i don t see why it ain t art when you can steal a shoat better than anybody else can shoats is a kind of inspiration and genius with me specially this one i wouldn t take two hundred and fifty for that animal now listen says i wiping off my forehead it s not so much a matter of business with me as it is art and not so much art as it is philanthropy being a connoisseur and disseminator of pigs i wouldn t feel like i d done my duty to the world unless i added that berkshire to my collection not intrinsically but according to the ethics of pigs as friends and coadjutors of mankind i offer you five hundred dollars for the animal jeff says this pork esthete it ain t money it s sentiment with me seven hundred says i make it eight hundred says rufe and i ll crush the sentiment out of my heart i went under my clothes for my money belt and counted him out forty twenty dollar gold certificates i ll just take him into my own room says i and lock him up till after breakfast i took the pig by the hind leg he turned on a squeal like the steam calliope at the circus let me tote him in for you says rufe and he picks up the beast under one arm holding his snout with the other hand and packs him into my room like a sleeping baby after breakfast rufe who had a chronic case of haberdashery ever since i got his trousseau says he believes he will amble down to misfitzky s and look over some royal purple socks and then i got as busy as a one armed man with the nettle rash pasting on wall paper i found an old negro man with an express wagon to hire and we tied the pig in a sack and drove down to the circus grounds i found george b tapley in a little tent with a window flap open he was a fattish man with an immediate eye in a black skull cap with a four ounce diamond screwed into the bosom of his red sweater are you george b tapley i asks i swear it says he well i ve got it says i designate says he are you the guinea pigs for the asiatic python or the alfalfa for the sacred buffalo neither says i i ve got beppo the educated hog in a sack in that wagon i found him rooting up the flowers in my front yard this morning i ll take the five thousand dollars in large bills if it s handy george b hustles out of his tent and asks me to follow we went into one of the side shows in there was a jet black pig with a pink ribbon around his neck lying on some hay and eating carrots that a man was feeding to him hey mac calls g b nothing wrong with the world wide this morning is there him no says the man he s got an appetite like a chorus girl at a m how d you get this pipe says tapley to me eating too many pork chops last night i pulls out the paper and shows him the ad fake says he don t know anything about it you ve beheld with your own eyes the marvelous world wide porcine wonder of the four footed kingdom eating with preternatural sagacity his matutinal meal unstrayed and unstole good morning i was beginning to see i got in the wagon and told uncle ned to drive to the most adjacent orifice of the nearest alley there i took out my pig got the range carefully for the other opening set his sights and gave him such a kick that he went out the other end of the alley twenty feet ahead of his squeal then i paid uncle ned his fifty cents and walked down to the newspaper office i wanted to hear it in cold syllables i got the advertising man to his window to decide a bet says i wasn t the man who had this ad put in last night short and fat with long black whiskers and a club foot he was not says the man he would measure about six feet by four and a half inches with corn silk hair and dressed like the pansies of the conservatory at dinner time i went back to mrs peevy s shall i keep some soup hot for mr tatum till he comes back she asks if you do ma am says i you ll more than exhaust for firewood all the coal in the bosom of the earth and all the forests on the outside of it so there you see said jefferson peters in conclusion how hard it is ever to find a fair minded and honest business partner but i began with the freedom of long acquaintance the rule should work both ways if you had offered to divide the reward you would not have lost jeff s look of dignified reproach stopped me that don t involve the same principles at all said he mine was a legitimate and moral attempt at speculation buy low and sell high don t wall street endorse it bulls and bears and pigs what s the difference why not bristles as well as horns and fur options the rose of dixie when the rose of dixie magazine was started by a stock company in toombs city georgia there was never but one candidate for its chief editorial position in the minds of its owners col aquila telfair was the man for the place by all the rights of learning family reputation and southern traditions he was its foreordained fit and logical editor so a committee of the patriotic georgia citizens who had subscribed the founding fund of called upon colonel telfair at his residence cedar heights fearful lest the enterprise and the south should suffer by his possible refusal the colonel received them in his great library where he spent most of his

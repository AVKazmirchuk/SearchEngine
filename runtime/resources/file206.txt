out the little brick and unwrapped my handkerchief off it one dollar and eighty cents says the farmer hefting it in his hand is it a trade the lead in it is worth more than that says i dignified i put it back in my pocket all right says he but i sort of wanted it for the collection i m starting i got a one last week for just then a telephone bell rings in the house come in bunk says the farmer and look at my place it s kind of lonesome here sometimes i think that s new york calling we went inside the room looked like a broadway stockbroker s light oak desks two phones spanish leather upholstered chairs and couches oil paintings in gilt frames a foot deep and a ticker hitting off the news in one corner hello hello says this funny farmer is that the regent theatre yes this is plunkett of woodbine centre reserve four orchestra seats for friday evening my usual ones yes friday good bye i run over to new york every two weeks to see a show says the farmer hanging up the receiver i catch the eighteen hour flyer at indianapolis spend ten hours in the heyday of night on the yappian way and get home in time to see the chickens go to roost forty eight hours later oh the pristine hubbard squasherino of the cave dwelling period is getting geared up some for the annual meeting of the don t blow out the gas association don t you think mr bunk i seem to perceive says i a kind of hiatus in the agrarian traditions in which heretofore i have reposed confidence sure bunk says he the yellow primrose on the river s brim is getting to look to us reubs like a holiday edition de luxe of the language of flowers with deckle edges and frontispiece just then the telephone calls him again hello hello says he oh that s perkins at milldale i told you was too much for that horse have you got him there good let me see him get away from the transmitter now make him trot in a circle faster yes i can hear him keep on faster yet that ll do now lead him up to the phone closer get his nose nearer there now wait no i don t want that horse what no not at any price he interferes and he s windbroken goodbye now bunk says the farmer do you begin to realize that agriculture has had a hair cut you belong in a bygone era why tom lawson himself knows better than to try to catch an up to date agriculturalist napping it s saturday the fourteenth on the farm you bet now look here and see how we keep up with the day s doings he shows me a machine on a table with two things for your ears like the penny in the slot affairs i puts it on and listens a female voice starts up reading headlines of murders accidents and other political casualities what you hear says the farmer is a synopsis of to day s news in the new york chicago st louis and san francisco papers it is wired in to our rural news bureau and served hot to subscribers on this table you see the principal dailies and weeklies of the country also a special service of advance sheets of the monthly magazines i picks up one sheet and sees that it s headed special advance proofs in july the century will say and so forth the farmer rings up somebody his manager i reckon and tells him to let that herd of jerseys go at a head and to sow the acre field in wheat and to have extra cans ready at the station for the milk trolley car then he passes the henry clays and sets out a bottle of green chartreuse and goes over and looks at the ticker tape consolidated gas up two points says he oh very well ever monkey with copper i asks stand back says he raising his hand or i ll call the dog i told you not to waste your time after a while he says bunk if you don t mind my telling you your company begins to cloy slightly i ve got to write an article on the chimera of communism for a magazine and attend a meeting of the race track association this afternoon of course you understand by now that you can t get my proxy for your remedy whatever it may be well sir all i could think of to do was to go out and get in the buggy the horse turned round and took me back to the hotel i hitched him and went in to see andy in his room i told him about this farmer word for word and i sat picking at the table cover like one bereft of sagaciousness i don t understand it says i humming a sad and foolish little song to cover my humiliation andy walks up and down the room for a long time biting the left end of his mustache as he does when in the act of thinking jeff says he finally i believe your story of this expurgated rustic but i am not convinced it looks incredulous to me that he could have inoculated himself against all the preordained systems of bucolic bunco now you never regarded me as a man of special religious proclivities did you jeff says andy well says i no but says i not to wound his feelings i have also observed many church members whose said proclivities were not so outwardly developed that they would show on a white handkerchief if you rubbed em with it i have always been a deep student of nature from creation down says andy and i believe in an ultimatum

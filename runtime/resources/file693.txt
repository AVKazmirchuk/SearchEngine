not an unnatural one in your circle i asked you to sit down if the invitation must con stitute me your honeysuckle consider it with drawn i earnestly beg your pardon pleaded the young ran his

you please of course i know now tell me about these people passing and crowding each way along these paths where are they going why do they hurry so are they happy the young man had promptly abandoned his air of coquetry his cue was now for a waiting part he could not guess the role be would be expected to play it is interesting to watch them he replied pos tulating her mood it is the wonderful drama of life some are going to supper and some to er other places one wonders what their histories are i do not said the girl i am not so inquisi tive i come here to sit because here only can i be

back on broadway this was but tit for tat be cause broadway had often done the same thing to miss d armande still the tats seemed to have it for the ex leading lady of the reaping the whirlwind company had everything to ask of broadway while there was no vice versa so miss lynnette d armande turned the back of her chair to her window that overlooked broadway and sat down to stitch in time the lisle thread heel of a black silk stocking the tumult and glitter of the roaring broadway beneath her window had no charm for her what she greatly desired was the stifling air of a dressing room on that fairyland street and the roar of an audience gathered in that capricious quarter in the meantime those stock ings must not be neglected silk does wear out so but after all isn t it just the only goods there is the hotel thalia looks on broadway as marathon looks on the sea it stands like a gloomy cliff above the whirlpool where the tides of two great thorough fares clash here the player bands gather at the end of their wanderings to loosen the buskin and dust the sock thick in the streets around it are booking offices theatres agents schools and the lobster pal aces to which those thorny paths lead wandering through the eccentric halls of the dim and fusty thalia you seem to have found yourself in some great ark or caravan about to sail or fly or roll away on wheels about the

audible visions of houris with veiled starry eyes flying tag ends of things and a swish of silk bequeathing to the dull hallways an odor of gaiety and a memory of frangipanni serious young comedians with versatile adam s apples gather in doorways and talk of booth far reaching from somewhere comes the smell of ham and red cabbage and the crash of dishes on the american plan the indeterminate hum of life in the thalia is enlivened by the discreet popping at reasonable and salubrious intervals of beer bottle corks thus punctuated life in the genial hostel scans easily the comma being the favorite mark semicolons frowned upon and periods barred miss d armannde s room was a small one there was room for her rocker between the dresser and the wash stand if it were placed longitudinally on the dresser were its usual accoutrements plus the ex lead ing lady s collected souvenirs of road engagements and photographs of her dearest and best professional friends at one of these photographs
